Used to live in a poor neighborhood
My friends and me we always had a time
Never had no money but we had it so good
Those days are gone and I wanna go back
So pure so simple
Never thought about it when you're young you don't care
You don't realize it 'till it's all behind
Take it for granted just not well


Oh-oh It was pure and simple
I'll remember those days 'till the end
Oh-oh God knows it's simple
If I could live my life all over again
I'd keep it pure and simple

Those days are gone and I wanna go back
Got me a feelin' I'm not alone
Wish I had a road so I could go back home

Oh-oh It was pure and simple
I'll remember those days 'till the end
Oh-oh God knows it's simple
If I could live my life all over again
I'd keep it pure and simple

Oh-oh It was pure and simple
I'll remember those days 'till the end
Oh-oh God knows it's simple
If I could live my life all over again
I'd keep it pure and simple
