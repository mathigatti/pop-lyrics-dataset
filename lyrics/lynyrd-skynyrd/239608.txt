Here I sit all by myself 
Wonderin' how she could put our love on a shelf 
A crowd of people, they pass me by 
But all I can do is hang my head and cry


(chorus) 
Blame it on a sad song in the night 
I don't want anyone but you to make it right 
Blame it on a sad song in the night 
Well, it's an old familiar feelin' 
Girl, it's got my heart reelin' 
Don't want to hear a sad song in the night 
Anymore

I know when we first started out 
I was your only love and you had no doubt 
But songs of the heart don't last forever 
But don't you give up on love 'cause you never say never

Blame it on a sad song in the night 
I don't want anyone but you to make it right 
Blame it on a sad song in the night 
Well, it's an old familiar feelin' 
Girl, it's got my heart reelin' 
Don't want to hear a sad song in the night 
Anymore

'Cause not a day goes by that I don't think about you 
Oh, moment to moment, I get lost in time 
And many years from now when I hear that song come on the radio 
All those feelings will come back to haunt me 
My heart will let me know

Blame it on a sad song in the night 
I don't want anyone but you to make it right 
Blame it on a sad song in the night 
Well, it's an old familiar feelin' 
Girl, it's got my heart reelin' 
Don't want to hear a sad song anymore

Blame it on a sad song 
You can blame it on a sad song, baby 
Blame it on, blame it on a sad song
