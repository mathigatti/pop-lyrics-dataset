I snuck around the corner he had his guard down 
I threw the first punch that's when he hit the ground 
To survive in the street you gotta win the first round 
'Cause if you want eat you gotta be the baddest one around 
I'm a backstreet crawler


Daddy paid for college I earned a degree 
Got a job up on Wall Street 
Where I learned to make the little man bleed 
That's when I got stomped like a cattle stampede 
Had a nervous breakdown all my friends and family left me

(chorus)
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler 
When you see them on the concrete it's their spirit that's
harder 
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler 
Where your ego meets defeat and your pride can't get no smaller 
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler 
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler
(repeat)

I guess you might say it sure is a shame 
I used to have everything oh how my life has changed 
Yeah I'm broken and torn I've never been free 
Lost everything that meant a thing to me

(repeat chorus)
