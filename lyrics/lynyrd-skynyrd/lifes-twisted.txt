Just when you think you got it figured out
It comes along and hits you in the mouth
You think your day can’t get no worse
Your heaven falls and hits you where it hurts
You wake up smilin’ on a sunny day
The clouds roll in, then it’s pourin’ rain


If you blink you’ll miss it
Cause life’s twisted

Like a black snake on a highway
Like a flat tire on a Friday
If you let it man it’s gonna kick your ass
Life’s twisted like a backroad in the country
Like a switchblade in an alley
Lemme tell ya boy you better watch your back
Cause life’s twisted like that
Life’s twisted

You build your dreams with your own two hands
You find out life has other plans
You think you finally found the right way out
You’re drivin’ north, but you’re flying south

Sometimes you gotta risk it
Cause life’s twisted

Like a black snake on a highway
Like a flat tire on a Friday
If you let it man it’s gonna kick your ass
Life’s twisted like a backroad in the country
Like a switchblade in an alley
Lemme tell ya boy you better watch your back
Cause life’s twisted like that

Sometimes you gotta bend until you break
But you can shake it off to fight another day
You only get one time around, don’t let it slip away
Oh!, life’s twisted

Like a black snake on a highway
Like a flat tire on a Friday
If you let it boy it’s gonna kick your ass
Like a backroad in the country
Like a switchblade in an alley
Lemme tell ya man you better watch your back life’s twisted

Like a black snake on a highway
Like a flat tire on a Friday
If you let it man it’s gonna kick your ass
Life’s twisted like a backroad in the country
Like a switchblade in an alley
Lemme tell ya boy you better watch your back
Life’s twisted like that
