Money can't buy ya happiness
And that drinkin' can cause you pain
Yeah that stuff you put up your nose
It can drive you insane
Why do you do these things?
You're killing yourself each day
So you better get down on your knees
And ask the good Lord to take it away


Let the rain stop fallin'
Let the sun shine again
Let your heart stop cryin'
Let the good Lord be with you my friend
And start livin' life again

Time with your family is precious
Take a good look at yourself
You've been burning the candle at both ends
Don't you think it's time to got help?
Ooh, let your spirit fly and you won't need to get high anymore
Ask him into your life
'Cause he can open up any door!

Let the rain stop fallin'
Let the sun shine again
Let your heart stop cryin'
Let the good Lord be with you my friend
Start livin' life again
Start livin' life again
Just live again...
