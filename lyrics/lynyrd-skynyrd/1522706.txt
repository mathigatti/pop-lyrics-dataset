Broken bones, broken hearts
Stripped down and torn apart
A little bit of rust
I'm still running


Counting miles, counting tears
Twisted road, shifting gears
Year after year
It's all or nothing

But I'm not home
I'm not lost
Still holding on to what I got
Ain't much left
No there's so much that's been stolen

Guess I've lost everything I've had
But I'm not dead, at least not yet
Still alone, still alive
Still unbroken
I'm still alone, still alive
I'm still unbroken

Never captured, never tamed
Wild horses on the plains
You can call me lost
I call it freedom

I feel the spirit, in my soul
It's something Lord I can't control
I'm never giving up
While I'm still breathing

I'm not home
I'm not lost
Still holding on to what I got
Ain't much left
No there's so much that's been stolen

Guess I've lost everything I've had
I'm not dead, at least not yet
Still alone, still alive
Still unbroken
I'm still alone, still alive
Still unbroken

I'm still unbroken
Still unbroken

Like the wind, like the rain
It's all running through my veins
Like a river pouring out into the ocean

I'm out here on the street
But I'm standing on my feet
Still alive, still alone
Still unbroken
Yeah!

I'm not home
I'm not lost
Still holding on to what I got
Ain't much left
Lord there's so much that's been stolen

Guess I've lost everything I've had
But I'm not dead, at least not yet
Still alive, still alone
Still unbroken
I'm still alone, still alive
I'm still unbroken
I'm still alone, still alive
Still unbroken

I'm still unbroken
I ain't never going down
I'm still unbroken
Ohh
