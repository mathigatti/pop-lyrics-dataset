Oh yeah!

Got a pocket full of mem'ries and my song
Got to keep on movin' and rollin' on
When I'm playin' for keeps, I always win
Don't know where I'm going, but I know where I've been
Yeah!


Lookin' back when I was a boy
A hand-me-down bike was my toy
A barefoot brother who gave me hell
I learned from the best, he taught me well

I hear that highway callin'!

Oh, feel the breeze
I been a rambler and a gambler, Lord, I'm free
Saddle up, baby, ride up close to me
An open highway's all I'll ever need
Last of a dying breed
Last of the dying breed

One-horse towns and one-night stands
Just like my daddy - I'm a travelin' man
I'm not the kind to settle down
The roar of the engine - I love that sound

I hear that highway callin'!

Oh, feel the breeze
I been a rambler and a gambler, lord I'm free
Saddle up baby, ride up close to me
An open highway's all I'll ever need
Last of a dying breed
Last of the dying breed

Last of a dying breed

Oh, feel the breeze
I been a rambler and a gambler, lord I'm free
Yeah saddle up baby, ride up close to me
An open highway's all I'll ever need, yeah
A wide open highway's all I'll ever need
Last of a dying breed
Last of the dying breed
Oh yeah!
Last of a dying breed
