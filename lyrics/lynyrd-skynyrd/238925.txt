I've got a sayin' in my life that's got me by so far 
Well it mat not be right but, nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong 
The first mistake is leave it up to somebody else 
If you want somethin' done you got to do it yourself 
I'll do it myself before somebody makes a fool out of me


(chorus) 
'Cause nothin' comes easy for a man like me 
Everybody thinks the best things in life are free 
If they would open their eyes it'd be so plain to see 
That the best things in life don't come so easily

I met a man who thought just a little bit different from me 
He said you got it so easy but I just had to disagree 
It would have been alright but he pushed me too far 
If your lookin' for trouble step outside of this bar 
IF it comes down to fistin', mister that ain't nothin' new to me

(repeat chorus)

You'll find in this life if there's somethin' that you believe 
You got to get your hands dirty when it's somethin' that you
really need 
If they ever give you somethin' too easily 
Can't be too good, 'cause nothin' good's for free 
Tell ya' straight from the heart a bed of roses it will never be
