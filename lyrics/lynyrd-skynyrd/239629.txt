I've always lived my life like a gypsy 
I can't imagine myself settlin' down 
So please don't ask me to give up this life I lead 
'Cause I love to feel those wheels go 'round and 'round


(chorus) 
I can see it inside 
It's my heart that sees, not my eyes 
And if you listen close I'll tell you why 
Home is where the heart is 
And my heart is at home with you

There's a cold wind blowin' and you know it's almost midnight 
You never dreamed it would be this hard lovin' a music man 
But this iron horse on which I ride I'm closer it's true 
And it's just as hard for me as it is for you

I can see it inside 
It's my heart that sees not my eyes 
And if you listen close I'll tell you why 
Home is where the heart is 
And my heart is at home with you

In my life I'm always on the run 
Livin' one day at a time 
Hold on a little longer 
I don't know where I'm gonna end up 
Or where I'll go

I can see it inside 
It's my heart that sees not my eyes 
And if you listen close I'll tell you why 
Home is where the heart is 
And my heart is at home ...

I can see it inside 
It's my heart that sees not my eyes 
And if you listen close I'll tell you why 
Home is where the heart is 
And my heart is at home with you

Home is where the heart is 
Oh ,my home is where my heart is 
Oh, my home is where my heart is
