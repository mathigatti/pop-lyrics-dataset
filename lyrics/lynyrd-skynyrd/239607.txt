I can still remember I was eight years old 
The first time that I picked her up little did I know 
She's taken me to places that I've never been 
Did my first gig in a rock-n-roll band 
Berneice, sweet Berneice


Get a real job let the guitar go 
There ain't no future in this rock-n-roll 
So go for your guitars, go for your guns 
Better think twice it's three against one 
Take your best shot it's a showdown now 
Berneice, sweet Berneice 
Oh, Berneice won't you play for me


A guitar woman needs a guitar man 
One without the other, neither one of them can stand 
Remember where we came from we can do it all again 
So thanks to all you people, give youselves a hand 
Berneice, sweet Berneice 
Berneice, won't you play for me
