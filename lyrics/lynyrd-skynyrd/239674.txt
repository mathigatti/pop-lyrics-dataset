Up every mornin' before the sun takin my lovin on the run
Breakin my back till the day is done I'm gonna punch that time
clock
And have some fun ain't no easy way to get myself out


So - I keep on workin' like a workin' man do
I gotta buy my baby shoes I keep on workin' it's the only to do
I make my livin' by the sweat of my brow oh workin' just like
you - uh

I was raised on the poor side of town I made my livin' movin'
around
I never let no one dog me down - oh I was taught to stand my
ground
Like was always changin' that's just the way it is

So I keep on workin' like a workin' man do
I got to buy my baby shoes I keep on workin'
It's the only thing to do I make my livin' by the sweat of my
brow

Oh - workin' just like you uh oh oh oh oh - I keep on workin'

Ooh - I keep on workin'like a workin' man do
I need to buy my baby shoes
I keep on workin' it's the only thing to do
I make my livin' by the sweat of my brow oh - workin' just like
you

Aaah ah ah ah aaah ah ah ah I keep on workin' - workin'
I keep on workin' - workin' I keep on workin' - workin'
I keep on workin' - workin' uh oh oh oh
