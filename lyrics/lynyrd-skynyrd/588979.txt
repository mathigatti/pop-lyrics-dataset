I'm headed down a highway, got my suitcase by my side
Blue skies hangin' over my head, I got five hundred miles to ride
I'm goin' down to Memphis town to play a late night show
I hope the people are ready there 'cause the boys are all ready to go


Well, I'm a whiskey rock-a-roller, that's what I am
Women, whiskey and miles of travelin is all I understand

Yes, I was born a travelin man and my feets do burn the ground
I don't care for fancy music if your shoes can't shuffle around
I got a hundred women or more and there's no place I call home
The only time I'm satisfied is when I'm on the road

Well, I'm a whiskey rock-a-roller, that's what I am
Women, whiskey and miles of travelin' is all I understand

Sometimes I wonder where will we go
Lord, don't you take my whiskey and rock'n'roll

Take me down to Memphis town, busdriver, get me there
I got me a queenie, she got long black curly hair
She likes to drink Old Grandad and her shoes do shuffle around
And everytime I see that girl, Lord, she wants to take me down

Well, I'm a whiskey rock-a-roller, that's what I am
Women, whiskey and miles of travelin' is all I understand

Sometimes I wonder where will we go
Lord, don't you take my whiskey and rock'n'roll
