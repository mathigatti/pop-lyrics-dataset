She'd wake us up early every mornin' 
She'd help us say our prayers every night 
She was always there to help us through the hard times 
We could count on her to make everything alright


I remember swingin' on the front porch 
Papa said there's somethin' I need to say tonight 
Mama's been sick for a long time 
Let's pray to God she can make it through the night

(chorus)
Mama don't wanna say goodbye 
She said wipe those tears from your eyes 
Mama I don't wanna say goodbye 
It was written in the Heavens and the skies above 
Son I gave you birth showed you all my love 
I can't think of this life without you it's hard to try 
Mama I'm afraid to say goodbye

Now kids I've been hangin' on a long time 
I hate to leave this world before your grown 
Remember everything that I've taught you 
Remember all the good times when I'm gone

(repeat chorus)

She whispered in my ear before she passed away 
Son it's time to be a man ain't nothin' left to say 
Jesus walked on water I know it's true 
When it comes time he'll call you home 
I hope your ready too

(repeat chorus)
