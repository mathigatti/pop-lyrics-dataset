In this world that we all live in 
Its all takin' and there's no givin' 
Before its too late,somethings gotta change 


Go to work every day for the dollar 
Doesn't matter we're all blue collar 
At the end of the day 
Nothin' lost, nothin' gained 
But its about time we realized 
Its about time we opened our eyes 
Take one step back and look at yourself 
Do you like what you see 
Oh no 
Cause its never too late 
Doesn't matter who you are 
Its never too late 
Hold on to your dreams and they will take you far 
Cause its never too late 
No, no, no 

So many times I've seen you cryin' 
But I see you out there still tryin' 
Workin' hard just to get through another day 
As a freind I'm here to remind you 
We all have a place to belong to 
Who am I? See I'm just like you 
But its about time we realized 
Its about time we opened our eyes 
Take one step back and look at yourself 
Do you like what you see 
Oh no 
Cause its never too late 
Doesn't matter who you are 
Its never too late 
Hold on to your dreams and they will take you far 
Cause its never too late 

We all need a helpin' hand sometimes 
And I need one if you were mine 
So right here, right now 
You can count on me 
Just open your eyes and you will see 
That its never too late 
No,no,no 
Cause its never too late, it doesn't matter who you are 
Its never too late 
Hold on to your dreams and they will take you far 
Cause its never too late 
Cause its never too late, it doesn't matter who you are 
Its never too late 
You don't need a guitar son to be a star 
Cause its never too late 
No, no, no 
Its never too late 
No 
Cause its never too late 
Take a look around 
Cause its never too late
