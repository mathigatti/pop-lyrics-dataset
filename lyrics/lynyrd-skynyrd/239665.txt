Well, the sun don't shine where it used to
And the angels are hidin' their heads
People don't listen to their hearts anymore
Seems the good men all are dead
There ain't no right, wrong, no in between
That ain't the constitution that they wrote for me
Got our heads stuck in somethin' overseas
Standin' ass deep in hypocracy


Well I found myself out on the open road
Heading out into the desert
Lookin' for another world that's waitin' on me
That none of us can see
I keep thinkin' to myself as I move along
Where do we all come from
Is there religion or another dimension
Another place and time, yeah

When my life is over and done
Finally made my way through it
Another life has just begun
Is this the way you do it?
Oh, the way

Lookin' in the eyes of the man on the moon
He's starin' down at me
Wondering what he's thinkin' and if he knows
Please let me see

Life is like an open door we're all walkin' through
Do you know the answers, no one knows the truth
Until we pass on through

When my life is over and done
Finally made my way through it
Another life has just begun
Is this the way to it?

Walkin' on the world upside down
It keeps spinnin' round and round
World upside down
I'm so tired of all this bullshit goin' down
Finally made my way through it
When my life is over and done
Is this the way you do it
When my life is over and done
Finally made my way through it
Another life has just begun
This is the way you do it
Oh the way
This is the way you do it
Oh the way
