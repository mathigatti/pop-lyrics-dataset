Well them four walls of Raiford, closing in on me 
Doin' three to five hard labor, for armed robbery 
I had two years behind, but I could not wait the time 
Everytime I thought about it, well I died some more inside


And I had stripes on my back, memories that hurt 
For the only time I seen sunshine is when I hit the dirt 
Diggin' ditches for the chain gang, sleepin' in the cold 
Oh Lord please forgive me for I could not wait no more

And I comin' home to see you Jesus 
Well it feels so close this time 
Please take mercy on this soldier 
From the Florida-Georgia line

When they find me they must kill me 
Oh Jesus save my soul 
I can't go back down to Raiford 
I can't take that anymore

Well these last few years behind me 
Oh Lord, have been so sad 
I fought proudly for my country when the times were bad 
Now they say I'm guilty, when they find me I must die 
Only me and Jesus know that I never stole a dime

Well when Vietnam was over there was no work here for me 
I had a pretty wife awaitin and two kids I had to feed 
Well I'm one of America's heroes and when they shoot me down 
Won't fly old Glory proudly, put my medals in the ground

And I comin' home to see you Jesus 
Well it feels so close this time 
Please take mercy on this soldier 
From the Florida-Georgia line

When they find me they must kill me 
Oh Jesus save my soul 
I can't go back down to Raiford 
I can't take that anymore
