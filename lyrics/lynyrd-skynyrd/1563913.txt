Last night I heard this politician
Talking 'bout his brand new mission
'Liked his plans, but they came undone
When he got around with God and guns


I don't know how he grew up
But it sure wasn't down at the hunting club
Cause if it was he'd understand
Just a little bit more about the working man

God and guns
Keep us strong
That's what this country
Was founded on
Well we might aswell give up and run
If we let them take our God and guns

Yeah, out here in my neck of the woods
Where God is great and guns are good
You really can't know that much about 'em
If you think we're better off without 'em

Well there was a time we ain't forgot
You could rest all night with the doors unlocked
But there ain't nobody safe no more
So you say your prayers and you thank the Lord

For that peace maker
In the dresser drawer

God and guns (God and guns)
Keep us strong
That's what this country, Lord
Was founded on
Well we might aswell give up and run
If we let 'em take our God and guns
Yea we might aswell give up and run
If we let 'em take our God and guns!

Yeah
God and guns

Don't let 'em take
Don't you let 'em take
Don't let 'em take
Our God and guns

Oh, God and guns (God and guns)
Ye keep us strong
That's what this country, Lord
Was founded on
Well we might aswell give up and run
If we let 'em take our God and guns!

God and guns
