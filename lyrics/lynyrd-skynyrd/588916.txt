Well, there's a devil in the bottle, staring straight at me 
Daring me to reach out, but I know he's testing me 
If I take just one sip, I become that devil's son 
Act a fool, sell my soul before God and everyone 
Oh Lord, I know, I only hurt the ones I love


I'm walkin' down this dead end road, all alone and by myself 
Wish I could blame the whiskey, but I can only blame myself 
Running out of chances, and Lord that's such a crime 
I got to find the answer before I lose my mind 
Oh Lord its a cryin shame, oh Lord I've caused so much pain 
I only hurt the ones I love

There's a devil in a bottle that just won't let me be 
So many times I've been hurtin' my soul and family 
But I got free on the day I fought the 
Devil in the bottle 

The next time that ol' devil tries to get the best of me 
I'll smash that bottle against the wall and know I'm finally free 
There's a devil in a bottle that just won't let me be 
There's so many times I let him hurt me 
I got free the day I fought the 
Devil in the bottle 
Devil in the bottle 
Devil in the bottle
