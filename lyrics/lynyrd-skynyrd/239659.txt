Here we go...
C'mon...


I was raised on the west side Shanty Town
I didn't get up 'til the sun went down
When your backs against the wall you better get tough
I learned real quick how to swing and duck

I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine
Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine
Learned more about life on the streets than in school
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool (No she didn't) 

Hahahaha...  
Ooooohhh...

Some folks cheat and some folks lie
I can judge a man by the look in his eyes
So don't hand me Jack and try to call it Cola
I know the difference 'tween shit and shinola

I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine
Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine
Learned more about life on the streets than in the school
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool (No she didn't) 

Play it boys..
MMmmHhmmm...

Mama was no angel when she taught me right from wrong
She knew every single note and every word in every single song
She taught me how to gamble and how to roll the dice
If it makes you feel good DO IT don't think twice

I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine
Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine
Learned more about life on the streets than in school
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool

I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine
Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine
Learned more about life on the streets than in school
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool (Noooooo...)

Talkin' 'bout Mama
Ooooh I'm tellin' ya sheee...
Talkin' 'bout sweet, sweet sweet Mama
Talkin' 'bout sweet sweet sweet, sweet sweet Mama
Talkin' 'bout sweet sweet sweet, sweet sweet Mama
Talkin' 'bout sweeeeeeeeeet Mama
