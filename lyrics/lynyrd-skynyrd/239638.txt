I don't read the paper, I don't watch the news 
Life's good in this small town, population 62 
Our bank ain't been held-up since 1932 
Our doors are always unlocked 
But not for long I'm tellin' you


(chorus) 
'Cause I know time's are gonna change 
I know life will never be the same 
I see please tell me it ain't so 
They're all movin' in surroundin' me 
No place left to go 
My oh my you can kiss your freedom goodbye



Used to have a small town drugstore 
Where old men liked to meet 
That store's gone out of business 
They're sellin' drugs out in the streets 
The new kids like to spray paint 
They've got a lot to say 
Sure do have a way with words 
Taught me a few today

(chorus) 
'Cause I know time's are gonna change 
I know life will never be the same 
I see small town folks like me 
Are gonna have to change the way we do things cause eventually 
My oh my you can kiss your freedom goodbye 
Kiss it goodbye

(repeat 1st chorus)

(repeat 2nd chorus)
