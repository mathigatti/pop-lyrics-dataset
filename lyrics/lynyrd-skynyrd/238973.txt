MMMMMmmmmmm...

I listen, and still I haven't heard
Tell me what is the word
And if I ever heard it would it be clear as water
Oh tears run down your face
Reflects the human race
We're all caught up with winnin' losin time and space


Life's lessons
So you think you know it all
But you're headin' for a fall
Ooh to make it back again
You'll have to crawl and step back
Take a look around
Are your feet still on the ground
Can we find you in the section of lost and found

Never think you got it figured out
'Cause when you do you begin to doubt
It's time for you to open your eyes

Will we look back and see what we've done
Will we be proud or ashamed of what we've become
Will we realize we all share one fate
Or is this another life's lesson... Too late

OOohhh...

Will we look back and see what we've done
OOohhh...OOohhh...
Will we realize we all share one fate
OOOohhhh life's lessons
OOohhh...OOohhh...OOohhh yeah life's lessons
Ooohh... life's lessons

Will we look back and see what we've done
Will we realize we all share one fate
