Out of all the reindeer you know you're the mastermind
Run, run rudolph, randalph's not too far behind
Run, run rudolph, santa's got to make it to town
Randalph he can hurry, he can take the freeway down.


And away went rudolph a-whizzing like a merry-go-round
Said santa to a boy child what have you been longing for?
All I want for christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar
And away went rudolph a-whizzing like a shooting star
Run, run rudolph, santa's got to make it to town

Can't you make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went rudolph a-whizzing like a merry-go-round
Said santa to a girl child what would you like most to get?
I want a little baby doll that can cry, scream and wet
And away went rudolph a-whizzing like a saber jet
Run, run rudolph, run, run rudolph, a-running like a
son-of-a-gun
