Now Mama's in the kitchen cookin'
And her children are fast asleep
It's time for Santa Claus to make his midnight creep 'cause


Santa Claus wants some lovin'
Santa Claus wants some lovin'

I know there's something real pretty
Underneath that Christmas tree
But I ain't had no lovin' and it's wearin' me 'cause

Santa Claus wants some lovin'
Santa Claus wants some lovin'

Now I been trying to fix this old bicycle
Can't seem to find my pliers
Halfway watchin' Mama for that sleep in her eyes 'cause

Santa Claus wants some lovin'
Santa Claus wants some lovin'

I don't want no turkey
Don't care about no cake
I want you to come here Mama 'fore the children wake 'cause

Santa Claus wants some lovin'
Santa Claus wants some lovin'

Now Christmas is for the children
And I want them to be real pleased
But right now Mama it's Christmas Eve
Come make your Papa happy please

Santa Claus wants some lovin'
Santa Claus wants some lovin'
