Well, you can see her walkin' down on Peachtree Street
She got high-heeled shoes and a dot on her cheek
She's lookin' good, she's headed downtown
Ain't got no money, honey
She knows her way around
I think she's cute, think she's cute as she can be
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach


Well these Georgia Peaches
Son they know their way around
They can take your money, son before you get sight of town
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine
Nine out of ten of them gonna sell you a dime
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach

Well, peaches, peaches
Love them Georgia Peaches
Peaches, peaches
Love them Georgia Peaches

Well them Georgia Peaches
Sure do got the style
They'll steal your heart with a Southern smile
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine
Older they get, I swear it's like good wine
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach


I just seem to fall in love with the wrong things
