Hey, when is the last time you sat down and had dinner with your kids?
Talked about what's going on in their lives?
Hey, when is the last time you just stopped and helped somebody out?
I bet you can't remember


Well younger people are sayin'
'We're changing for the better'
Well that don't interest me

I like the simple life the way it used to be
We left our doors wide open
We didn't need no key
I've been around the world seen all there is to see
I'd trade all those memories for one more day
How it used to be
I like the simple life

I wanna get up sunday mornin'
Go fishin' with my boy
Watch the sunset kick back in my yard
Take my Harley on a real long lazy sunday drive
And do a little more nothin' once in a while

Yeah maybe kick my feet up
Maybe watch a little re-run on TV
Laughin' with ol' Barney, Andy and Aunt Bee

I like the simple life the way it used to be
We left our doors wide open
We didn't need no key
I've been around the world seen all there is to see
I'd trade all those memories for one more day
How it used to be
I like the simple life
Whooa ooh

Yeah everything's going by so fast
I swear sometimes we just can't see
So caught up in where we're trying to get
Life as we know it, could be gone in a minute

I like the simple life the way it used to be
We left our doors wide open
We didn't need no key
I've been around the world seen all there is to see
I'd trade all those memories for one more day
I like the simple life
I like the simple life
I want the simple life yeaaah
