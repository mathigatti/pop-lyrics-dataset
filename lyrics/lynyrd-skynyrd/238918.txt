Every time I think I got it all figured out 
Then I draw a blank and my whole world crashes down 
So many people have got it worse than me 
But that could change tomorrow, ain't no guarantee


(chorus) 
How soon we forget 
To count every blessing 
If you think you got it bad take a look around 
How soon we forget 
That life is one big lesson 
Still we make the same mistakes time and time again 
How soon we forget

Got a freind of mine who says he's run all out of luck 
But he'll be fine, 'cause he just ain't drunk enough 
The world is empty when you're slammin' those shots down 
How can you be happy, son when the devil's hangin' 'round 

How soon we forget 
To count every blessing 
If you think you got it bad take a look around 
How soon we forget 
That life is one big lesson 
Still we make the same mistakes time and time again 
How soon we forget 
How soon we forget

Just remember, thank God you're here today 
If you got the will you can find a way

How soon we forget... oh, baby

How soon we forget 
To count every blessing 
If you think you got it bad take a look around 
How soon we forget 
That life is one big lesson 
Still we make the same mistakes time and time again 
There's a message to this madness here my freind 
Will we ever learn before the story ends

Soon we all forget 
How soon we forget 
Soon we forget.. ooh 
Take a look around and you will see 
Soon we all forget... oh

So many people have got it worse than me 
Oh.. can't you see 
How soon we all forget
