My baby came home late last night 
I said girl I gotta talk to you 
I've been drinkin' with the man next door 
He said he's been singin' with you 
Whoever's tellin' lies it's time to say bye-bye 
You know my mama didn't raise no fool


(chorus)
You're gonna walk out that door you'll never see me anymore 
Tell you what I'm gonna do 
I'm gonna love ya' just one more time 
I'd love to see what you've got 
I don't care if it takes all night 
Gonna make you remember for the rest of your life oh baby 
We had a good thing a good thing goin' 
But ain't been seein' eye to eye 
You had a good thing but it's all over 
Might as well wave and say goodbye

It's easy to see the guilt in your eyes 
Girl I want you to tell me the truth 
Was he worth the risk and all the trouble he's caused 
Now it comes down to me and you 
You thought I was blind when you were gone all the time 
Playin' me for a fool

(repeat chorus)

We had a good thing goin' baby but it's all over

Good thing, good thing goin'.......
