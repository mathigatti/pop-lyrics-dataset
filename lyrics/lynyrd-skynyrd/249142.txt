                            I hit it from worst ways

                            In pounds better than quarters
                            I smoking two joints

                            So grab the estinguisher
                            I smoked out in the beamer

                            With more stripe than the bengals
                            No need for the gang sign
                            I'm using my trigga finga

                            [Happy P]

                            Po the four one
                            Sometimes I'm real selfish and I'll

                            [Chorus: Grimm]

                            I smoke two joints when I wake up
                            In the car I smoke two joints 
                            I smoke two joints when in play
video games
                            And every 10,000 points
                            I smoke two joints in time of peace
                            And two in time of war 
                            I smoke two joints before I smoke
two joints
                            And then I smoke two more
