Woman lose my number
You can't get to me
My pockets ain't deep enough
Your eyes were seeing green
I caught you lyin', you're a cheat
Oh Lord shame on me
I loved you once
Tried you twice
But you've become bad company


Somebody call the rescue
'Cause I think I'm on the edge
Yeah you're just like a sledgehammer
You keep poundin' in my head
While you were on the phone lyin' to me
You were lyin' next to who
It ain't nothing to do about the heartache
It's just a little thing called you

All my friends did tell me
But I could not believe
Well you were doin' me wrong
When I was gone
How wicked can you be?

Yeah a black cat crosses many roads
Chills you to the bone
I might be hurt, but I won't cry
'Cause I'm a man that's not alone

Somebody call the rescue
'Cause I think I'm on the edge
Yeah you're just like a sledgehammer
You keep poundin' in my head
While you were on the phone lyin' to me
You were lyin' next to who
It ain't nothing to do about the heartache
It's just a little thing called you

Somebody call the rescue
'Cause I think I'm on the edge
Yeah you're just like a sledgehammer
Girl you're poundin' in my head
While you were on the phone lyin' to me
You were lyin' next to who
It ain't nothing to do about the heartache
Yeah it ain't nothing to do about the heartache
It's just a little thing called you
A LITTLE THING CALLED YOU!
A LITTLE THING CALLED YOU!
