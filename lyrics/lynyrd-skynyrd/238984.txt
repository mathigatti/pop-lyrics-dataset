This is a story 'bout livin' 
A tale of a long hard road 
Ain't a whole lot of misgivin's 
Of the things that I thought I sowed 
My daddy was a real hard worker 
He said son there will come a day 
Talk ain't always cheap 
And here's what daddy had to say 
With these hands I've made my livin' 
With these hands I've held a child 
With these hands I've climbed a mountain 
Sometimes we forget 
We ain't much different at all 


He likes grits, you like the apple 
There ain't nothin' wrong with that 
He says y'all, you say you'se 
It all depends on where you're at 
Well a little bit of music is a whole lot of fun 
And its always good for the soul 
From New York City out to California 
You know its only rock and roll 

With these hands we come together 
With these hands we can change the world 
With these hands I play my music 
Sometimes we forget 
We ain't much different at all 

Oh, not at all 
So what I'm trying to tell you 
Is that I'm only one son of the South 
Its gonna take more than you me and you 
To work this whole thing out 

With these hands I've made my livin' 
With these hands I've held a child 
With these hands I've climbed a mountain 
Sometimes we forget 

With these hands we come together 
With these hands we can change the world 
With these hands I play my music 
Sometimes we forget 
We ain't much different 
We ain't much different 
Ain't much different 
At all
