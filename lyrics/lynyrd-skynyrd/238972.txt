Oh. Now when you think the time's bad
Take a look around
'Cause babies are dying from disease
Sleeping out on the ground
People never seen the tortured eyes
From a foreign land. No
When you see somebody who's down and out
Lend a helpin' hand
You better, lend a helpin' hand. If you can
Lend a helpin' hand
Do it if you can


Oh. Every time you feed your face
Do you bow your head
Hunger kills each and every day
Won't you share your bread
If you've ever felt the pain inside
I know you'd understand
When you see somebody who's down and out
Lend a helpin' hand
You better, lend a helpin' hand. If you can
Lend a helpin' hand
Do it if you can

Oh. Every time you feed that face
Do you look around
For somebody right in your own neighborhood
Sleepin out on the ground
And do some down south jukin'
If you've ever felt the pain inside
I know you'd understand
When you see somebody who's down and out
Lend a helpin' hand
Why don't you, lend a helpin' hand. If you can
Lend a helpin' hand
Won't you please lend a helpin' hand
