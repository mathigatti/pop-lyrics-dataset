Your love does something to me that I can't describe 
Dark eyes see right through me and I just can't hide 
You drive me crazy with what you don't say and the way you hold
back love 
Tell me tell me won't you please please tell me 
Need an answer from above
There you are, You're my desire, and here I am 
I'd be a liar if I said... 


I ain't gonna crawl 
You ain't gonna nail my heart to the wall 
You ain't gonna find me crying like a child just asking for it
all 
I ain't gonna beg, I'd rather lose it all instead 
If that is what it takes to get you Part of me just might let
you 
For someone like you, I'd do more than fall 
I just might crawl 

Seems like I get this feelin' this time of night 
Head down senses reeling, something just ain't right 
Imagination locked up inside and it's got nowhere to go 
I see my lover through anothers eyes 
And it's killing me to know the truth 
Like playing with fire To lose you  
I'd be a liar if I said... 

I ain't gonna crawl 
You ain't gonna nail my heart to the wall 
You ain't gonna find me crying like a child just asking for it
all 
I ain't gonna beg, I'd rather lose it all instead 
If that is what it takes to get you, Part of me just might let
you 
For someone like you, I'd do more than fall 
I just might crawl 

I ain't gonna crawl 
You ain't gonna nail my heart to the wall 
You ain't gonna find me crying like a child just asking for it
all 
I ain't gonna beg, I'd rather lose it all instead 
If that is what it takes to get you, Part of me just might let
you 
For someone like you, I'd do more than fall 
I just might crawl
