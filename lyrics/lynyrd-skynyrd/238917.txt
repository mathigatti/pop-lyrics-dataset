Well Billy Joe told me, said everything's lookin' fine 
He's got the place all secured, got the icebox full of wine 
He said hurry on over and don't be late 
He got three lovely ladies who just won't wait 
Do some down south jukin' 
And lookin' for a peace of mind 


Now put your Sunday pants on, lets get out on on the road 
We been workin' all week, and I'm thinkin' its time we let go 
I got three fine mamas sittin all alone, gonna sip our wine and
get it on 
And do some down south jukin' 
Lookin' for a peace of mind 

Now come Monday morn we'll be headin' out to the field 
And we'll be doin our thing for Papa and ol' Uncle Bill 
Lord, but then come Friday night we'll be headin to town 
Tryin' to pick up any woman hanging around 
And do some down south jukin' 
Lookin' for a peace of mind
