Since my baby left me, I found a new place to dwell
Down at the end of the lonely street at Heartbreak Hotel
I get so lonely baby, I get so lonely
I get so lonely I could die


Although the place is crowded
You still can find some room
Where those broken hearted lovers cry away their gloom

I get so lonely baby, I get so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

The bell hop's tears keep flowin'
The desk clerk's dressed in black
They been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back

I get so lonely baby, I get so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

I get so lonely baby, I get so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

I get so lonely, I get so lonely
