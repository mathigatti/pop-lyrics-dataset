Five a.m. in the mornin', whiskey still runnin' through my head 
I could get out of bed and maybe I'll just have another
cigarette 
As long as I can remember seems all I've ever done is work 
The boss is a jerk and I ain't payin' the rent 
Spent my whole life shovelin' dirt


(chorus) 
I'm gonna get outta Hell in my Dodge 
Can't take this anymore 
Gonna go downtown pick up my girl 
There ain't nothin' worth waitin' for 
Take the road less traveled 
Spend my life behind the wheel 
Gonna get outta Hell in my Dodge 
Freedom made out of steel

There's a knock on the door from the Sheriff 
Askin' me where I was last night 
Seems somebody lookin' a lot like me 
Had takin' up with his wife 
He said son if I ever catch him 
There's gonna be some hell to pay 
He'll be gone for good if I see him again 
'Cause I just might blow him away

(repeat chorus)

What's a poor man supposed to do 
Stuck in the middle and trapped by the blues 
Baby, I'm sick of these blues

(chorus) 
I'm gonna get outta Hell in my Dodge 
Can't take this anymore 
Gonna go downtown pick up my girl 
There ain't nothin' worth waitin' for 
Well I Don't care if I'm wrong or right 
Gotta split this town tonight 
Gonna get outta Hell in my Dodge 
Live my life behind the wheel 
I'm Gonna get outta Hell in my Dodge 
My freedom made out of steel
