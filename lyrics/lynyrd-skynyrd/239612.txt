Cheatin woman make you crazy 
Cheatin' woman make you a fool 
She'll leave your heart so lonely 
Brother there's nothin' you can do 
Well I can't stand the pain no more 
She don't want my love for sure 
She don't even want poor me 
Knockin' on her front door


Why did you make me love you sister 
When you knew you was untrue 
You loved every man with pants on 
Yes a dozen to you is too few 
I'm gonna shoot you and end your world 
Then you won't bother poor me 
You won't bother poor me no longer

Cheatin' woman -- gonna shoot ya

Oh woman why you do me 
Oh Lord the way you do 
I done everything I can baby 
Seems like nothin' reaches you 
I'm gonna get that pistol gal 
I'm gonna shoot you and all your pals 
You ain't gonna bother poor me 
You won't bother poor me no longer
