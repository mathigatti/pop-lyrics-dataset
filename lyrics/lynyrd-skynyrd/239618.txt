I hear the rumors flyin'
About a head on crash
At the stroke of midnight
When centuries clash
Some gonna party
Some gonna kneel and pray


Well you can quote the bible
Bribe the devil
But there's gonna be some hell to pay

We were young and innocent
Though this day would never come
And tomorrow seemes a million miles away

Let's look each other in the eyes
And realize it could be time
To set aside our anger
And know we're all the same

Take my hand
We're gonna cross the line
To a brand new day
Or the end of time

We're gonna rise as one
Or fall together
Out here on the ledge
We're standin' on the edge
Of forever

From the silence I hear the thunder role
Words of the prophets echo in my soul
One salvation in this world to me
I know in my heart if we love each other
We can face what's meant to be

Now there's power in the wrong hands
A madman in a foreign land
If we don't get our senses
It's all gonna slip away

Take my hand
We gonna cross the line
To a brand new day on the end of time
We're gonna rise as one and fall together
Our here on the ledge
Standin' on the edge
Of forever

Take my hand
We're gonna cross the line
To a brand new day on the end of time
We're gonna rise as one and fall together
Out here on the ledge
Standin' on the edge
Out here on the ledge
Dancin' on the edge forever
Oh, oh, forever, oh, forever
