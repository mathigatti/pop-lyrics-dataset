White Dove sittin' on a blackberry bush 
Is there any questioning why 
Tell me what heaven you're bound for today 
Feel just like I could cry 
Feel just like I could cry 


Little squirrel sitting on a ___ ___ rock 
Wodering where the winter meal is coming from 
Tired of fighting for it, gonna lay down my gun 
Just know that my work is done 
Just know that my work is done 

Little boy blue now come blow your horn 
No more of the sheep is around 
Said I'm tired of fighting, gonna lay down my gun 
Just know that my work is done 
Just know that my work is done 
Just know that my work is done 
Just know that my work is done
