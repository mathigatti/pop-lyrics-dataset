Mamma called this morning, said
'Son won't you come back home?
I ain't been feelin' good but
I know it won't be long.'
Don't keep me waiting
I wanna touch your face again
Ohh, what a good life it's been...


Now I'm ready to fly
I wanna see your daddy again
I'm ready to fly
All my family and friends
I know they're out there waiting
In a place beyond the sky
Ohh, I'm ready to fly

Hard times was '69
The war was raging on
That's the reason my daddy left
And never made it back home
It was tough for all of us
But mamma smiled everyday
Ohh, it's so hard to hear her say

Now I'm ready to fly
I wanna see your daddy again
I'm ready to fly
All my family and friends
I know they're out there waiting
In a place beyond the sky
So now I'm ready to fly

She made sure that we would never see her cry
But those tears on the pillow she couldn't hide

Now I'm ready to fly
I wanna see your daddy again
I'm ready to fly
All my family and friends
I know they're out there waiting
In a place beyond the sky...

Son, now I'm ready to fly
I wanna see your daddy again
I'm ready to fly fly fly
All my family and friends
I know they're out there waiting
In a place beyond the sky
I'm ready to fly.

I'm ready to fly

I'm ready to fly

I'm ready to fly

Fly, Fly, Fly.
