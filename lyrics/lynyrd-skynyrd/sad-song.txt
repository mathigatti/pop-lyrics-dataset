We can fight this all night long
There is no right, there is no wrong
Love ain’t easy, sometimes it is so blind
The things we said were not so kind


What you see is what you get
I ain’t that old, I’m not dead yet
All those words we said are in my head
Now all I got left, is this sad song

Something old and something new
Something borrowed, but now I’m blue
I stood against the world with you
But now I know baby our love is through

What you see is what you get
I ain’t that old, I’m not dead yet
All those words we said are in my head
Now all I got left, is this sad song

After all this time gone by
Now I sit here and wonder why
Yeah, I’m still here and baby you are gone
All I’ve got left, is this sad song
Sad, sad song

Oh, what you see is what you get
I ain’t that old, I’m not dead yet
All those words we said are in my head
Now all I got left, is this sad song
