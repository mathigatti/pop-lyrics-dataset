We don't have no plastic L.A. Friends
Ain't on the edge of no popular trend
Ain't never seen the inside of that magazine GQ
We don't care if you 're a lawyer, or a texas oil man
Or some waitress busting ass in some liquor stand
If you got Soul
We hang out with people just like you


My hair's turning white
My neck's always been red
My collar's still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Yes you could say
We've always been
Red, White, and Blue

Ride our own bikes To Sturgis
We pay our own dues
Smoking camels, drinking domestic brews
You want to know where I have been
Just look at my hands

Yeah, I've driven by the White House
Spent some time in jail
Momma cried but she still wouldn't pay my bail
I ain't been no angel
But even God, he understands

My hair's turning white
My neck's always been red
My collar's still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Yes you could say
We've always been
Red, White, and Blue

Yeah that's right!

My Daddy worked hard, and so have I
Paid our taxes and gave our lives
To serve this great country
So what are they complaining about

Yeah we love our families, we love our kids
You know it is love that makes us all so rich
That's where were at
If they don't like it they can just
Get the hell out!

Yeah!

My hair's turning white
My neck's always been red
My collar's still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Yes you could say
We've always been
Red, White, and Blue

Oh, oh, Red, White, and Blue

Red, White, and Blue

Red, White, and Blue
