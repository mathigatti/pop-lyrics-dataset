He was 5 foot 7
Strong as an Oak tree
Yeah he had a good reason for every lick he gave me
But he showed me the ropes, good whiskey and smoke
And how to tell a dirty joke


I had a good teacher
Half devil, half preacher
He made me a believer
I had a good teacher, teacher
Oh yeah!

She was 6 foot 1
Shakin' that money thing
I was high school dumb when I had my first tall one
But she gave me a sip and a kiss on the lips
She let me give her one more

I had a good teacher
Man, you shoulda seen her
She made me believe her
Oh Lord, I had a good teacher, teacher
Oh yeah!

These are my teachers!

I graduated from the school of hard knocks, yea!
Learned from the best all the tricks to get by
But I've got to give credit where the credit is due
I wasn't born no fool

I had a good teacher
A really good teacher

Oh! I had a good...
I had a good...

I had a good teacher
Half devil, half preacher
He made me a believer
Lord, I had a good teacher, teacher

She was my teacher
She was a really good teacher
She made me believer her
Lord, I had some good teachers
Some really good teachers!
