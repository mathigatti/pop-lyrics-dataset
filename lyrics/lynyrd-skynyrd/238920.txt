Well, just keep on runnin' mama, 'till you can't run no more 
You no your sister told your mama 'bout the boy next door 
Well, I see your sugar daddy comin' around the corner 
I wonder if he knows your the preacher's daughter, oh no


Well, I seen you through your window, baby, many times before 
Yeah there's a hundred different lovers knockin' on your back
door 
Well, I see your sugar daddy comin' around the corner 
I wonder if he knows your the preacher's daughter, oh no

Well, keep on runnin' mama, 'till you can't get no ? 
You're just a no good woman lord, I ain't lyin' 
Well, I see your sugar daddy comin' around the corner 
I wonder if he knows your the preacher's daughter, oh no

And I'm takin' about the preacher's daughter 
Doin' what she hadn't oughta 
Gettin' on down 
With every stud in town
