MMMMmmmmmm...
Hahaaa...
Let me tell you a story...


Outside of Macon off a country road
Justice was forsaken when they let the wrong man go
Johnny Law was shady first one on the scene
They called it murder in the first degree

Dead man walkin', walkin' down the hall
Judge says guilty but still he's standin' tall
Dead man walkin' they say he broke the law
Takin' the life of another man who done his daughter wrong

Light 'em up, lay 'em down
Take 'em out but there's more of us around
When wrong is right and right is wrong
Oh there's a dead man walkin' tonight
Walk on...
Walk on...
Walk on...

OOOOOOOOOoooo...

If I ask you a question, would you tell the truth
Would you pull the triger if you were standin' in his shoes
Dead man walkin' I know what I'd do
If someone hurt my baby I'd be walkin' too

Light 'em up, oh lay 'em down
Take 'em out but there's more of us around
When right is wrong and wrong is right
Oh there's a dead man walkin' tonight

Walk on...
You gotta walk on baby
Walk on...
Ooohh...
You gotta walk on baby
Walk on...

OOOOOoooooooo...

Yeah...
So if I ask you that question, would you tell the truth?
Ahaha...Dead man walkin'
MMMMMmmmmm...
