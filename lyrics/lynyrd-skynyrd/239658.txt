Why are you praying, my sweet morning dove?
You're so afraid, but so hungry for love
Well, I can give you love baby
Hugs and kisses, I can give you everything that you been missing


Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

She's twenty years old and a full grown woman
Sure enough
I'm the one that wants her
Are you ready for love?
Well I'm the one that wants you forever and a day
Come on baby, what'd you say
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

Sweet little missy
She's saving her love
But givin' us hope like the Lord up above
This ain't the worst thing she'll ever do
'Cause like a dollar bill, you can't take it with you

Well I'm the one that wants you forever and a day
Come on, baby, what'd you say?
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

She's so damn pretty, I can't take it no more
You and me, babe, giving my soul for sure
Well I can give you love, baby
Hugs and kisses, I can give you everything that you been missing

Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

Sweet little missy
She's saving her love
But givin' us hope like the Lord up above
This ain't the worst thing you'll ever do
'Cause like a dollar bill, you can't take it with you
