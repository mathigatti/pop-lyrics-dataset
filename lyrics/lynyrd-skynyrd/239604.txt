These ol' white lines on the highway 
Lord its all I know 
Seems like I've been out all my life 
But I just can't let it go 
Oh you know I ain't complainin' 
Cause I can tell, Lord its just your plan 
So I thank you for what I have 
And that's a song 
All I have is a song


I keep thinkin' about the friends I've had 
And all the meories we've shared 
They keep comin' back, time and time again 
Sometimes I wonder was it worth the cost 
And all I've lost 
Oh you know I ain't complainin' 
Cause I can tell, Lord its just your plan 
So I thank you for what I have 
And that's a song 
All I have is a song

So I play this song one more time, 'cause Lord its all I know 
I'll be standin' at your door following along 
'Cause all I have is a song 
And this song will live on 

All I have is a song 
A piece of me to live on
