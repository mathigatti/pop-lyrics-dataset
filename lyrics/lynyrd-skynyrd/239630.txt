Well, I'll tell you plainly baby
What I plan to do
Say I may be crazy woman
But I ain't no fool
Your daddy's rich, mama
You're overdue
I ain't the one, baby
Been messing with you
Got bells in your mind, lady
It is easy to see
I think it's time for me to move along
I do believe


You try to put a hook on me girl
Oh no!

Now you're talking jive, woman
When you say to me
Your daddy's gonna take us in baby
And take care of me
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby
'N take care of me
You know and I know, woman

I ain't the one
I never hurt you, sweet heart
I never pulled my gun
Got bells in your mind, baby
So won't you pardon me?
I think its time for me to move along
I do believe
Time for me to put my boots
Out in the street baby
Are you ready boots -- walk on

All right there missy
Let me tell you a thing or two
Now you're talking jive, woman
When you say to me
Your daddy's gonna take us in baby
And take care of me
When you know and I know, woman

I ain't the one
That ain't my idea - uh unh - of having fun
Got rings in your eyes lady
So won't you pardon me
I think its time for me to move along
I do believe
I must be in the middle
Of some kind of conspiracy
