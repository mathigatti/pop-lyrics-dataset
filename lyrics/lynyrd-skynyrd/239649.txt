How can you stand there smilin'
After all you've done?
You know it seems to make you happy
When you've hurt someone


Twice before you fooled me
With your deceivin' and lyin'
Come in and close the door
One more time, one more time

Yeah you've been gone so long
No one knows where
And you say that you still love me
Then show me you care
'Cause you got what it takes sweet mama
To make a man feel fine
So I'll take the word of a liar
One more time, one more time

Girl you've got me hungry
Losin' my mind
I know I'm playin' with fire
Get burned everytime
Yes I'm a fool for you baby
I can't deny
But I got to have your sweet love
One more time, one more time

Girl you've got me hungry
Losin' my mind
I know I'm playin' with fire
I get burned everytime
Yes I'm a fool for you mama I can't deny
But I got to have your sweet love
One more time, one more time

Yes I'm her fool once more
I can read her brown eyes
But when the rooster crows tomorrow
Well its her turn to cry
I'm headed down that old road
She lost her free ride
So tonight I'll take what I paid for
One more time, one more time
One more time
