Alarm clock rings about a quarter after five 
I've been up all night 
Raisin' hell with some friends of mine 
I take one good look in the mirror 
But only one things gettin' clearer 
The way I live, I'm lucky to be alive 


There I go lying to myself 
Said I wasn't gonna do it 
Next thing you know, here I go again 
Talked myself right into it 

Supposed to be to work an hour ago 
When I pass that boss stormin' down the road 
Now there's an angel on my shoulder 
thinnkin' she can win me over 
Devil's got my number don't you know 

There I go lying to myself 
Said I wasn't gonna do it 
Next thing you know, here I go again 
Talked myself right into it 

Maybe, maybe have I gone to far this time 
Maybe, maybe is my conscience workin' overtime 
Nah 

There's a knockout Georgia Peach givin' me the eye 
Well if the truth beknown I'm just a little shy 
Turns out she wasn't alone 
She had a six foot chaperone 
But that didn't slow me down 
Don't ask me why 

There I go lying to myself 
Said I wasn't gonna do it 
Next thing you know, here I go again 
Talked myself right into it 

I got no one to blame except myself 
I said I wasn't gonna do it 
Next thing you know here I go 
Talk myself right into it 
Talk myself, talk myself right into it 
Talk myself, talk myself, talk myself right into it 
Said I wasn't gonna do it 
Here I go again baby
