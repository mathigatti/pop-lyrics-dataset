You got to love ol' Charlie Daniels
You got to cut the rug with Wet Willie too
And you got to be a fan of the Marshall Tucker Band
Before I'll sit down and have a drink with you
Yes, Bakersfield has got ol' Merle Haggard
He's a bad, bad boy, yes indeed
Nashville's got a million and one guitar pickers
But I guess my favorite would be the CDB


(Chorus)
Yes there's a few good rockers in New York City
Guess the big LA, it never cared for me
So won't you tell all them Hollywierd writer people
That it just don't make a damn
When you got good friends like me

Never pick on good ol' Waylon Jennings
Or Willie Nelson, Bob Wills or me
Well they're playin' that good ol' country-western
You know this thing they call the Texas Swing

(Chorus)
