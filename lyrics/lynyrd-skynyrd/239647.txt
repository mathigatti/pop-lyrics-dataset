You better listen my brother 
'Cause if you do you can hear 
There are voices still callin' from across the years 
And they're cryin' across the ocean 
And they're cryin' across the land 
And they will until we all come to understand


(chorus) 
That none of us are free 
None of us are free 
None of us are free if one of us is chained 
None of us are free

Well there are people in the darkness 
And they just can't see the light 
And if we don't say it's wrong then that says it's right 
We got to feel for each other 
Let our brothers know we're here 
Got to get the message and send it out loud and clear 

That none of us are free 
None of us are free 
None of us are free if one of us is chained 
None of us are free 
Well it's the single truth 
We all need to see 
That none of are free if one of us is chained 
None of us are free


Well I swear to you salvation isn't very hard to find 
None of us can find it on our own 
We got to join together. Spirit, heart and mind 
All the are suffering, knows they're not alone

None of us are free 
None of us are free

If you just look around you 
You're see what I say 
'Cause the world's gettin' smaller each passin' day 
Now it's time to make some changes 
Now it's time all realized 
That the truth is shinin' right before our eyes


'Cause none of us are free 
None of us are free 
None of us are free if one of us is chained 
None of us are free


Well it's the very heart of humanity 
'Cause none of us are free if one of us is chained 
None of us are free

None of us, none of us 
None of us, none of us 
None of us, none of us are free

None of us, none of us 
None of us, none of us 
None of us, none of us are free


None of us are free 
None of us are free 
None of us are free if one of us is chained 
None of us are free 
'Cause it's the very truth 
We all need to see 
That none of us are free if one of us is chained 
None of us are free
