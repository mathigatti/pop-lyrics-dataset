Seven years of hardluck are comin down on me
From the Florida border yeah up to Nashville Tennessee
I worked in every joint you could name mister every honkytonk
along come mister yankee slicker and said "maybe you what i want


Want you to sign your contract
want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money workin for MCA

9000 dollars  just sow to the wind
Still we smiled at the yankee slicker with a big ole southern grin
They gonna take me out to california gonna make me a superstar
Just pay me all my money and maybe you won't get a star

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin for MCA
slickers steal my money since i was seventeen
If it aint no pencil pusher than it's got to be a honkytonk queen
Yeah

Every penny that i make I wanna see where my money goes

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin for MCA
