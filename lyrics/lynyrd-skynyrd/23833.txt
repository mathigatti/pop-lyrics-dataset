Whiskey bottles and brand new cars;
oak tree you're in my way.
There's too much coke and too much smoke
Look what's going on inside you.


CHORUS-
Ooh, ooh that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, ooh that smell
The smell of death surrounds you.

Yeah.
Angel of darkness is upon you.
Stuck a needle in your arm (you, fool, you)
So take another toke, have a blow for your nose,
one more drink, fool, would drown you. (hell, yeah)

CHORUS

Now they call you prince charming.
Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes.
Say you'll be alright come tomorrow, but
tomorrow might not be here for you. (yeah, you)

CHORUS

Aw, you, fool, you.
You stick them needles in your arm
I know I been there before.

One little problem that confronts you,
got a monkey on your back.
Just one more fix, Lord, might do the trick.
One hell of a price for you to get your kicks. (hell, yeah)

CHORUS 2x

Oh, you, fool, you
Don't stick those needles in your arm.
You're just a fool, just a fool, just a fool.
