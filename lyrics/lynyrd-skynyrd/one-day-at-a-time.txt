Angels sing and buzzards fly
Kingdoms fall and rivers rise
It's all the same since a sin is a lie
Some are free, but we're all doin' time


One day at a time
Smell the roses, taste the wine
One day at a time
No stop signs or red lights
That wheel keeps turnin'
On and on, day and night
No one survives
Ain't no use in cryin', what ain't dead is surely dyin'
One day at a time

Money burns and good gold shines
Dreamers dream and finders find
World keeps spinnin' round and round
Save our souls before it all comes down

One day at a time
Smell the roses, taste the wine
One day at a time
No stop signs or red lights
That wheel keeps turnin'
On and on, day and night
No one survives
Ain't no use in cryin', what ain't dead is surely dyin'
One day at a time

One day at a time
Smell the roses, taste the wine
One day at a time
No stop signs or red lights
That wheel keeps turnin'
On and on, day and night
No one survives
Ain't no use in cryin'
One day at a time

One day at a time
Smell the roses, taste the wine
One day at a time
No stop signs or red lights
That wheel keeps turnin'
On and on, day and night
No one survives
Ain't no use in cryin', what ain't dead is surely dyin'
One day at a time
