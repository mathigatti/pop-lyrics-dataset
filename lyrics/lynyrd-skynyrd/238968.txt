Every woman's out there lookin' for a rich man
And every man's out there looking for a perfect teen
Can't always get what you want sometimes
So your better off just takin' what you can


Money won't make you happy baby
And a perfect woman son's gonna make you sad
If you think that's where it's at, then I'm telling you, your
wrong
Cause you can have it all one day and then it's gone
You can search all of your life, and still not find
What you want, ain't what you've got

(Chorus)

Good lovin' so hard to find
Could this be the right place, at the right time
Good lovin', feels so fine
I just can't get enough
Cause good lovin's hard to find,so hard to find

We all need good lovin'
Ain't talkin' about no one night stand
Some have the touch, and others just a hand
But when you find the right one then you'll understand

Can't always get what you want sometimes
So you're better off just takin' what you can
You can search all of your life, and still not find
What you want ain't what you've got

(Chorus)

Good lovin' so hard to find
Could this be the right place at the right time
Good lovin' feels so fine
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
Some of that good good love
Some of that good good love
Some of that good, good love
Good lovin'
So hard to find
Good lovin'
Make you loose your mind
Good lovin'
Good good love
Good lovin'
Some of that lovin' baby
