I asked the wiseman one sunny day 
Can you help me find my way 
You're so much older and wiser too 
Would you help me mr wiseman 
I'm feelin' blue 
Oh I'm not satisfied


He said you're not doin too bad, not bad at all 
You're just trying to walk son before you can crawl 
You got stacks of money to sky up above 
Now all you need is to find you a love 

He sent me searchin' to find my love 
He sent me searchin' to the Lord up above 
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove 
And she'll tell you where to find your love 
Oh mr wiseman I need to find my love 

You can have anything in this god's world 
But you won't be happy son 'til you find a girl 
Now you can be happy boy if you try 
Find a woman boy, you'll be satisfied 

He sent me searchin' to find my love 
He sent me searchin' , I said Lord up above 
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove 
And she'll tell you where to find your love 

He sent me searchin' to find my love 
He sent me searchin' , I said Lord up above 
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove 
And she'll tell you where to find your love 

Oh Lord, he sent me searchin'
