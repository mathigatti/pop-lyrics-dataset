Two young lovers meet and take each others hand
They say I do in the name of the Lord
Livin' as one givin' all they can
Then the pressures come and a child is born
Young girl cradles the child in her arms
The man's home late and his day's too long
They're both unable to spend some time alone
That everybody needs to have
That's the thing that keeps love strong


Love don't always come easy
And sometimes love it can hurt
Words don't always come easy
It's worth a try we're gonna make it work
'Cause love don't always come easy

Without warning many go a different way
And travel that road lookin' for someone
Their lives unravel a little more every day
This ain't no time to turn and run
It's a crime to throw it all away

Love don't always come easy
And sometimes love it can hurt
Words don't always come easy
It's worth a try we're gonna make it work
'Cause love don't always come easy
