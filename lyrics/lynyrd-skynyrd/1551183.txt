Sometimes I want to light up underneath the no smoking sign
Sometimes I wished they'd tell me how justice got so blind
I wish they'd just leave me alone cause I'm doing alright
You can take your change on down the road and leave me here with mine


Cause that aint my America, that aint this country's roots
You want to slam ol Uncle Sam but I aint lettin you
I'm mad as hell and you know I still, bleed red white and blue
That aint us, That aint my America, That Aint My America

Yeah I was standing there in Dallas, waiting on a plane
I overheard an old man tell a young soldier thanks
Young soldier hung his head and said its hard to believe
You're the only one that took the time to say a word to me

And the old man said

That aint my America, that aint this country's roots
You want to slam ol Uncle Sam but I aint lettin you
Yeah I'm mad as hell and you know I still, bleed red white and blue
That aint us, That aint my America, That Aint My America

It's to the women and men in their hands they hold a bible and a gun
And they aint afraid of nothing when they're holding either one, oh, uhh
Now theres kids that cant pray in school, hundred dollar tanks of gas,
I can tell you right now this country aint, aint supposed to be like that

No, that aint my America, that aint this country's roots
You want to slam ol Uncle Sam but I aint lettin you
Yeah I'm mad as hell and you know I still, bleed red white and blue
That aint us, that aint my, that aint my America, oh no, That Aint My America
