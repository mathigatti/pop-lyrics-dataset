Well he walks so tall to be so small 
Never met a man who's stranger 
He lives his life for a dollar sign 
And to deal with him is dangerous 
He knocked me down but I'm on my feet 
Now I'm so much wiser 
I'd rather quit and go back home 
Than to deal with the money miser 
Let's cry for this bad man 
I sing a song for the bad man


Well, you treat me right baby, I'll treat you right 
That's the way its supposed to be 
I put my faith down in my friend 
And he almost put an end to me 
Well I work seven days a week 
Eight when I am able 
When you take money from me you take food from my mama's table 
Let's cry for this bad man 
I wrote a song for the bad man

Oh baby you know who you are 

Let's cry for this bad man 
I wrote a song for the bad man way down in Georgia

Well, you treat me right baby, I'll treat you right 
That's the way its supposed to be 
I put my faith down in my friend 
And he almost put an end to me 
Well, when you take my money baby when you hurt my family 
I go walkin' through the swamps without no shoes 
Step on a snake it scares you 
Let's cry for this bad man 
I wrote a song for the bad man BR&gt;Oh let's cry for this bad
man 
I wrote a song for the bad man

Oh baby straight to you 
He's so bad, so bad
