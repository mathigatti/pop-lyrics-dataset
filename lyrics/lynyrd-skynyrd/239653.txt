MMmmmmm... That's right
Yeah...


Big bad machine still makin' the scene
Big wheels keep on turnin'
Step on the gas, gone in a flash
Rubber just keeps on burnin'
'Cause every night is a Saturday night
No Matter what town we're in
Open the doors, kick out the lights
Just let the party begin

We're just watchin' the world from this big ass bus
The highway is home to folks like us
Makin good music, keepin' it alive
Slip in slip out, of your rockin little town tonight
Yeah that's what we do..

Get into town, lay our head down
Really ain't nothin' to do
Watchin' the clock, get ready to rock
We ain't no different than you

'Cause every night is a Saturday night
No Matter what town we're in
Open the doors, kick out the lights
Yeah let the party begin

We're just watchin' the world from this big ass bus
The highway is home to folks like us
Makin' good music, keepin' it alive
Slip in, slip out
Of your rockin' little town tonight

MMMMmmmmm...

So good to see you all again
I hope this ride we're on
Oooooh it never ends yeah...

OOohhh...

'Cause every night is a Saturday night
No Matter what town we're in
Open the doors Kick out the lights
Yeah let this party begin

"Cause We're just watchin' the world from this big ass bus
The highway is home to boys like us
Makin' good music, keepin' it alive
Slip in, slip out

Watchin' the world from this big ass bus
The highway is home to folks like us
Makin' good music, keepin' it alive
Slip in, slip out
Of your rockin' little town tonight
