It was a late night show in Georgia 
We were on the 'ol highway 
We know we've lost some friends 
And family on the way 
But you know we all feel better 
And it makes it worth our time 
To know our bus is rollin' towards 
That Mason-Dixon line


(chorus)

Oh we can't seem to find the end of the road 
Roots never grow on the seeds that we sow 
We've still got our music and so many miles to go 
You know we can't seem to find the end of the road

We know we've got a legacy that's hard to live up to 
But there's still a lot of reasons 
Why we play these songs for you 
It's a family tradition and as long as we're around 
That Freebird keeps on flyin' and it never will come down

(repeat chorus)

Oh we can't seem to find the end of the road 
Roots never grow on the seeds that we sow 
We can't seem to find the end of the road 
No matter how far we travel it always seems to slow 
We still got our music and so many miles to go 
You know we can't seem to find Lord the end of the road 
The end of the road
