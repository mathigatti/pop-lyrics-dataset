I heard the voice and saw the face
And I know he was there
The robe it floated around my bed
And I felt no pain


You can talk about the help you need
He's a friend indeed
Just open your heart and live again
And he'll set you free

Well, he took them away
All the troubles and the pain
Whoa, you can call me a fool
But I know he was there
Yes, I know he was there

The night I had, has long since gone
But the memories stay
And now Mr. Trouble when you come my way
I'm not too proud to pray

Yes, he took them away
All the troubles and the pain
Whoa, you can call me a fool
But I know he was there
Yes, I know he was there

Well, he took them away
All the troubles and the pain
Whoa, you can call me a fool
But I know he was there
Yes, I know he was there

The night I had, has long since gone
But the memories stay
And now Mr. Trouble when you come my way
I'm not too proud to pray
