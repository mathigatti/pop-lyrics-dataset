What the hell have we done, to get this far down
Yeah, take a look at us now
And what we’ve become
Seems like we’re takin’ care of everybody else
But we forgot our own
A soldier, a beggin’ man, yeah
Another homeless child


Give us somethin’ to live for
Somethin’ we can hold onto
Somethin’ to believe in
Like the love between me and you
Caught up in a game that I know we can win
To lose it all now, oh what a sin
I’ll keep my faith, no I’ll never change
Give us something to live for

Oh, give us somethin’ to live for

All of us took a left, when we shoulda gone right
Oh what happened to us brothers and sisters
Now all we do is fight
You’re face to face, and eye to eye
How do we mend this broken heart?

Give us somethin’ to live for
Somethin’ we can hold onto
Somethin’ to believe in
Like the love between me and you
Caught up in a game that I know we can win
To lose it all now, oh what a sin
I’ll keep my faith, no I’ll never change
Give us something to live for

We all need something to believe in
Ooohhh!

Goin’ down a dead end road
Like a freight train on the tracks
Lord we’re carrying a heavy load
Ohhh, and it’s about to break our backs

Give us somethin’ to live for
Somethin’ we can hold onto
Somethin’ to believe in
Like the love between me and you
Caught up in a game that I know we can win
To lose it all now, oh what a sin
I’ll keep my faith, no I’ll never change

Somethin’ to live for, hmmmmmm
Give me somethin’ to live for, ohhhhhhhhh
