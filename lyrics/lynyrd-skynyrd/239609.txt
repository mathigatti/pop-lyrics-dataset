There's an old man sittin' on a front porch now
Talkin' 'bout how it used to be
When I was young I was a hell of a man
My father died when I was ten
I hit the road to find a job
Had to feed my family
Times were hard my hands are still scarred
From the life I've had to lead
I was born to run


Drove a tractor and trailer all my life
Six kids and a hell of a wife
Made lots of money it all slipped away
A large family that's the price you pay
I always dreamed never gave up
Son, even when times got tough
That's when I'd push it a little bit more
You should've heard that engine roar

I was born to run
Can't slow down
No regrets, I've been blessed
Born to run
In time you'll see what the good Lord's done for me
Born to run
I can't slow down
No regrets, I did my best
Born to run
In time you'll see
What the good Lord's done, done for me

The old man, he passed away
And all he said never crossed my mind
Until I saw the price he payed
Was a lot like mine
I'm full and though it's miles away
Gotta hit the city right on time
And when I'm on I'll always sing little song of mine
I was born to run
