Yeah, she’s sittin’ at the table, lookin’ down at her drink
She’s always on time, I’m always runnin’ late
I was on my way, but I got sidetracked


Yeah, Gary called me up, said:Rickey’s in a jam'
Come on over brother, she’ll understand
Meet me at the truck, we got some plannin’ to do

I been bad, I been good
Don’t always do the things that I should
When I go, go all night
But when I do it wrong, woo
I do it up right

Yeah, me and the boys do it up right

I looked at my watch, it was a quarter to three
I knew she’d be up there waitin’ on me
I-I-I-I, got some explainin’ to do

I been bad, I been good
Don’t always do the things that I should
When I go, I go all night
But when I do it wrong, woo
I do it up right

So I headed straight home, I ain’t gonna lie
Ain’t got no excuses, no alibis
I said I was sorry, she said I’ve heard it before
So come on over here boy

I been bad, I been good
Don’t always do the things that I should
When I go, I go all night
But when I do it wrong, woo

I been bad, I been good
Don’t always do the things that I should
When I go, go all night
But when I do it wrong, woo
I do it up right

Baby, I do it up right
Oh, I’m gonna do it up right
Whoa yeah
Whoa, I do it up right
Me and the boys do it up right
Ooohh
