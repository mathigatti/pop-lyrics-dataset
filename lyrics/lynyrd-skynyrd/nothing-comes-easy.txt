Another hot cup of coffee
I’m up at 5 am
These old worn-out working boots
Look like these beat up hands
But I get up and I do it
Cause people depend on me
Trying to keep my faith
In this American dream
Paycheck’s going down
Prices are going up
Takes most of my money
Just to fuel my pickup truck


Nothin’ comes easy
Tryin’ to feed my family
Nothin’ comes easy
For a working class like me
I been doin’ time on the line
Mister, you don’t understand
Nothin’ comes easy

Let’s put back the pieces
To this broken promised land
All this crazy spending
I don’t understand
Politicians preachin’
But it don’t ever change
Same old lines and bullshit
Might as well flush it all down the drain
Nobody wants to say it
But I’m gonna speak my mind
We’re all in this together
But we’re runnin’ out of time

Nothin’ comes easy
Tryin’ to feed my family
Nothin’ comes easy
For a working class like me
I been doin’ time on the line
Mister, you don’t understand
Nothin’ comes easy

Not for a man like me

When your back’s up against the wall
And the wolf’s knockin’ at your door
Listen Mr. President
Cause we can’t take it anymore

Nothin’ comes easy
Tryin’ to feed my family
Nothin’ comes easy
For a working class like me
I been doin’ time on the line
Mister, you don’t understand
Nothin’ comes easy

It ain’t easy
For a working man like me
Nothin’ comes easy
Tryin’ to feed my family
But I’m out here doin’ it on the line
Mister, you don’t understand
Nothin’ comes easy
Easy, nothin’ comes easy
