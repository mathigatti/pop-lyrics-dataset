When the season is turning 
And my day has gone by 
And to see my reflection 
See it in your eyes 
Know the day that's come now has gone by 


And if you look now quite closely 
You feel the sun start to shine 
And you know the day is longing 
Longing just for you 
The season that's come now is as fresh as you 

And if you look now quite closely 
You feel the sun start to shine 
And you know the day is longing 
Longing just for you 
The season that's come now is as fresh as you
