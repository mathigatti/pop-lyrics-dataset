Little bit of Bakersfield 

I'm a honky tonk night time man 
I can't stand no light 
I'm a honky tonk night time man 
I can't stand no light 
I get my rest in the day time 
Do my runnin' around at night 


I had the blues this morning 
Had the blues all day today 
I had the blues this morning 
Had the blues all day today 
Well I wish a tornado 
Come and blow my blues away, away 
That's what I said, take 'em away 

Sounds like Roy 
Yeah 

And then my heart starts beatin' 
When that sun starts sinkin' low 
Well my heart starts beatin' 
When that sun starts sinkin' low 
When the shadows fall 
I know its time for me to go

Billy Powell on piano 

Oh Barry, play me some dobro 

I'm a honky tonk night time man 
I can't stand no light 
I'm a honky tonk night time man 
I can't stand no light 
I get my rest in the day time 
I do my runnin' around, round at night 
I get my rest in the day time 
Gets that old love sweet stuff at night
