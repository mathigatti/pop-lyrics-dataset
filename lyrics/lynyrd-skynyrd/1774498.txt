Mud-covered cornfields starin' out my back door
The barn's leaning over now and that deer don't run no more
So much life before, now that dream is gone


When the factory burned down I moved up to the city
The school we all went to is a memory that got bulldozed
And the good times froze when that door closed

Main Street's still there but the stores are all empty
The car lot where my daddy worked is dirt and stone
The only thing that comes through here
Is stormy weather
And it's raining...
It's raining in my heartland

We're packing them boxes for something better
Ran across my mom and dad's old love letters
And the photograph of this house that we're standin' in now

Let's stop by the church where we got married
Walk out back where your grandma's buried
And say goodbye one last time

Main Street's still there but the stores are all empty
The car lot where my daddy worked is dirt and stone
The only thing that comes through here
Is stormy weather
And it's raining...
It's raining in my heartland

Some dreams just stop growing where you plant them
You gotta count your blessings and be happy that you've had them
Let's grab a shovel baby - dig us a new life

Main Street's still there but the stores are all empty
The car lot where my daddy worked is dirt and stone
The only thing that comes through here
Is stormy weather
And it's raining...
It's raining in my heartland
Yeah, it's rainin'
It's raining in my heartland
Oh my heartland
Yeah my heartland
It's rainin'...
