I don't care who you are baby 
Don't care about all the friends that you know 
And why you chose me 
Lord, sweet mama don't want to know 
Can't tie me down baby 
Don't bring me down 
Chains can't hold me, I gotta go 


I don't want your money baby 
Don't care for your fancy clothes 
And how you people live together 
I say Lord in Heaven only knows 
Can't tie me down people 
Don't bring me down 
Oh the man can't stop me, I gotta go 
Gonna hit that road 
Buy me some coke 

You can take all your charm baby 
Yea sweet daddy knows where it goes 
Yes it does 
You can tell your big sister thanks alot for the hole 
Can't tie me down baby 
Don't bring me down 
Chains can't hold me, I gotta go 
Gonna hit that road 
I gotta go, don't hold me baby
