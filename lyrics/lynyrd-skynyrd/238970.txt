New York City is a thousand miles away 
And if you ask me, I'll tell you that's OK 
Now I'm not trying to put the big apple down 
'Cause they don't need a man like me in town 
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line 
Work hard all day tryin' to make a dime 
But that's allright, that's OK by me 
'Cause that's the way that it was meant to be


Big city, hard times don't bother me 
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

I don't like smoke chokin' up my air 
And some of those city folks well they don't care 
I don't like cars buzzing around 
I don't even want a piece of concrete in my town 
I like sunshine, fresh clean air 
Makes me feel like you wouldn't care but 
that's all right, each to his own 
But one smell from the city 
And this country boy is gone 
Big city, hard times don't bother me 
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

Well, I don't want to even read about it

Let me tell you something, let me tell you true 
What's right for me might not be right for you 
Well, you live your way, I'll live mine 
And I hope that your happy all the time 
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line 
Work hard all day tryin' to make a dime 
But that's all right, that's OK by me 
'Cause that's the way that it was supposed to be


Big city, hard times never bother me 
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

Let me tell ya, ... I said 
Big city, hard times never bother me 
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be 
Ooh, that's my way, baby 
I don't want you to even tell me about the big city 
I don't want to read about it...
