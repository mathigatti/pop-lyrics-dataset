Those misters dressed in blue never done so right by me 
Some of the times I was innocent but the judge said guilty 
I'm not one to complain now son I tell you true

Double trouble--that's what my friends all call me

With a temper as hot as fire 
Spent ninety days on a peat farm just doin' the county's time 
Well now, even mama said Son you're bad news 
And it won't be too long before someone puts one through you

(Chorus)

(Chorus)
