Let me tell ya...

Where I come from it's grits and gravy not champagne and caviar
Got pickup trucks, ain't no mercedes, that's who we are
[Oooooh..  Yeah I wouldn't change a thing]
I ain't no saint sometimes a sinner and I can't tell you why
But I get up every mornin' and thank the man above [Oooooh
WOOOoo my life is good]


Let me tell ya how good...  hahaaa

Like my women hot and my beer ice cold
A real fast car and my whiskey old
Like a slow drive down and old dirt road
That's How I like it
I like to turn my music way up loud
Ain't nothin' better than the sound of a crowd
American flag it makes me proud
That's how I like it

Wooooo...aaah... Listen now...

Ain't no cell phone towers, you won't catch me online
Workin' with my hands for hours, is how I spend my time
And I don't stand in line for coffee, It ain't my cup of tea
Out here in the country we got everything we need Ooooh Woooo
yeah..

Like my women hot and my beer ice cold
A real fast car and my whiskey old
Like a slow drive down and old dirt road
That's How I like it
I like to turn my music way up loud
Ain't nothin' better than the sound of a crowd
American flag it makes me proud
That's how I like it yeah..

Ooooohhhh...

WOOooooo That's how I like it

[Whistle]

Like my women hot and my beer ice cold
A real fast car and my whiskey old
Like a slow drive down and old dirt road
That's How I like it
I like to turn my music way up loud
Ain't nothin' better than a Skynyrd crowd
American flag it makes me proud
That's how I like it yeah...
That's how I like it
That's how I like it

WOOOOOoooo  

Yeah....
