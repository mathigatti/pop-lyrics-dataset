Oh, she's on the left, I'm on the right
Oh, here comes trouble
And I ain't even seen her yet
Oh, she's something I'll regret


She's got it good, I got it bad
Can't seem to get her walk
And her talk outta my head
Oh, you know I'm just a mess

Give it up, give it up
Give it to me
Can't you see honey
I'm down on my knees

Wanna feel your touch
I need you so much
Don't you know I come with
A money back guarantee
(Oh, you ain't gonna get my money)

I'll buy the house
You drive my car
I'll take you anywhere
But baby if that's not enough

Oh, you can call my bluff
I will shower you
With diamonds and rings
I'll feel a little angel baby can't you see

Wanna feel your touch
I need you so much
Don't you know I come with
A money back guarantee
(Oh, you can have it all baby
Here it comes, here it comes)

Give it up, give it up
Give it to me
Can't you see honey
I'm down on my knees

Wanna feel your touch
I need you so much
Don't you know I come with
A money back guarantee
(Oh, you ain't gonna get my money)

Money back, money back guarantee
Money back, money back guarantee
Money back, money back guarantee
Money back, money back guarantee

Money back, money back guarantee
Yeah, yeah, oh the girl I see
Oh, you can have it all baby
Say baby, money back guarantee
Oh, you can keep your money back guarantee
