It's been so long since I've been gone
Another day might be too long for me
Traveling around I've had my fill
Of broken dreams and dirty deals


A concrete jungle surrounding me
Many nights I've slept out in the streets
I paid my dues and I changed my style
Seen hard times. All over now

I want to come home
It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love to stay

I miss old friends that I once had
Times ain't changed and I'll be glad when I go home
I don't know why the thought came to me
But why I'm here I really can't see. And now...

I want to come home
It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love to stay

Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love, mama
I've seen better days

I miss old friends that I once had
Times ain't changed and I'll be glad when I go home
I don't know why the thought came to me
But why I'm here I really can't see. And now...

I want to come home
It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love to stay

Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love, mama
I've seen better days
