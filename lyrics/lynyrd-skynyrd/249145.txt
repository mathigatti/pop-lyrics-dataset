[SPM] - 
South Park from the heart jump start 
The game everybody in my hood selling 
Crack cocane


[Hook]
On my block everything goes (goes)
Diamond rings on my pinky toes (toes)
Candy paint on my Cadillac (lac)
Who the fuck wanna battle rap (rap)
Believe me you don't have a chance (chance)
I come down like an avalanche (lanche)

[SPM] - [Verse 1] 
Load the pieces widreeses watch out lo que me dices
I'm on the mic and Jaime's on the Alecis Dickie Crieses
Fucked all your nieces I eaten up for breakfast 
They taste so delicious smoke fill rooms popping mushrooms 
I feel like I'm inna mutherfucking cartoon sipping on Red Rum 
You should join us a million haters and they still can't destroy
us
On the mic I'm known to get it started cold hearted and half ass
retarded 
Dearly departed and those who god guarded 
The young and the lost is who I'm trying to target 
The Sergeant's narcotic's division is crocked 
They found my bloody money and the mutherfucker's took it
Whoop this nigga and book this nigga 
And they wonda why i such a Ruthless nigga
You can act like you can't hear me
I know your listening 
I hear you talking out the pot that your pissing in 
Street specialist respect my intelligence
I got gats that's made to drop elephants

[Hook]
On my block anything goes (goes)
Diamond rings on my pinky toes (toes)

Who the fuck wanna battle rap (rap)

On my block anything goes (goes)
Diamond rings on my pinky toes (toes)
Believe me you don't have a chance (chance)

[SPM] - [Verse 2]
20 ounce Mountain Dew mix it with a 2 
With my nephew smoking Pepe Le Pew 
Talking about a dude we don't think is groovy 
I'm gonna put him to bed like Sleeping Beauty  
I told you once and I'll tell ya twice 
But I'm not gonna say this three or four times 
You boys wanna play we don't runaway
Got damn i forgot what i was going to say 
Something about 45's and Mac 11's 
Desert Eagles and A K 47's 
Slice your throat just like a goat
You boys can't see me with a microscope 
Kick down your door and found your Snow 
Smoking tough cause you hada fucking pound of Dro 
After I jack all the birds in the kitchen 
I hit the butt naked-n-go feed the pigeons 

[Hook]
On my block anything goes (goes)
Diamond rings on my pinky toes (toes)

Who the fuck wanna battle rap (rap)

[SPM] - [Verse 3]
Crack hotels digital scales 
Platinum necklas laced on Rockells 
Shine my jew-els buff my toe nails 
Who kisses and tells beez who seez hell
Smoke like rasta watch the imposta
Who's at my door a fucking cookie monsta
Hasta la vista bon a patista
12 gauge shotie make your chest look like pizza
Call me Flintstone; Land of Bedrock
I bought 2 clubs and a fucking restaurant 
Take a journey where the boys die early
45 underneath a niggas rocket jersey
Turn the table buck shot be fatal 
Pigs hand cuffing my wrist to my ankle
Mira muchacha's it's all about the Raza
Burn my finger try to smoke a cucaracha
They prejudice that's why they don't play mexicans
I get my dick sucked by my new receptionist
I started out with 100 tapes 
If you wasn't down then get the fuck out my face

[Hook]
On my block anything goes (goes)
