I'm just a city boy
But there's a small town side to me
And I feel it closin' in
Are we too blind to see
That she's dying more each day
And she's cryin' out to you and me


Chances come and when they're gone
They curse the fools who wait too long

So let's take care of what we have
Before the good we know goes bad
And the beauty fades and just slips away
The dirty air, they dying seas
Will this be the world we leave
To the wild and young
I say, just look at what we've done
And right before our yes
Today's yesterday
Could be tomorrow's goodbye

Here comes the rain
And it might wash her tears away
But it doesn't change a thing
Like my brother before me
All I can do is write this song
And for her I sing

Chances come and when they're gone
They carve in stone what we've done wrong

So let's take care of what we have
Before the good we know goes bad
And the beauty fades and slips away
The dirty air, the dying seas
Will this be the world we leave
To the wild and young
I say, just look at what we've done
And right before our eyes
Today's yesterday
Could be tomorrow's goodbye

Do you ever think about
The future or the past
Do you ever wonder
How long this world will last

Let's take care of what we have
Before the good we know goes bad
And the beauty fades, and just slips away
The dirty air, the dying seas
Will this be the world we leave
To the wild and young
I said, just look at what we've done
And right before our eyes
Yeah, it's right before our eyes

Today's yesterday
Could be tomorrow's goodbye
