There's a story to tell about days of old 
A man and his gun, a street fighter I'm told 
There's one in every town, tryin' to make himself a name 
If he's quicker on the draw, comes glory and fame


They say he's always alone, he rides a horse with no name 
His only friend was the devil by his side but it caused him so
much pain 
If his guns could talk, oh, the stories they would tell 
Of all the men who tried and lost, all the ones he sent to hell

(chorus) 
They are outlaws, renegades, rebels on the run 
They pay the price every day they live like the wrong end of a
gun 
Move around from town to town can't stay in any place to long 
Outlaws, renegades... rebels on the run

Things haven't changed much these days 
Faces are younger, but still they keep playing the deadliest
game

Brothers and sisters, what are we fightin' for 
It's not for the fame or the glory anymore 
I hear the mothers cryin' 
Too many children dyin' 
How many tears have to fall to bring this to an end

They are outlaws, renegades, rebels on the run 
They pay the price every day they live like the wrong end of a
gun 
Move around from town to town can't stay in any place to long 
Outlaws, renegades... Oh 
They're all outlaws, renegades, rebels on the run 
They pay the price every day they live like the wrong end of a
gun 
Move around from town to town can't stay in any place to long 
Outlaws, renegades... rebels on the run
