This old town ain't been the same
Since this old boys been gone
Lord I still got some good friends
But I feel so all alone
All I hear is disco
See pretty boys with high heels on


Well some people sure hate me
An the police dog me round
Well the only place I'm welcome
Is on the west side of town
Lord I'm on there wanted posters
I cant show my face in town

Play this one for south side

Jacksonville I love you
But you dont want me around
Jacksonville you raised me
An this is where I got my sound
Although I'm your outlaw
I still love my hometown
All around

Ahh this is for the west side boys

This old town ain't been the same
Since your native sons been gone
Lord I still got some old friends
But I am so all alone
All I hear is the disco
See pretty boys with high heels on
Well you can keep your disco
Pretty boys with high heels on
