I was born a travellin' man, that's all I'll ever be
Moving around from town to town its what makes me so free
My father was a trucker for the years since '23
On the day that I was born his blood was left for me
I'm a travellin' man
Travellin' Man -- that's what I am
Travellin' Man
Travellin' Man
That's what I am
Travellin' man -- that's what I am
No one puts a hold on me
You'll see me once or maybe twice
That's all you'll see of me
All you pretty women Lord, I hope you understand
Don't be a fool and fall in love with a travellin' man
I'm a travellin' man
Travellin' Man -- that's what I am
Travellin' Man
Travellin' Man
That's what I am
Travellin' man -- that's what I am
But at least I'm free
Travellin' man
Oh that's what I am
Travellin man -- that's what I am, Lord I move so fast
I have had so many women, none of them have lasted
---

Travellin' Man -- that's what I am
Travellin' Man
Travellin' Man
