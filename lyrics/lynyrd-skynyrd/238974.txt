"Well when I was a young-un they used to teach me to play
Music like this here..."


When I look in your face baby
When I look in your eyes
I can tell pretty mama I been wastin' time
'Cause you don't really love me
You just love me for what I am
But you best treat me right, woman
Gonna lose your money man

Well when I first met you baby, you was a red light girl
But I tried to take you to better world
But you would not listen
Still you think I am a fool
Well you had it made in the shade, baby
Don't let that tree fall down on you

Well I work the railroad each and every day
Well I work real hard tryin' to make my pay
Lord I never tell you what you supposed to say
Girl you had it made in the shade
Don't let that tree fall down on you
