I'm the kind of man that loves all the girls 
From debutantes to honky-tonk queens 
I've tasted every brand all around the world 
But all I see are peaches in my dreams 
I'm talkin' 'bout, I'm talkin' 'bout them southern women 
It's a well known fact across the Dixie line 
And if a man don't agree I can tell you he's blind 
They can drink with the best and the hell with the rest 
And if she takes you home you ain't gettin' no rest


(chorus)
I'm talkin' 'bout, I'm talkin' 'bout them southern women 
I'm talkin' 'bout they'll love you so slow them southern women 
Them southern girls 
They look like angels on saturday night oh-lord they got a wild
side 
Take you places that you've never been make a man come back
again 
Talk about mama's southern belle little girl learned her lesson
well 
Ain't no others can cast a spell like the sweet southern women

(repeat chorus)

They can make a man feel so proud they can capture him with a
southern style 
Little girl learned her lesson well ain't no others can cast a
spell 
Like the sweet southern women them southern girls
