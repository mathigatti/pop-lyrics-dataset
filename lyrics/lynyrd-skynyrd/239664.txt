There's a grey horse standin' still
As a soldier climbs in the saddle for one last ride
As the rain pours off his hat
You can see the shadows of the past written in his eyes


Now the cannons are silent
His friends are all gone
Gotta put it all behind him
If he ever wants to find his way home
He's the last rebel on the road

Just a boy with his old guitar
Keeps to himself but everybody takes him wrong
But he carries on
Got a dream that will never die
Can't change him, no use in stayin' where you don't belong

Now he's rollin' down the highway
Gone too far too fast
No one will ever find him, he'll never look back

'Cause he's the last rebel
And he's all alone
He's the last rebel
His friends are all gone
He's the last rebel
The last rebel on the road

There'll never be another like him
He's the last of a dying breed
Ain't no use in tryin' to tame him
'Cause he's the last rebel
