Ain't no reason why i should feel this way
I got everything going for now
Might have it all, some people say


But each time i think of your smiling face
For i took upon inside now
In your sweet love i can take

'cause i lost the best thing
I miss you more everyday
And i know deep inside me
No one can take your place, oh no

Sometimes when i am lonely
And i can feel your presence near
Well, i look at your picture
And your sweet voice i can often hear

But every time i really see you
Oh, my heart often smiles
And at that precise moment
I break up all inside

'cause i lost the best thing
I miss you more everyday
And i know deep inside me
No one can take your place, oh no

Oh, all alone, i've lost you
T'was nothing you could do
I lost my only creation
And now i'm paying all the due

But every time i really see you
Oh, my heart often smiles
And at that precise moment
I break up all inside

'cause i lost the best thing
I miss you more everyday
And i know deep inside me
No one can take your place, oh no
