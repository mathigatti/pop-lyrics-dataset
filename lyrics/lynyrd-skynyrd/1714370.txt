Well, it looks like it's another
Skynard family Christmas time
Well, well, well, well


Seems like [Incomprehensible] New Year's Day
Started out in old L.A
Those big wheels keep turnin' once again

But this bus we ride, we call our home
Well, this what keeps us movin' on
But 11 months on this road, I'm goin' home

Family say they're trimmin' the tree
Cookin' that turkey, waitin' on me
Just like Santa, I'll be right on time

Thirty eight will be there too
CDB will be guidin' you
To another Christmas time

Sleigh bells ringin', children singin'
It's another Skynard family Christmas time

Oh, pick an excuse
That's right, dig deep

Christmas time

Sleigh bells ringin', children singin'
It's another Skynard family Christmas time
Sleigh bells ringin', children singin'
It's another Skynard family Christmas time

Well, it's another Skynard family Christmas time
Yeah, it's another Skynard family Christmas time
That's right

It's another Skynard family Christmas time
