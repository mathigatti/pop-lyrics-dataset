There was a time that you believed
That nothing could happen to you
You were in a place - deep in a hole
So dark that you could not see


Everyday the rain won't fall
The sun will come out and shine on us all
There's a light at the end for you my friend
Oh, take it from me...
The Storm will someday end
Will someday end

So much has changed inside your heart
We can tell it's tearin' you apart
We share your pain and feel your hurt
But holy water cleanses the dirt

Everyday the rain won't fall
The sun will come out and shine on us all
There's a light at the end for you my friend
Oh, take it from me...
The Storm will someday end

Yeah
You were
Stuck in a hole

Everyday the rain won't fall
The sun will come out and shine on us all
There's a light at the end for you my friend
Oh, take it from me...
Everyday the rain won't fall
The sun will come out and shine on us all
There's a light at the end for you my friend
Oh, take it from me...
The Storm will someday end
It's gonna end
It's gotta end!
