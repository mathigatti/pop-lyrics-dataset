I remember the day that he came in
I can't believe how long it's been
Like a poet, he began to play
Just an old friend that hung with the band
A drinkin' man he had no plan
But he played the 'Bird...
Played it for free


'Cause I know he's here
He's everywhere
Take a look around oh and you will see
That cross we bear
It's in the air
Lord we thank you for these gifted hands

There are demons we live with every day
That tear at our hearts and take us away
To another place
Some of us don't get back
This song is for the hands of the workin' man
Who believes in himself and he understands
Love, hope, and faith are The Maker's plan

'Cause I know he's here
He's everywhere
Take a look around oh and you will see
That cross we bear
It's in the air
Lord we thank you for these gifted hands

One day we'll all take that ride
And with those gifted hands I know you'll fly
