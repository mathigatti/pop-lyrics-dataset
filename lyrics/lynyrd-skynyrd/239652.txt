You know I'm dirty because it's in me
Life's not easy
And it's the heart that I won't change
I wouldn't be the same


You see me one day and then the next day
I don't wanna play
I'm not the same dog you have known
It's not written in stone

Well am I right or wrong
Lookin' out for number one
I never stay too long
I'm there and then I'm gone

I'm not the preacher man
Oh can you understand
It's a game of win or lose
I've got and evil eye
You know sometimes I might lie
Oh, I'm not the preacher man
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Saint was a sinner
Ain't he a winner?
And did you hear him say
I didn't lie just as well
It's all in the head

Oh, ain't it funny
How little money
Cheap talkin' honey
Can turn a sunny day to gray
Well, we all got to pay

Oh, am I right or wrong
Lookin' out for number one
I never stay too long
I'm there and then I'm gone

I'm not the preacher man
Oh, can you understand
It's a game of win or lose
I've got an evil eye
You know, sometimes I might lie
Oh, I'm not the preacher man

I'm not the preacher man
Oh, can you understand
It's a game of win or lose
I got an evil eye
You know sometimes I might lie
Oh, I'm not the preacher man

I'm not the preacher man (2x)
I got an evil eye
You know sometimes I might lie
Oh, I'm not the preacher man

(3x)
I'm not the preacher man
