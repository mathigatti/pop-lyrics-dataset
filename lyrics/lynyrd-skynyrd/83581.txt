Well this life that I've lead has took me everywhere
There ain't no place I ain't never gone
But its kind of like the saying that you heard so many times
Well there just ain't no place like home
Did you ever see a she-gator protect her young
Or a fish in a river swimming free
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee


And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
'Cause I can see the concrete slowly creepin'
Lord take me and mine before that comes

Do you like to see a mountain stream a-flowin'
Do you like to see a youngun with his dog
Did you ever stop to think about, well, the air your breathin'
Well you better listen to my song

And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
'Cause I can see the concrete slowly creepin'
Lord take me and mine before that comes

I'm not tryin' to put down no big cities
But the things they write about us is just a bore
Well you can take a boy out of ol' Dixieland
But you'll never take ol' Dixie from a boy

And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
'Cause I can see the concrete slowly creepin'
Lord take me and mine before that comes

'Cause I can see the concrete slowly creepin'
Lord take me and mine before that comes
