Woman, I have to leave you 
I can't stay where there is no pay 
And I really don't care where I'm going to 
Its been so long since I've been gone 
Lord, I'm tired and I want to go home 
My throat is raw from singing the blues 
Need all my friends to talk to 
Now yes I do need all my friends to talk to 


Gonna search around til I find a friend 
Who believes in me for what I am 
Sing my song til it hurts 
Play my music til I hit pay dirt 
Now I got to sing my song 
I got to play my music, do the things I love 

Its been so long since I've been gone 
Lord, I'm tired and I want to go home 
My throat is raw from singing the blues 
Need all my friends to talk to 
Now yes I do need all my friends to talk to
