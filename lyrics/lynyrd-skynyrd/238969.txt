Getting work ain't easy in the hills of Tennessee
But things are bad all over my friends keep telling me
Even though I grew up there and never thought I'd leave
Had too many bills to pay, seven mouths to feed
Movin' to the city was all that I could do
Got them hillbilly blues


People here won't say goodmorning, they won't even take the time

I guess I know just how it feels to have something on your mind
So all I want is to go back home and fish in a mountain stream
This ol' life I'm living, Lord, you know it ain't for me
They say the sun it shines out here, but all I see is rain
Got them hillbilly blues
Got them hillbilly blues

All I want is to go back home and fish in a mountain stream
This ol' life I'm living, Lord, you know it ain't for me
They say the sun it shines out here, but all I see is rain
Got them hillbilly blues
Hillbilly blues
Hillbilly blues
