Dig down and tell me what you find
Back in the pages left behind
Everybody's got a story
Ours ain't no different from the rest
Each step we take, it's just a test


On this broken road to glory
When we were young and brave
We fought to save the one thing that we loved
We took the scared vow
And signed our names in blood

And through it all, we kept on shining
We fought the doubt and faced the pain
We built it up from dust and ashes
To cheat the odds and rise again

There's been a million miles of road
Another million miles to go
Still giving me a reason
Most times your first could be your last
God give me one more second chance

Oh, something to believe in
Though it's easier to give it up
Then to give it all you got
Don't let it make you something
That you're not

And through it all, we kept on shining
We fought the doubt and faced the pain
We built it up from dust and ashes
To cheat the odds and rise again
And through it all the wheels kept turning

Above the tears the truth stands tall, yeah
Here we are, one in spirit
We stand together through it all
Oh, through it all

When we were young and brave
We fought to save the one thing that we loved
We took the scared vow
And signed our names in blood

And through it all, we kept on shining
We fought the doubt and faced the pain
We built it up from dust and ashes
To cheat the odds and rise again

And through it all 
The wheels kept turning
Above the tears the truth stands tall, yeah
Here we are, one in spirit

We stand together through it all
Oh, through it all
The wheels keep turning, through it all
Oh, through it all
