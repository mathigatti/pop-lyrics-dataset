I jumped off a boxcar down around Tennessee 
I was cold tired and dirty hungry as I could be 
But I had my guitar and a hundred railroad songs 
So I asked the policeman 
Can I stay here long 
He said Mr. Hobo you got to go now 
We don't want you around 
See I'm trying to build a respectable town 
And we don't need a hobo like you around


So I left that town, Lord with my guitar in my hand 
Still cold and tired, kinda mad at the man 
But this life that I chose to live, sometime's strange 
See I'm trying to learn about the old music from ridin' the
train 
I'm a hobo I know, but thta's the price I pay 
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way 
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say 
Mr Choo-choo train take me away

I'm goin' to ride this train Lord until I find out 
What Jimmie Rogers and the Hag was all about 
See I play this rock n roll and I think that's fine 
But I wnta to go back a little further in time 
I'm a hobo I know but that's the price I pay 
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way 
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say 
Mr Choo-choo train take me away
