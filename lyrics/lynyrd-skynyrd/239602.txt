Ain't no good life 
Not the one that I lead 
'Cause the more I fight the sadness, yeah 
It only seems the more that I grieve 
Well I look back on the good times 
As some lost part of me 
I wanna know, tell me why is it so 
Well just because I don't pray 
Lord, that don't mean I ain't forgiven 
Just 'cause I'm alive 
That don't mean I'm makin' a livin' 


I'm gonna get myself together 
I'm gonna try a dyin' attempt 
Talkin' about the good times slippin' by 
Yeah I tell ya 
I don't even know where last month went 
Well I can't make no money baby 
Well 'cause my money's already spent 
And I know where it went 
I said it went on that damn rent 
Well I don't mean change, baby 
I mean foldin' money 
Well I want lovin', said I don't need a buddy 
I don't need nobody, now 

Ain't exactly my idea 
Its sort of old, borrowed and blue 
Just tryin' to say 
Don't try that straight life buddy 
Oh you'll find it kind of hard on you 
Women, don't try to cook nothin' up, ooh 
Brother you know you'll only wind up in your own stew 
Just don't let nobody tell you, oh what you oughta do
