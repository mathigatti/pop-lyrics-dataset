When I was 15 I dreamed of leaving my home
I had to see the world
And live like a rolling stone
I heard California was paved in gold
So I hopped on that train
It didn't come easy
But I keep thinkin' bout
The green grass and missing my home


Take me back to my southern ways
Where I can be myself and live another day
Take me back to my southern ways
Where the tall pines blow and the southern winds kiss my face

Oh southern grace

Me and my boys started a band
Practiced everyday out on the Hell House land
Played every honky tonk and this ol' bar
To sing about Sweet 'Bama
We were just simple men
The music is forever
and the songs will never ever end

Take me back to my southern ways
Where I can be myself and live another day
Take me back to my southern ways
Where the tall pines blow and the southern winds kiss my face

Oh take me back!

I sit here thinkin' about those days
I wouldn't change a thing about my life today
Ain't it funny how time sure flies
'Cause all I ever wanted and all I ever needed
WAS YOU

Take me back to my southern ways
Where I can be myself and live another day
Take me back to my southern ways
Where the tall pines blow and the St. John's flows, and only God - he

knows, and those southern winds kiss my face
