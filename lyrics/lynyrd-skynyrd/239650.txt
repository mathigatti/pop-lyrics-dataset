I met the man, when I was fifteen 
Seen him in all the papers, on T.V. and magazines 
So I had to ask him, what's the difference between 
Those who make a wish, those who spin wheels 
And those who ride in white limosines like you,mister 
Won't you tell me one thing


Some have the passion and they control the ride 
Some settle for whatever happens 
As years pass they see their lives just slip on by 
The world keeps a' turnin' 
It'll leave you behind 
Nothin' else matters, nothin's worth learnin' 
Until the dream you have inside

(chorus) 
It's the one thing, the one thing there's no denyin' 
So find yourself a dream and some piece of mind 
'Cause money and power won't buy it 
It's the one thing, nothin' else matters

And somewhere you might have heard the good times are through 
And good luck is somethin' you're born with 
I know it just ain't true 
The world keeps a' turnin' 
I wouldn't tell you no lie 
Nothin' else matters, nothin's worth learnin' 
Until the dream that you have inside

(repeat chorus)

Nothin' else matters
