There ain't no poor man
Born with a silver spoon
And there ain't no wise man
Who learned it all in school


A politician's promise
Can make you feel like a fool
But when they get the power
They're the first to break the golden rule

We work that 40 acres like riders on a mule

Climb that mountain
Reach the sky
Hangin' on for a good laugh
For a piece of that American pie
Hey nothin's easy
Nothin's for free
In the world of dog eat dog
Oh people, that's a poor man's dream

Hey Mr. walton
Lend me a dime
You know I'll repay ya
But it's gonna take me some time

I'm standing at the crossroads
Just about to roll the dice
I got a dream in my heart
Whatever it takes
I know I gotta pay the price

We work that 40 acres like riders on a mule

Climb that mountain
Reach the sky
Hangin' on for a good laugh
For a piece of that American pie
Hey nothin's easy
Nothin's for free
In the world of dog eat dog
Oh people, that's a poor man's dream

We work that 40 acres like riders on a mule

Climb that mountain
Reach the sky
Hangin' on for a good laugh
For a piece of that American pie
Hey nothin's easy
Nothin's for free
In the world of dog eat dog
Oh people, that's a poor man's dream

Hey nothin's easy
Nothin's for free
In the world of dog eat dog
Oh people, that's a poor man's dream

Oh... It's a poor man's dream
