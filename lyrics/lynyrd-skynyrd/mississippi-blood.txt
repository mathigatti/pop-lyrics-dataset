JVZ: She's got Mississippi Blood runnin' through her veins
Her mama was a hooker from New Orleans.
RM: Daddy walk hard with a gun in his boot
Blow you away, click bang boom boom.


JVZ: Good ole dude said she broke his heart.
Threw it on the ground,
stomped it hard.
RM: But I wanna little taste of my own
Before they be carving my name in stone.

Both: Oooh
JVZ: She's a dirty little thing, crazy as hell.
Both: Oooh Oooh
RM: She's my rock-n'-roll queen, sweet Southern bell.
BOTH: Oooh Oooh
JVZ: She's a lipstick stain on a burnt cigarette.
BOTH: Oooh Oooh
JVZ: Like an old blues song, stuck in my head
Mississippi mud and I'm sinking in, aw yeah.

BOTH: Oooh Oooh
BOTH: Oooh Oooh

BOTH: Cut-off jeans, tight t-shirt
Drinkin' from the bottle, rollin' in the dirt
Foot on the gas, El Camino
Ridin' with the king on the radio.

BOTH: Oooh Oooh
RM: She's a dirty little thing, crazy as hell.
BOTH: Oooh Oooh
JVZ: She's my rock-n'-roll queen, sweet Southern bell.
BOTH: Oooh Oooh
BOTH: She's a lipstick stain on a burnt cigarette.
BOTH: Oooh Oooh
BOTH: Like an old blues song, stuck in my head
Mississippi mud and I'm sinking in.
She reads from the good book just to be bad.
Lyin' in the hay - she likes to move fast.
Like an old blues song stuck in my head
It's worth all the pain that i'm gonna get.

BOTH:
Oooh Oooh
She's a dirty little thing, crazy as hell.
Oooh Oooh
She's my rock-n'-roll queen, sweet Southern bell.
Oooh Oooh
She's a lipstick stain on a burnt cigarette.
Oooh Oooh
Like an old blues song, stuck in my head.
JVZ: Mississippi mud and I'm sinking in.
