Well sometimes I lose my direction
And sometimes I jump off track
But when I ride out baby, I can always get back
I need to feel the cool breeze in my face
The rumble of the engines between my legs
Hey little sister, You can color me gone
So if I want to stay out all night long
You can't stop me from running wild
Yeah don't worry how long I'm gone
I'll come back every once and a while


I pick 'em up, I lay 'em all down
I never like my feet, to ever hit the ground
Don't miss me when I'm gone, 'cause I'll be around
I'm a free spirit baby pick me up and lay me on down

That's right, wooo

Well I know I got a good life, Jim Beam
And women, they treat me right
I make my own rules, like it or not
Now don't misunderstand me baby
I give it every once and a while
Well it's tough love honey
But I'll leave you with a smile
So if I want to stay out all night long
You can't stop me from running wild
Now don't worry how long I'm gone
I'll come back every once and a while

I pick 'em up, I lay 'em all down
I never like my feet, to ever hit the ground
Don't miss me when I'm gone, Cause I'll be around
I'm a free spirit baby pick me up and lay me on down

I've been here, I've been there, I've been everywhere
I wouldn't tell you no lies
And just like me you're a wild one
Won't you take me for a ride

I pick 'em up, and lay 'em all down
I never like my feet, to ever hit the ground
Don't miss me when I'm gone, 'cause I'll be around
I'm a free spirit baby pick me up and lay me on down
Yeah I'm a free spirit baby pick me up and lay me on down

You got to lay me on down, yes you do
I'm a free spirit, oh you know you are Johnny
Oooh that's what I am oooh
