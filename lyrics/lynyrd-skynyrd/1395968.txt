Doesn't seem that long ago
Three of us walkin' down that road
Grey '55 Chevy parked in the front yard
Little Melody tagged along
Those were the best days now they're gone
Oh it's been twelve years since it went down
Lord, lost my best friend now
I can still see him fishin' on that old dock
I know I can't bring back yesterday
But oh Lord can't you help me find my way


Down to brickyard road
Oh, walk on down
Down to brickyard road
He's with me now
Swore I saw a Free Bird fly
Ridin' the winds of a Southern sky
When I hear that whistle blow
It carries me back
To brickyard road

Brother, do you realize what you've done?
Touched the hearts of everyone
You might've died too young
But your songs live on
I know I can't bring back yesterday
But we'll be all together again some day

Down on brickyard road
Oh, walk on down
Down to brickyard road
He's with me now
Swore I saw a Free Bird fly
Ridin' the winds of a Southern sky
When I hear that whistle blow
It carries me back
To brickyard road

I can see him standin' on the dock
His old chevy out in the front yard
Walk on down, walk on down

Momma and Daddy's doin' all right
I saw Melody last Saturday night
She's all grown up, she's such a pretty girl
Things just ain't the same since you left our world

Oh, brickyard road
Hear me now
I can see him, down on brickyard road

Swore I saw a Free Bird fly
Ridin' the winds of a Southern sky
And when I hear that whistle blow
It carries me back
To brickyard road
Oh, brickyard road
Oh, brickyard road
Wanna go back
To brickyard road
