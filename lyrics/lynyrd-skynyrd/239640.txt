MMMMMmmmmMMMMMmmm....

Well it took so long for me to realize
That my destiny was right before my eyes
If it were up to me to travel through this life
I'd find an open space for me to live out all my dreams


I'm such a lucky man, I try to be a stronger man
I shed a tear or two but that don't make me a weaker man
It's made me a better man, I've given all I can 
To a world that sometimes thinks that I'm a lesser man

I remember all the things I've been through
Gave myself to all those people I once knew
I'm such a lucky man

I'd like to thank you for the times that you have been with me
I hope it meant as much to you to share these memories
There's a guiding light that always seems to shine on me
If I did it again I'd be happy 'til the end

I'm a lucky man, I try to be a stronger man
I shed a tear or two but that don't make me a weaker man
It's made me a better man, I've given all I can 
To a world that sometimes thinks that I'm a lesser man

I remember all the things I've been through
Gave myself to all those people I once knew
I'm such a lucky man

It's right here in the moonlight...

Whooooooooohhhoooooohhhh
I'm a lucky man, I try to be a stronger man
I shed a tear or two but that don't make me a weaker man
It's made me a better man, I've given all I can 
To a world that sometimes thinks that I'm a lesser man
I'm a lucky man 
Yeah

MMMMMmmmmMMMMMmmm.... I'm a lucky man
Whooooooooohhhoooooohhhh.... just a lucky man
