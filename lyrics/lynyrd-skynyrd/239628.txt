Mama used to say to me: You can make your destiny
Keep your feet planted on the ground
You can always get it back, make a castle from a one room shack
It's all of what you make of what you've found
Son, you're gonna find out when you're older
There's always been the hand of God restin' right there on your shoulder


Will it be hell or heaven on earth?
The choice is up to you
Look to the sky, the answer is clear
Are you gonna live life for all it's worth?
Choose hell or heaven on earth
If you live it right, there's nothing to fear
'Cause you'll find heaven right here

Saw a man the other day, had it made in every way
Till his greed brought him down
He was blinded by the city lights, now he shivers in the cold tonight
Who will save the lifeguard when he's about to drown?

Will it be hell or heaven on earth?
The choice is up to you
Look to the sky, the answer is clear
Are you gonna live life for all it's worth?
Choose hell or heaven on earth
If you live it right, there's nothing to fear
'Cause you'll find heaven right here

You know you're gonna walk through fire
You know your gonna feel the pain
Oh you're gonna lose, if you want to win the game
And everytime your heart is breakin'
And everytime your faith is shaken
Remember what mama said, oh, that day

Hope when my time has come
I've left enough to build upon
Ain't no one gonna say I didn't try
Here's why

Hell or heaven on earth
The choice is up to you
Look to the sky, the answer is clear
Are you gonna live life for all it's worth?
Choose hell, or heaven on earth
If you live it right, there's nothing to fear
'Cause you'll find heaven right here
You'll find heaven right here
You'll find heaven right here
Heaven right here
