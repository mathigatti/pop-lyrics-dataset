Well, its 8 o'clock in Boise, Idaho 
I'll find my limo driver 
Mister, take us to the show 
I done made some plans for later on tonight 
I'll find a little queen 
And I know I can treat her right.


(Chorus) 
What's your name, little girl? 
What's your name? 
Shootin' you straight, little girl? 
Won't you do the same?.

Back at the hotel 
Lord we got such a mess 
It seems that one of the crew 
Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes 
Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar 
What a shame 
Won't you come upstairs girl 
And have a drink of champagne

What's your name, little girl? 
What's your name? 
Shootin' you straight, little girl? 
For there ain't no shame.

(Chorus) 

(Chorus) 

9 o'clock the next day 
And I'm ready to go 
I got six hundred miles to ride 
To do one more show, oh no 
Can I get you a taxi home 
It sure was grand 
When I come back here next year 
I wanna see you again

What was your name, little girl? 
What's your name? 
Shootin' you straight, little girl? 
Well there ain't no shame 
What was your name, little girl? 
What's your name? 
Shootin' you straight, little girl? 
Won't you do the same?
