It said 3:30 on my watch
Big show don’t start till nine o’clock
Thought a cold one sure would hit the spot
She started pourin’ shots
It was only me and her in there
Let’s get outta here
Might lose my job but I don’t care
Come along, if you dare


Laid down my tail gate, hey boy what you say

Do a little day drinkin’
A little bit of love makin’
A whole lotta world shakin’
Then we do it again, do it again
Start while the sun’s shinin’
Go until the stars light up the sky
Boy don’t you leave me hangin’
Cause it’s never too late
To get down and dirty
Low down and dirty

I turned up a radio, she started dancin’ real slow
Like she was puttin’ on a show
Three hours left to rock and roll
That sweat was pourin’ off her skin
Her body made me wanna sin
Right then my buzz was kickin’ in
She had a devil’s grin

And then her boss drove by, she flipped him the bird
She looked me in the eye, said “You give me the urge”

Do a little day drinkin’
A little bit of love makin’
A whole lotta world shakin’
Then we do it again, do it again
Start while the sun’s shinin’
Go until the stars light up the sky
Boy don’t you leave me hangin’
Cause it’s never too late
To get down and dirty
Low down and dirty

Do a little day drinkin’
A little bit of love makin’

Do a little day drinkin’
A little bit of love makin’
A whole lotta world shakin’
Then we did it again, did it again
Started while the sun’s shinin’
Went until the stars lit up the sky
Boy don’t you keep me hangin’
Cause it’s never too late
Low down and dirty
