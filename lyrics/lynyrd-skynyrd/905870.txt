Michelle, little girl I need you baby more than the air I breathe
My love for you grows stronger babe
My words you must believe
Well I need to see you laugh again and I want to see you smile
Michelle, little girl I love you baby you're my only child
Michelle, little girl the pain for you is hurting me inside
At night I think of you sometimes I lean my head and cry
I need to see you laugh again and I want to see you smile
Michelle, little girl I love you baby you're my only child
Michelle, little girl I need you baby more than the air I breathe
My love for you grows stronger babe
My words you must believe
Well I need to see you laugh again and I want to see you smile
Michelle, little girl I love you baby you're my only child
