Just the other day, I heard my friend say
Life was oh so bad, love was all he had
You know all day long I sing sad songs
Got the blues feel, things no doctor can heal


You know that's okay, I never change my ways
Maybe I am wrong but I'll soon be gone

If I fail no one can ever tell
And if I'm wrong, I'll soon be gone

If I fail no one can ever tell
If I'm wrong, I'll soon be gone

I don't need no friends, I don't play no games
I need lots of room to roam before I go home
You know someday, Lord, if things go my way
I'll have a son of my own left here to carry on

If I fail no one can ever tell
And if I'm wrong, I'll soon be gone

Just the other day, I heard my friend say
Life would treat him so bad, love was all he had
You know all day long, I sing sad songs
Got the blues feel, things no doctor can heal

You know that's okay, I never, never change my ways
Maybe I am wrong but I'll soon be gone
