Somewhere south of Winslow the road went right and I went left
Nothin' out my window but desert, dirt, and death
From outta nowhere stood an angel from up in the air
Sometimes that hot horizon plays tricks on you I swear


Oh, I picked her up

Sure enough that girl was real, sittin' in my truck
Said I know a place called the Broken Wheel where we can try our luck
Five miles north of 66, behind old man Lester's barn
Where the whisky flows and the money goes and the sherriff claims that he don't know

Oh, here I go again, singin'

(Bang Bang)
That cell door's closin' in
(Bang Bang)
Here I go again
(Bang Bang)
Those chains around my legs
(Bang Bang)
This is where the highway ends

4 AM I was outta cash when she whispered in my ear
I got a gun and a plan, pull the truck up to the rear
Yeah it hit me like a tire tool right between the eyes
When the door flew open - she came out screamin'
Drive fool Drive!

Oh, here I go again singin'

(Bang Bang)
That cell door's closin' in
(Bang Bang)
Here I go again
(Bang Bang)
Those chains around my legs
(Bang Bang)
Yeah this is where the highway ends

Oh, blue lights in my eyes
Oh, I must've been outta my mind!

(Bang Bang)
That cell door's closin' in
(Bang Bang)
Here I go again
(Bang Bang)
Those chains around my legs
(Bang Bang)
This is where the highway ends

Here I go again

(Bang Bang)
