I ain't the kind to stick around without it
It'd be a crime 'cause man I'm all about it
It's in my blood
It keeps me breathin'
It's like a drug - gotta have the feeling


It's been awhile since I've seen your face
What a shame, what a waste

I've been up, I've been down
I've been kicked to the ground
But I can't get my mind off of you
So I keep on movin' on to a place I belong
Hopin' you wanted me to
I'm better than I was before
I'm knocking at your door
I'm coming back for more

Some say it's love
Some say it's hate
I'm here to tell you it's never too late
If you don't use it
Man you're gonna lose it
Your sweet little nothings are what I call music

It's been awhile since I've seen your face
What a shame, what a waste

I've been up, I've been down
I've been kicked to the ground
But I can't get my mind off of you
So I keep on movin' on to a place I belong
Hopin' you wanted me to
I'm better than I was before
I'm knocking at your door
I'm coming back for more

I keep comin' back, comin' back for more
I keep comin' back, yeah I need a little more
I keep comin' back, comin' back for more
I keep comin' back...back...back

I've been up, I've been down
I've been kicked to the ground
But I can't get my mind off of you
So I keep on movin' on to a place I belong
Hopin' you wanted me to
I'm better than I was before
I'm knocking at your door
I'm coming back for more

I keep comin' back, comin' back for more
