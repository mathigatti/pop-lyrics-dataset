Mama used to send us early to bed on Christmas Eve
She became Santa's helper and they took care of me
We would wake up early from our beds only to see
The love she had for all of us was left beneath the tree


One day I know we'll be together
When the Lord brings me to you
Then I know, I will be in Heaven
When my eyes can rest on you

But until then I will remember
All the good times that we've shared
I'll hang a star upon this tree for you
On Christmas Day I know you'll be there too

Now that I am all grown up with children of my own
I see the happiness in their eyes, somehow I wish I'd known
But not a Christmas Day goes by, that I will not see
The gift you gave to all of us was the love you gave to me

One day I know we'll be together
When the Lord brings me to you
Then I know I will be in Heaven
When my eyes can rest on you

But until then I will remember
All the good times that we shared
I'll hang a star upon this tree for you
Mama, on Christmas Day I know you'll be there too

One day I know we'll be together
Then I know I will be in Heaven
I won't have to remember
'Cause I'm standing there with you
Of a time that you and I always knew
Mama, on Christmas Day I'll finally be with you

Joy to the world, the Lord has come
