I knew a man a long long time
But I never knew him at all
Small in stature, big at heart
Oh, he always stood tall


From the time that he was born
He had a style all his own
In my mind he could do no wrong
Misunderstood all along

He worked hard all his life
To get what he has today
We would all be better off, if we could
Hear those words that he had to say

He was a little rough around the edges
And through it all, we all knew he was
A little rough around the edges
Simple in mind but always had a kind eye for you
(Oh, for you, for you)

He took me by the hand
And said son, what's your plan
I won't stop you or stand in your way
Someday you'll be a man

I looked at him with hungry eyes
That only youth can know
With all his wisdom and all his years
He said, I'll teach you all that you need to know

He was a little rough around the edges
And through it all, we all knew he was
A little rough around the edges
Simple in mind but always had a kind eye for you
(Oh, for you, for you)

Don't stop now, keep moving
Don't worry about where you're going, I'll hear you
You'll feel me, I'm there no matter where you go

He was a little rough around the edges
And through it all, we all knew he was
A little rough around the edges
Simple in mind but always had a kind eye for you
(Oh, for you, for you)

He was a little rough around the edges
He was a little rough around the edges
Simple in mind, oh, oh
Simple in mind, oh, oh
