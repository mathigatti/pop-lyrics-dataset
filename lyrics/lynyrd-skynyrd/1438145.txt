Yeah, oh, oh
The only time I get up early
Is to met my mules at the fishin' hole
I wanna catch the one that got away
I wanna feel my pole bending in that way


Since I was a kid I felt this way
I fell hook, line and sinker
Gone fishin' yeah

St. John's River runs north not south
Smart enough to have a large mouth
If you can hook 'em you can mount 'em

You can keep 'em around
But if they break your line
They're gonna go back down

Since I was a kid I felt this way
I fell hook, line and sinker
Gone fishin' yeah

Oh, ain't nothing like sunrise on the lake
Or when the moon comes up at night
There's things out there that can take your life
You might just die of fright

But I'll be there come rain or shine
Cause see it's what I like to do
Only thing better than settin' my hook
Is settin' my hook in you

I fell hook, line and sinker
Gone fishin', oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, whoa, yeah

I've been everywhere, tried everything
But there ain't nothin' that feels the same
When you find the right one, it's a magical thing

Next thing you know, it's a diamond ring
She hooked me and took my name
I fell hook line and sinker
Gone fishin', yeah

Gone, gone fishin'
She hooked me
Gone, gone fishin'
Yeah, yeah

Gone, gone, gone fishin'
Yeah, she's my baby
Gone, gone, gone fishin'
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Gone fishin'
