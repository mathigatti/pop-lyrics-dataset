Well I've been ridin' a winning horse for a long, long time 
Sometimes I wonder is this the end of the line 
No one should take advantage of who they are 
No man has got it made 
If he thinks he does, he's wrong


(chorus) 
Every mother's son better hear what I say 
Every mother's son will rise and fall someday

I've seen it happen so many times, so many times before 
Some man got so much money he doesn't worry no more 
Or he's got such a pretty woman that'll treat him fine 
Well my friend has been a fool 
It happens everytime
