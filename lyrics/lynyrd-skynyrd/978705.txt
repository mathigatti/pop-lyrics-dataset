Oooh yeah oh
    On a foggy road just before sunrise
    Don't you lose control, you could lose your life
    Keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes straight ahead
    Don't forget what the good book says
    You think it can never happen to you
    But it happens all the time
    On a full moon night, something ain't right
    Didn't see it til about midnight
    When it happened it seemed kind of weird
    Things like this seem to appear
    From the shadows of a full moon night
    Never had a clock that goes at night
    That was the way of the simple life
    Right down the road come a big surprise
    Man shot his wife than took his own life
    You think it can never happen to you
    But it happens all the time
    On a full moom night, something ain't right
    Started out as an innocent fight
    Never should have happened, not around here
    Things like this seem to appear
    From the shadows of a full moon night
    ohh ohh
    On a full moon night, something aint right
    Didn't see it til about midnight
    When it happened it seemed kind of weird
    Things like this seem to appear
    From the shadows of a full moon night
    On a full moon night, something ain't right
    Started out as an innocent fight
    Never should have happened, not around here
    Things like this seem to appear
    From the shadows of a full moon night
    ohh ohh
