Oooohhh.... 

Ahhhhhhhhh....

Tornados spinnin', I sit here grinnin'
I think we've all seen this movie before
This is confusin', almost amusin'
It's hard to tell up and down anymore
When did it get so crazy, how did we lose control
Everybodies shouting, how bad it really sucks


Situation normal
All funked up, We're all funked up

We had some leaders, and they were cheaters
But they came out smelling like a rose
We should reject them, but we respect them
For what they do when the door is closed
Nothing in this world a simple man can do
Stand up and be counted, ain't you had enough

Situation normal
All funked up, Yeah we're all funked up
We're funtionally disfuntional
We're funtionally yeah disfuntional
We're all funked up

Uuughh....

Don't you know the meaning of the word snafu
Better known as trouble for me and you
Murphy's law will get ya, he's on his way
Same ol' same ol' shit a different day

Uuughh....
Oh...

Tornados spinnin', I sit here grinnin'
I think we've all seen this movie before
This is confusin', almost amusin'
It's hard to tell up and down anymore
Everybodies shouting, how bad it really sucks

Situation normal
All funked up, we're all funked up...
We're all funked up...
We're all funked up...

Ooooohhhhh....

All funked up...
