Are you a saint then don't be a stranger 
Were you sent down from Heaven to show me the way 
And if you ain't then I see a danger 
You better take a minute and hear what I've got to say


(chorus)
'Cause I'll keep on tryin' to put it straight to you 
You better give it straight to me 
'Cause most women seem to have a good time 
Makin' a fool out of me 
I'm keepin' my faith I've made up my mind 
I've got nothin' left to lose just lay it on the line 
I'm keepin' my faith yea I'll find the one 
Who won't steal me blind who won't turn and run 
I'm keepin' my faith I'm trustin' in you 
So don't treat me like those other ones do 
Ain't no gettin' 'round it tell me to my face 
Do you think I'm a fool for keepin' my faith in you

I'll treat you right I'll do you better 
I won't disappoint you I won't make you cry 
My friends tell me if you let her 
She'll empty your pockets she'll spend you dry

(repeat chorus twice)
