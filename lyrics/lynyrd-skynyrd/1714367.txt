You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town


He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
