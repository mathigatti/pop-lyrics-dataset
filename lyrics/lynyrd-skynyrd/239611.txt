What can they all be thinkin'
Wanna' take the cross off of the hill
Put away the pledge of allegience
Lord,just the thought gives me a chill
They can take God off our money but, in the end 'o ain't it
Funny
How were all gonna see him on the judgement day
So sing it loud


One more time
Hear what you say
When you got the truth inside, now they can't take that away
One more time
'Cause it ain't too late
Hold on to what you believe 'cause thay can't take that
They can't take that away

They want to change somethin' somewhere for everybody
Right now a change ain't what we need
Just like my father's father before him
They held on with pride to everything they believed
They can take God off our money but, in the end 'o aint it funny

How were all gonna see him on the judgement day

There's a fire that burns forever
Come a day we ain't gonna take no more
