My daddy told me: Always be strong son
Don't you ever cry
You find the pretty girls and then you love them
Then you say goodbye
I never dreamed that you would leave me
But now you're gone
I never dreamed that I would miss you
Woman won't you come back home


I never dreamed that you could hurt me
And leave me blue
I've had a thousand, maybe more
But never one like you
I never dreamed I could feel so empty
But now I'm down
I never dreamed that I would beg you
Woman I need you now

It seems to me I took your love for granted
It feels to me that this time I was wrong, so wrong
Oh Lord now I feel so lonely
I say woman won't you come back home

I tried to do what my daddy taught me
But I think he knew
Someday that I would find one woman like you
I never dreamed that it could feel so good, Lord
That two could be one
I never knew about sweet love
So woman won't you come back home
Oh baby won't you come back home
