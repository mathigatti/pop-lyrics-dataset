Mama told me, when I was young
Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this it will help you some sunny day
Oh, yeah


Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come, and they will pass
Go find a woman, and you'll find love
And don't forget, son, there is someone up above

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son
If you can?

Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need is in your soul
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son
Is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son
If you can?

Boy, don't you worry, you'll find yourself
Follow your heart, and nothing else
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son
Is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son
If you can?

Baby, be a simple, be a simple man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
