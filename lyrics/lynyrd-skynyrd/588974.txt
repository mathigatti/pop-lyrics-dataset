I was born a travelin' man, that's all I'll ever be
Moving around from town to town is what makes me so free
My father was a trucker for the years of 23
And on the day that I was born his truck was left to me


I'm a travelin' man
Travelin' man
Travelin' man, that's what I am
Travelin' man, oh that's what I am

Travelin' man that's what I am, no woman puts a hold on me
You'll see me once or maybe twice that's all you'll see of me
No, all you pretty women Lord, I hope you understand
Don't be a fool Lord no and put your heart in a travelin' man

I'm a travelin' man
Travelin' man
Travelin' man, that's what I am
Travelin' man

Travelin' man that's what I am
Guess I'll always be
Travelin' man that's what I am
But at least I'm free, yeah

I'm a traveler
Travelin' man, oh that's what I am

Travelin' man that's what I am, Lord I move so fast
I have had so many women, none of them have last
I am just a mover, moving fast as sound
Always free, sometimes lonely always movin' around

Travelin' man
Travelin' man, that's what I am
Travelin' man
Travelin' man, oh that's what I am

Travelin' man
