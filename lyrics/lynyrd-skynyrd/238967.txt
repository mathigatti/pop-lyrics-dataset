Well, everytime that I come home nobody wants to let me be
It seems that all the friends I got just got to come interrogate
Me
Well, I appreciate your feelings and I don't want to pass you by


But I don't ask you about your business, don't ask me about mine

Well, it's true I love the money and I love my brand new car
I like drinkin' the best of whiskey and playing in a honky tonk
Bar
But when I come off the road, well, I just got to have my time
'Cause I got to find a break in this action, else I'm gonna lose
My mind

So, don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So, don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye

That's right

Well, what's your favorite color and do you dig the
Brothers, is drivin' me up a wall
And everytime I think I can sleep, some fool has got to call
Well, don't you think that when I come home, I just want a little
Peace of mind
If you want to talk about the business buddy, you're just
Wastin' time

So, don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So, don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye

I said don't ask no stupid questions and I won't send you away
If you want to talk fishin, well, I guess that'll be ok
