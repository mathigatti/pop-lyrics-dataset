Well ever since I met you babe you've been running around 
Spendin' my hard earned money on any ol' man in town 
I've been your fool 
Oh I've been your fool 
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you 


Now I got something to you mama, ain't gonna say no lie 
Ain't gonna stand no runnin' around, don't wanna hear no alibi 
I've been your fool 
Oh I've been your fool 
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you 

You've taken every thing I had, you hurt me deep inside 
Money wasn't good enough, you had to take my pride 
I've been your fool 
Oh I've been your fool 
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you 

Oh, I've been a fool baby 
Yes I have 

Now I got something to you mama, ain't gonna say no lie 
Ain't gonna stand no runnin' around, don't wanna hear no alibi 
I've been your fool 
Oh I've been your fool 
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you 

You've taken every thing I had, you hurt me deep inside 
Money wasn't good enough, you had to take my pride 
I've been your fool 
Oh I've been your fool 
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you
