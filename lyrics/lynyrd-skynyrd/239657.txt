There's a honky-tonk just south of Georgia 
A little salvation just a' waitin' for ya' 
I heard it said a long time ago 
If your lookin' for your soul 
Down a dirt road just across the border 


Well the harder it comes you know the easier it goes 
If you can make your way a little further down that road, yea 
When your caught up in between 
Or just dyin' to be set free

(chorus) 
South of Heaven 
Always endin' up 
No matter how I try 
I'm just south of Heaven 
Don't wanna' think you can have it all 
'Cause all I need is just south of Heaven

There's a little girl they call the sweet thing 
Been some time I'd like to tell you one thing 
You have nothin' left to lose 
So by the time that you come to 
You'll be one more callin' her name

Well the harder it comes you know the easier it goes 
If you can make your way a little further down that road, yea 
When your caught up in between 
Or just dyin' to be set free

(repeat chorus)

(repeat first verse) 


(repeat chorus) 


And when I die don't cry for me 
'Cause I'll be just south of Heaven 
South of Heaven 
All I want, all I need, all I want 
Is south of Heaven
