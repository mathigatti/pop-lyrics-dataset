She’s like fashion out of a steel mine
She ain’t afraid to get dirty – have a good time
She’s kind of backwoods
She’s kind of psycho
She likes to ride fast on her motorcycle


No I can’t forget how she tastes on my lips
She’s as good as it gets I like a little bit of Homegrown
She gets me stoned
Oh in her short dress – yeah I’m a mess
I like to get her all alone
She really turns me on
Yeah in her barefeet – sippin’ sweet tea
A little Homegrown

She’s got a gun rack
Knows how to throw ‘em back
She’ll run the table but you’ll never get your money back
She makes me crazy – but she’s my baby
She knows that Jesus is the only one who saves me

No I can’t forget how she tastes on my lips
She’s as good as it gets I like a little bit of Homegrown
She gets me stoned
Oh in her short dress – yeah I’m a mess
I like to get her all alone
She really turns me on
Yeah in her barefeet – sippin’ sweet tea
A little Homegrown

No I can’t forget how she tastes on my lips
She’s as good as it gets I like a little bit of Homegrown
She gets me stoned
Oh in her short dress – yeah I’m a mess I like to get her all alone
She really turns me on
Yeah in her barefeet – sippin’ sweet tea
A little Homegrown A little Homegrown
