Love this time of year
It seems to bring us near
I wish christmas was every day
There's somethin' about those lights
On that tree at night
Feelin' you girl, next to me


Oh baby, baby the way we kiss
Under the mistletoe
A laugh like little children
Makin' angels in the snow
Well it's in your eyes
And in your smile it shows
That this very special time of year
It seems to set your heart a glow
Oh sing it with me baby

Oh, it's christmas, you know it's christmas
And it's our favorite time of year
Bells will be ringin'
Our hearts are singin'
Well i'm glad it's christmas time once again

The city's lit up bright
On this starry night
But there's somethin' left to do
Go home and light a fire
Tell me your heart's desire
Wrap me up, take me away

Oh when i'm with you darlin'
There's so much love that i want to share
I know you feel it too
There's magic in the air
And in this, sweet, sweet memories
We share together
They're gonna last us now
Now and for ever
For ever and ever

Oh, it's christmas, you know it's christmas
And it's our favorite time of year
Bells will be ringin'
Our hearts are singin'
Well i'm glad it's christmas time once again

Oh, you know it's christmas
It' christmas

Merry christmas, you know it's christmas

And it's our favorite time of year
Oh, it's merry christmas baby
