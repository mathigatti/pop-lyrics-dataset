Way down yonder you can hear the wind blow 
Through the tall grass growing in the old bayou 
The old bayou 


There's a dark haired woman that looks so fine 
Wearing hand me down clothes, drinking homemade wine 
No one ever knew who her daddy was 
The people down here say it's all because 
She's the daughter of the devil, the sister of a snake 
The keeper of souls down on Vodoo Lake 

There's a city boy across the county line 
Came looking for the legend of the girl so fine 
Well the stories that he heard, well they had to be lies 
But he found out different when he looked inher eyes 
Well he tried to run away but she had control 
He's findin' out now what everybody knows 
He knew it was over when she started to shake 
Now there's one more soul down on Voodoo Lake 

There's an eerie silence at the break of dawn 
A chill in the air, something wrong 
When a shadow crosses the ground 
Those long lost souls never make a sound 
You'd think by now they'd realize 
She'll never break her bayou ties 

She's the daughter of the devil, the sister of a snake 
The keeper of souls down on Voodoo Lake 

Voodoo Lake, Voodoo Lake 
Daughter of the Devil, sister of a snake 
Voodoo Lake 
Down on Voodoo Lake, Down on Voodoo Lake 
You can see her down on Voodoo Lake
