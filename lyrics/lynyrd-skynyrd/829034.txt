Oh yeah, all right
I do believe in you more than myself
I can depend on you when I need help
So when I tell you, please understand
That I do love you, love you man to man


Oh yeah, all right
I remember oh so well when the times were bad
If I needed anything, you'd give me all you had
And when the troubles came you were by my side
You said use God as your guide my son don't you know
He's alive, he's alive

Oh yeah
But now you have gone and I'm on my own
But I realize one thing, one man is never alone
But I wish that you were here right by my side
I would love to tell you that I know
He's alive
Oh yeah, all right
