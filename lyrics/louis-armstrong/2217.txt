Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear
And it shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has MacHeath, dear
And he keeps it, out of sight
when that shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, has MacHeath, dear
So there's never, not a trace of red


on the sidewalk, whoo sunny morning,
Lies a body oozin' life,
someones sneakin' 'round the corner
is that someone Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat,  down by the river baby
Where a cement bag's 'drooppin' on down
Oh, that cement is for the weight, dear
Bet you that he's back in town
Yeah Louie Miller disappeared here,
After drawin' out all his cash
And MacHeath spends like a sailor
did our boy's done somethin' rash?

Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver, ,
Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, dear
Now that Macky's back in town
