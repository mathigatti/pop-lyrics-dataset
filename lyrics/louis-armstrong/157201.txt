I hate's to see dat ev'nin' sun go down
Hate's to see dat ev'nin' sun go down
Cause ma baby, she done lef' dis town
If I feel tomorrow lak ah feel today
Feel tomorrow lak ah feel today
I'll pack up my trunk, and make ma git away


Saint Louis woman wid her diamon' rings
Pulls dat man 'roun' by her apron strings
'Twern't for powder an' her store-bought hair
De man she love wouldn't gone nowhere, nowhere

Got dem Saint Louis Blues I'm as blue as ah can be
Like a man done throwed that rock down into de sea
Got dem Saint Louis Blues I'm as blue as ah can be

Went to de gypsy get her fortune tole
To de gypsy, done got her fortune tole
Cause she most wile 'bout her Jelly Roll
Now dat gypsy tole her, "Don't you wear no black"
She done tole her, "Don't you wear no black
Go to Saint Louis, you can win him back" 

If she git toCairo, make Saint Louis by herself
Git to Cairo, find her old friend Jeff
gwine to pin herself, right there, to his side If she flag his train, she sho' can ride

And she sang

Got dem Saint Louis Blues jes as blue as ah can be
Dat man got a heart lak a rock cast into de sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me
Doggone it!
I loves day man lak a schoolboy loves his pie
Lak a Kentucky Col'nel loves his mint an' rye
I'll love ma baby till the day ah die

Now a black-headed gal makes a freight train jump the track
Said a black-headed gal makes a freight train jump the track
But a long tall gal makes a preacher ball the jack

Lawd, a blonde-headed woman make a good man leave the town
I said a blonde-headed woman make a good man leave the town
But a red-headed woman make a boy slap his pappy down
