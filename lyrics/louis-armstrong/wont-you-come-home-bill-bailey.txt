Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home
I've moaned the whole night long
I'll do the cookin', honey, I'll pay the rent
I know I done you wrong


You remember that rainy evenin'
I threw you out....with nothin' but a fine tooth comb
Ya, I know I'm to blame, now... ain't it a shame
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home

(instrumental break)

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come on home
I've moaned that whole day long
I'll do all the cookin' honey, I'll even pay the rent
I know, that I have done you, oh so, wrong

You remember that rainy evenin'
I throwed you out, with nothin but a fine tooth comb
I know I'm to blame, now... ain't it a shame
So baby, won't you please come

I said now, won't you please come

Bill Bailey, won't you please.... come on home
