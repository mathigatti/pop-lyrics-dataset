Georgia......Georgia..........the whole day through
Just an old sweet song.....keeps Georgia on my mind


I said now, Georgia.....Georgia......a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear.....as moonlight through the
pines

Other arms reach out to me.......other eyes smile
tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see.......the road leads
back to you

I said, Georgia........ Georgia......... no peace I
find
Just an old sweet song........keeps Georgia on my mind

(instrumental break)

Other arms reach out to me........other eyes smile
tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see......the road leads
back to you

Now ya know it's, Georgia....Georgia...no peace, no
peace I find
Just this old, sweet song......keeps Georgia on my
mind

Just this old sweet song.......keeps Georgia on my
mind
