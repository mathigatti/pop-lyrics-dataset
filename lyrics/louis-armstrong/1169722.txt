Up in the mornin' 
Out on the job 
Work like the devil for my pay 
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day. 
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids 
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray 
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day 
Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining, tears all
in my eyes 
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to
Paradise 
Show me that river, take me across 
Wash all my troubles away 
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do but rol
around heaven all day
But roll around heaven all day 
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to
Paradise 
Show me that river, take me across 
Wash all my troubles away 
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do 
But roll around heaven all day
