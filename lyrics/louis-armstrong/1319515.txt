When we are dancing
And you're 
Dangerously near me 
I get ideas 
I get ideas
I want to hold you
So much closer 
Than I dare do
I want to scold you
'Cause I care more 
Than I care to


And when you touch me
And there's fire 
In every finger
I get ideas 
Yyes I get ideas
And after 
We have 
Kissed goodnight
And still you linger
I kinda think 
You get ideas too

Your eyes 
Are always saying
The things 
You're never saying
I only hope 
They're saying
That you 
Could love me too 
For that's 
The whole idea 
It's true 
The lovely idea
That I'm falling 
In love with you 

We have 
Kissed goodnight
And still you linger
I kinda think 
You get ideas too
