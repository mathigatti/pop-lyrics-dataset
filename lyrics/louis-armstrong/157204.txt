To spend one night with you
In our old rendezvous
And reminisce with you
That's my desire


To be where gypsies play
Down in that ole cafe
We'll dance till break of day
That's my desire

We'll sip a little glass of wine
I'll gaze into your eyes divine
I'll feel the touch of your lips
Pressing on mine

To hear you whisper low
Just when it's time to go
Darling, I love you, so
That's my desire

To hear you whisper low
Doggone you know it's time to go
Darling, I love you so
You're my desire

Though you found someone new
I'll always love you
That's my desire
