Hold your hats...the roof is 'bout to tumble in
Holy cats...the walls and floors are crumblin'
Hellzapoppin'...hellzapoppin'...hellzapoppin'
The whole gang's whoopin' up the whoop-de-doo


Me oh my...it's gonna be uproarious
We'll fly high...tonight we'll be notorious
Hellzapoppin'...hellzapoppin'...hellzapoppin'
And you're invited to the party too

Better look out...ain't no cook-out
We're playin' this one by ear
We through the book out

It's a bash...the signs are unmistakable
What a smash...we're breakin' all that's breakable
There's no stoppin'...hellzapoppin'...why not drop in
We won't stop until the night is through

(instrumental break)

We won't tire...we'll fly higher
We'll be hotter by far
Than a floor on fire

Raise your glass...the party will be riotous
What a gas...the cops will never quiet us
There's no stoppin'...hellzapoppin'...hellzapoppin'
We'll be hellzapoppin' till the night is through
