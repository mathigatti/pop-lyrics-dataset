If every time it rains, it rains, pennies from heaven (Shubby Dobby)
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven (Shubby Dobby)
You'll find your fortune falling all over town
Each red and yella umbrella is up up up up upside down and...


Trade them all for a pack of a gum, sunshine and ravioli (Macaroni)
If you want the thing you love, you must have a pizzioli baby
And when you hear thunder don't run under a tree
It be pennies from heaven, for you and for me

Now come over here boy, Sam

And every time it rains it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
Every time it rains, it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
You find your fortune falling
All over town, all over town, all over town
Each red and yella umbrella
Is upside down twiddily bop

A ha ba hozzie white
Eagle eye la homba lee
Zombalomba zompolot
Old wodilly boy oh
Ahhh bobba hoy boy
Ohhhh boy a hoy boy
Toddaly whoa, OOOOH!
I knew I'd get ya
I knew I'd get ya
Let's go, let's go


And you'll find your fortune falling all over town
It be pennies from heaven
Pennies from heaven
The pennies from heaven
For you and me
