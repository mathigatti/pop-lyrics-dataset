C'EST SI BON (IT'S SO GOOD)

De
Com


C'est si bon
Lovers say that in France
When they thrill to romance
It means that itç£ so good
Cç£st si bon
So I say to you
Like the French people do
Because itç£ oh so good.
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear,
Leads to only one thought
And the thought is this, dear!
Cç£st si bon
Nothing else can replace
Just your slyest embrace
And if you only would
Be my own for the rest of my days
I will whisper this phrase
My darling, my darling...
C'est si bon!
