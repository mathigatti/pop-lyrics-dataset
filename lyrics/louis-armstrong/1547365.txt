Sitting in the sun counting my money
Fanned by my summer breeze
Sweeter than the honey is counting my money
Those greenbacks on the trees
Comes the summer shower drops of rain falling
Sweeter than the Christmas chimes
Hearing those jingles upon the roof shingles
Like pennies, nickels and dimes


Though it's known that what I own
It's not a large amount
Fields of gold that I behold
Are in my bank account
Yeah, sitting in the sun
Counting my money
Happy as I can be
And to top it all when shadows fall
I look to heaven and I see
There's a silver dollar
In the sky shining down on me

Sitting in the sun
Counting my money
Happy as I can be
And to top it all when the shadows fall
I look to heaven and I see
There's a silver dollar
In the sky and it's shining
It goes shining in
Shining down on me
