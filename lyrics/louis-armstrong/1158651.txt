Old empty bed...springs hard as lead
Feel like ol' Ned...wished I was dead
What did I do...to be so black and blue


  Even the mouse...ran from my house
They laugh at you...and scorn you too
What did I do...to be so black and blue

  I'm white...inside...but, that don't help my case
'cause I...can't hide...what is in my face
(jazzman sounds)

  How would it end...ain't got a friend
My only sin...is in my skin
What did I do...to be so black and blue

  (instrumental break)

  How would it end...ain't got a friend
My only sin...is in my skin
What did I do...to be so black and blue
