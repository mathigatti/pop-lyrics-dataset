Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose


When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak
Angels sing from above
Everyday words seems
To turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose
