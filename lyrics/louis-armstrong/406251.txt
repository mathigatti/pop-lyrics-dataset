Ella:   The tables are empty
The dance floor's deserted
You play the same love song
It's the tenth time you've heard it


That's the beginning
Just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson
In learnin' the Blues

The cigarettes you light
One after another
Won't help you forget him
And the way that you loved him

You're only burning
A torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track
For learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone
The blues will taunt you constantly
When you're out in a crowd
The Blues will haunt your memory

The nights when you don't sleep
The whole night you're cryin'
But you can't forget him
Soon you even stop tryin'

You walk the floor
And wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break
You're learnin the blues
