Chorus sings:go down moses
Way down in egypt land
Tell all pharaoes to
Let my people go!


Armstrong:
When israel was in egypt land...
Let my people go!

Oppressed so hard they could not stand...
Let my people go!

So the God seyeth: go down, moses
Way down in egypt land
Tell all pharaoes to
Let my people go!

So moses went to egypt land...
Let my people go!

He made all pharaoes understand...
Let my people go!
Yes the lord said go down, moses
Way down in egypt land
Tell all pharaoes to
Let my people go!

Thus spoke the lord, bold moses said:
-let my people go!
if not Ill smite, your firstborns dead
-let my people go!

God-the lord said go down, moses
Way down in egypt land
Tell all pharaoes to
Let my people go!

Tell all pharaoes
To
Let my people go
