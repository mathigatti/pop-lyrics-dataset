[Armstrong]
Just dig that scenery floating by,
We're now approaching Newport, Rhode I.
We've been, for years, In Variety,
But, Cholly Knickerbocker, now we're going to be


[All]
In High, High So-
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

[Armstrong]
I wanna play for my former pal-
He runs the local jazz festival.
His name is Dexter and he's good news,
But sumping kind of tells me that he's nursing the
blues

[All]
In High, High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

[Armstrong]
He's got the blues 'cause his wife, alas,
Thought writing songs was beneath his class,
But writing songs he'd not stop, of course,
And so she flew to Vegas for a quickie divorce

[All]
In High, High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

[Armstrong]
To make him sadder, his former wife
begins tomorrow a brand-new life.
She started lately a new affair
And now the silly chick is gonna marry a square

[All]
In High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

[Armstrong]
But, Brother Dexter, just trust your Satch,
To stop that wedding and kill that match.
I'll toot my trumpet to start the fun,
And play in such a way that she'll come back to you,
son,

[All]
In High, High So-
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.
