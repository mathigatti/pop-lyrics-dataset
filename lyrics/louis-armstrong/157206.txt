Where there is sunshine, oh that's where you are
Where there is laughter, then you can't be far
You're in my dreams every night
Oh how I long to hold you tight, I need you


I'll follow you dear from here to a star
Your lips are honey but sweeter by far
From now till forever I'll keep dreamin' of
You and the sunshine of love (the sunshine of love)

Where there is sunshine, oh that's where you are
Where there is laughter, then you can't be far
Yes, you're in my dreams every night
Mmm, how I long to a-hold a-you tight

I'll follow you dear from here to a star
Your lips are honey but sweeter by far
Yes now until forever I'll keep dreamin' of
You and the sunshine of love
