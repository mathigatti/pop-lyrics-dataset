Another bride, another June
Another sunny honey moon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopie


A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
It's so killin' that he's so willin'
To make whoopie

Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring

He's washing dishes and baby cloths
He's so ambitious, he even sows
But don't forget folks, that's what you get folks
For makin' whoopie

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear? Well you can't you guess
She feels neglected and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopie

Yeah, she sits alone most every night
He doesn't phone her, he doesn't write
He says he's busy, but she say's: Is he?
He's makin' whoopie

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says you'll pay six to her

He says now: Judge suppose I fail
The judge says: Budge right into jail
You better keep her I think it's cheeper
Then makin' whoopie

You better keep her
I know it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopie
