Life is so peculiar
You get so wet in the rain
You get so warm in the sunshine
It doesn't pay to complain


When I get up each morning
There's nothing to breathe but air
And when I look in the mirror
There's nothing to comb but hair
And when I sit down to breakfast
There's nothing to eat but food
Life is so peculiar but you can't stay home and brood

Oh life is so peculiar
The deserts only got sand
The oceans only got water
(and you can't drink it all)
You never know where you stand

When I get out to dinner
There's nothing to wear but clothes
Whenever I get sleepy
There's nothing to do but doze
Whenever I get thirsty
There's nothing to do but drink
Life is no peculiar that it makes you stop and think

Yes, life is so peculiar
A fork belongs with a knife
Corn beef is lost without cabbage
A husband should have a wife
Life is so peculiar but, as everybody says, "That's life"

Oh life is so peculiar
A bird can usually sing
A pearl is made by an oyster
You can be sure of a thing

Well when I get tired of resting
There's nothing to do but walk
When I don't care to listen
There's nothing to do but talk
When I'm up in an airplane
There's nothing to do but fly
Life is so peculiar but I always wonder why
