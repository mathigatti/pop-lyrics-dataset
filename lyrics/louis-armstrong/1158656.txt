Well, give me land, lots of land under starry skies
above
But don't fence me in
Let me ride through that wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in


Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
I don't like hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in

(instrumental break)

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies 
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise 

I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
Gaze at that ole moon until I lose my senses
I can't stand them hobbles and I don't care for fences
Don't fence me in

Oh no...don't you fence me in
