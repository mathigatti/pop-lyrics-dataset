Only you, can make this world seem right
Only you, can make the darkness bright
Only you, and you alone, can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you


Only you, can make this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand, i understand
The magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you

Only you, can make this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand, i understand
The magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you

One and only you....
