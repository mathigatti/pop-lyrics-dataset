Bye bye blues.... bye bye blues
Bells ring.... birds sing
Sun is shin-in'.... no more pin-in'


Just we two...smil-in' through
Don't sigh....don't cry
Bye bye blues

(instrumental break)

Bye bye blues....I'm sayin' bye bye blues
Bells will ring and birds all sing
Stop your mope-in', Keep on hope-in'

You and me....can't you see
Now don't you sigh.....and don't you cry
Bye bye blues
