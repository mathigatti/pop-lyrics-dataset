When you're smilin' keep on smilin'
The whole world smiles with you
And when you're laughin', oh, when youre laughin'
The sun comes shinin' Through


But when you're cryin' you bring on the rain
So stop your sighin 'be happy again
Keep on smilin cause when you're smilin'
The whole world smiles with you

Oh, when you're smilin' keep on smilin'
The whole world smiles with you
Ah when you're laughin' keep on laughin'
The sun comes shinin' through

Now when you're cryin' you bring on the rain
So stop that sighin' be happy again
Keep on smilin cause when you're smilin'
And the whole world smiles with you

The great big world will smile with

The whole wide world will smile with you
