Whispering while you cuddle near me
Whispering so no one can hear me
Each little whisper seems to cheer me
I know it's true dear....there's no one but you


  I'm a singin'

  Whispering why you'll never leave me
Whispering why you'll never grieve me
Whisper and say that you believe me
Whispering that I love you

  (instrumental break)

  Whispering while you cuddle near me
Whispering so no one can hear me
Each little whisper seems to cheer me
Just whispering that I love you
