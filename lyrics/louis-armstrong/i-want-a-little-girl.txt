I want a little girl, call my own
She must be someone who's all alone now
Say, I want a little girl to fall in love with me, oh yeah


I want a little girl, but she may not look
Just like a picture in a story book
If she can cook chicken, yeah, she'll suit me to a T

And she don't have to wave her hair
Or even wear fancy clothes, I wouldn't even care
She don't wear nylon hose, oh

I want a little girl to love a lot
You know that I'd give her everything I got
I want a little girl to fall in love with me
