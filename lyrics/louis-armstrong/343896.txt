Hello Central,
What's the matter with this line? 
I wanna talk to that high brown of mine 
Tell me how long 
Will I have to wait 
Please give me two ninety-eight 
Why do you hesitate?


Oh, what you say, 
Can't talk to my brown 
A storm last night blowed the wires all down 
Now, tell me how long 
Will I have to wait 
Oh, won't you tell me now 
Why do you hesitate?

(Instrumental break)

(Velma)
Say, Sunday night 
My beau proposed to me 
Said he'd be happy if his wife I be 
Said he, "how long, 
Baby, will I have to wait? 
Come be my wife, my Kate 
Why do you hesitate?"

Say, I declined him 
It was just for a stall 
He left that night on the cannonball 
Honey, oh honey, how long 
Will I have to wait? 
Oh, won't you tell me now 
Baby, why do you hesitate?
