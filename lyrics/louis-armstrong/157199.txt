Moon river
Wider than a mile
I'm crossing you
In style some day
Oh, dream maker
You heart breaker
Wherever you're goin'
I'm goin' your way


Two drifters
Off to see the world
There's such
A lot of world to see
We're after
The same rainbow's end
Waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon river
And me

Moon river
Wider than a mile
I'm crossin' you
In style some day
Oh, dream maker
You heart breaker
Wherever you're goin'
I'm goin' your way

Two drifters
Off to see the world
There's such
A lot of world to see
We're after
That same rainbow's end
Waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon river
And me
