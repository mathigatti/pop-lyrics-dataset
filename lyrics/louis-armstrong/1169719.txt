Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree,
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud, I can't
understand,
I get misty, just holding your hand.


Walk my way, and a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello, that music I
hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.

(BRIDGE)

*You can say that you're leading me on,
But it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost,
That's why I'm following you.

On my own, would I wander through this wonderland
alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left, my hat from
my glove,
I'm too misty, and too much in love.
I'm too misty, and too much in love.

(Instrumental interlude and pick up at bridge*.)
