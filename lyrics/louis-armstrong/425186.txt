You must remember this 
A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh 
The fundamental things apply 
As time goes by 
And when two lovers woo 
They still say, "I love you" 
On that you can rely 
No matter what the future brings 
As time goes by 
Moonlight and love songs 
Never out of date 
Hearts full of passion 
Jealousy and hate 
Woman needs man 
And man must have his mate 
That no one can deny 
it's still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by
