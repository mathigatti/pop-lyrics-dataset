Give me your kisses, I'll give you my heart
Give me your promise that we'll never part
I'll give you love and devotion
High as the sky above, deeper than the deepest ocean


Give me the right to call you all mine
And I'll be true till the ending of time
Give me your kisses, I'm willing to start
And I'll give you my heart

Give me the right to call you all mine
And I'll be true till the ending of time
Give me your kisses, I'm willing to start
And I'll give you my heart
