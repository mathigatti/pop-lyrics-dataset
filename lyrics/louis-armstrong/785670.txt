You coax the blues right out of the horn, Mame, 
You charm the husk right off of the corn, Mame, 
You've got the banjoes strummin' and plunkin' out a tune to beat the band, 
The whole plantation's hummin' since you brought Dixie back to Dixieland. 


You make your Louis, feel like the king, Mame 
You make the world we're living in swing, Mame 
You make the old magnolia tree, blossom at the mention of your name. 
Your special fascination'll, prove to be inspirational, 
I think you're just sensational, Mame.
