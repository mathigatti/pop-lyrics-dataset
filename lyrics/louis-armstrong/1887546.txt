We lived our little drama
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on alabama
Last night


I can't forget the glamour
Your eyes held a tender light
While (and) stars fell on alabama (fractured 'bama)
Last night

I never planned in my imagination
A situation - so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center - just you and me

My heart beat (just) like a hammer
(my) arms wound around you tight
And (while) stars fell on alabama
Last night
