You look at me...and then a song begins
Played on a million...velvet violins
My head goes reelin'...and around it spins
Fantastic...fantastic...that's you


You whisper Darlin'...and before my eyes
A blaze of fireworks...light up the skies
My heart grows wings...and away it flies
Fantastic...fantastic...that's you

You perform miracles
Whenever you hold me near
Tender, warm miracles
That make me surrender dear

And when you kiss me...heaven opens wide
And there you are...inviting me inside
No wonder angels up there...have staring eyes
Fantastic...fantastic...that's you

(instrumental break)

Yes, and when you kiss me...heaven opens wide
And there you are...inviting me inside
No wonder angels have...those staring eyes
Fantastic...fantastic...that's you

I said fantastic...fantastic...thatâs you
