We are trav'ling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)


O when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the moon turns red with blood
When the moon turns red with blood
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

On that hallelujah day
On that hallelujah day
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

O when the trumpet sounds the call
O when the trumpet sounds the call
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Some say this world of trouble
Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed

When the revelation (revolution) comes
When the revelation (revolution) comes
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the rich go out and work
When the rich go out and work
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the air is pure and clean
When the air is pure and clean
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When we all have food to eat
When we all have food to eat
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When our leaders learn to cry
When our leaders learn to cry
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
