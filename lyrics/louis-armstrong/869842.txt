Ev'ry honeybee.... fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me
I don't blame them....goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose


When you're passin' by....flowers drop and sigh
And i know the reason why
You're much sweeter....goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar....you just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar....it's so sweet when you stir it up

When i'm taking sips...from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

You're confection.....goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose.

Don't buy sugar....you just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar....it's so sweet when you stir it up

When i'm taking sips...from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips
You're confection.....goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose.

I said you're confection.....goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose.
