Way down yonder in New Orleans 
In the land of the dreamy scenes
There's a garden of Eden...you know what I mean


  Creole babies with flashin' eyes 
Softly whisper their tender sighs
Then stop....won't you give your lady fair...a little
smile
Stop..ya bet your life you'll linger there...a little
while

  We've got heaven right here on earth
With those beautiful queens
Way down yonder in New...Orleans

  (instrumental break)

  You're gonna find heaven right here on earth
With all them beautiful queens
Way down yonder in New Or.....

  I goin' down yonder to New Orleans

  It's way down yonder in New Orleans
