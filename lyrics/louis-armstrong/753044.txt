Now one time there lived an old man
With a very crooked nose
He lived inside a log hut
and they called him ol' man Mose
One dark and dreary morning I knocked upon his door
I didn't hear a single sound
so I ain't gonna do it no more.


'cos I believe ol' man, I believe ol' man
I believe ol' man, thatol' man Mose is dead.
I believe ol' man, I believe ol' man
I believe ol' man, that ol' man Mose is dead.

(Now you believe) Mose kicked the bucket
(You believe) Mose kicked the bucket
(You believe) Mose kicked the bucket
(You believe he's dead)

(You believe) Mose kicked the bucket
(You believe) Mose kicked the bucket
(You believe) Mose kicked the bucket
(You believe he's dead)

Now listen here,
I went round to the window
And I peeped in through the crack,
Inside there was an old man
Laying flat upon his back
I thought that he was sleeping
Head hung to the floor
He didn't make a single move
So I ain't gonna do it no more

'cos I found out ol' man, I found out ol' man
yeah, I found out ol' man, ol' man Mose is dead

('cos you found out) ol' man
(you found out) ol' man
(you found out) ol' man
(you found out he's dead)

(you found out) Mose kicked the bucket
(you found out) Mose kicked the bucket
(you found out) Mose kicked the bucket
(you found out he's dead)


(you found out) Mose kicked the bucket
(you found out) Mose kicked the bucket
(you found out) Mose kickin' up daisies
(you found out he's dead)

Old Man Mose is dead.
