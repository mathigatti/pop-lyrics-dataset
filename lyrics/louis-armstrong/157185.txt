I had a woman
Livin' way back o' town
Yeah she treated me right
Never let me down
But I wasn't satisfied
I had to run around


Now she's gone and left me
I'm worried as can be
Oh I've searched this world all over
Wonderin' where she could be
I would ask that she forgive me
And maybe she'll come back to me

(but I doubt it)

I'm lonesome an blue
And I've learned a thing or two
Oh fellas here's a tip
I'm gonna pass on down to you
Never mistreat your woman
Cause it's gonna bounce right back on you
