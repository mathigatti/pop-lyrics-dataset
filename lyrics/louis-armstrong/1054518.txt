When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you


If your hearts is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
Like dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret losing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and pulls you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dream comes true.
