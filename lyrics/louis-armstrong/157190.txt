C'est si bon 
Lovers say that in France 
When they thrill to romance 
It means that it's so good 
C'est Si Bon
So I say to you 
Like the French people do 
Because it's oh so good.
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear, 
Leads to only one thought 
And the thought is this, dear! 
C'est Si Bon
Nothing else can replace 
Just your slyest embrace 
And if you only would
Be my own for the rest of my days 
I will whisper this phrase 
My darling, my darling... 
C'est si bon!
