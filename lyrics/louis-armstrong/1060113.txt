I got rhythm....i got music....i got my gal
Who can ask for anything more


I got daisies....in green pastures....i got my gal
Who could ask for anything more

Old man trouble....i dont mind him.
You wont find him.... round my door

I got starlight...i got sweet dreams...i got my gal
Who could ask for anything more

(instrumental break)

I got rhythm....i got music....i got my gal
Who can ask for anything more

Who could ask for anything more
