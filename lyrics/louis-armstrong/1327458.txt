Tall and tan 
And young and lovely 
The girl from Ipanema 
Goes walking 
And when she passes 
Each one she passes goes 
Oooh 
When she walks 
She's like a samba 
That swings so cool 
And sways so gentle 
That when she passes 
Each one she passes goes 
Oooh 
Oh 
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her 
I love her? 
Yes 
I would give 
My heart gladly 
But each day 
When she walks 
To the sea 
She looks 
Straight ahead 
Not at me 


Tall and tan 
And young and lovely 
The girl from Ipanema 
Goes walking 
And when she passes 
I smile 
But she doesn't see 

(Ooh) 
Oh 
But I watch her 
So sadly
How can I tell her 
I love her? 
Yes 
I would give 
My heart gladly 
But each day 
When she walks 
To the sea 
She looks 
Straight ahead 
Not at me 

Tall and tan 
And young and lovely 
The girl from Ipanema 
Goes walking 
And when she passes 
I smile 
But she doesn't see
And when she passes 
I smile 
But she doesn't see
She doesn't 
She doesn't
She doesn't see
