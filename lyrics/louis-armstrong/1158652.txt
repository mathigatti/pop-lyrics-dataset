No one to talk to ....all by myself
No one to walk with.....I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'......savin' all my love for you


I know for certain......the one I love
I'm through with flirtin'......it's just you that I've
been thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'.......savin' all my love for you

Like Jack Horner.....in that ole corner
Don't go nowhere.....what do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for......believe me

I don't stay out late.......no where to go
I'm home about eight......just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'.......savin' all my love for you

(instrumental break)

Like Jack Horner.....in that ole corner
Don't go nowhere.....what do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for......believe me

I don't stay out late.......no where to go
I'm home about eight......just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'.......savin' all my love for you

Ain't misbehavin'......I'm savin all my love for you
