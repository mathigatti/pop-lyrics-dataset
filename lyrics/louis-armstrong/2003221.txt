Well, ezekiel saw the wheel a rolling, the great big wheel a turning over
Ezekiel saw the wheel a rolling, way in the middle of the air
Great god
Ezekiel saw the wheel a-rolling, the great big wheel a-turning over
Ezekiel saw the wheel a-rolling, way in the middle of the air


Well great god almighty if i can declare,
Ezekiel saw the wheel in the middle of the air
A great big wheel, and a little bitty wheel,
A wheel turning over in the middle of the wheel

The good book says and the book don't lie
God told ezekiel to prophesy
The mighty god spoke in ezekiel's mind he raised his voice and began to cry

He cried "old bones, old bones a-walking,
Great god almighty the old bones a-talking"
Old bones, bones, won't you hear me now
Old bones you hear the word of god

Ezekiel saw the wheel a-rolling, the great big wheel a-turning over
Ezekiel saw the wheel a-rolling, way in the middle of the air
Great god
Ezekiel saw de wheel a rolling, the great big wheel a-turning over
Ezekiel saw the wheel a rolling, way in the middle of the air

Well god told ezekiel to prophesy and zeke tried to do it and that's no lie
God sent the wind from the west to the east
Spirits struck him from his head to his feet

He cried "old bones, old bones a-walking,
Great god almighty the old bones a-talking"
Old bones, bones, won't you hear me now
Old bones you hear the word of god

Ezekiel saw the wheel a-rolling, the great big wheel a-turning over
Ezekiel saw the wheel a-rolling, way in the middle of the air

Well old 'zekiel tried his best to do, the thing the lord had told him to
He did his best that's all he can
After all zeke was a natural man

Ezekiel saw the wheel a-rolling, the great big wheel a-turning over
Ezekiel saw the wheel a-rolling, way in the middle of the air
Great god (one more, one more)
Ezekiel saw de wheel a rolling, the great big wheel a-turning over
Ezekiel saw the wheel a rolling, way in the middle of the air
Yes he did - old zeke was wailing that time
