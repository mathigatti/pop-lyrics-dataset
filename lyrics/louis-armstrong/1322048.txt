Sleigh bells ring 
Are you listening? 
In the lane 
Snow is glistening 
A beautiful sight 
We're happy tonight 
Walking 
In a winter wonderland 


Gone away 
Is the bluebird 
Here to stay 
Is a new bird 
He sings a love song 
As we go along 
Walking 
In a winter wonderland 

In the meadow 
We can build a snowman 
And pretend 
That he is Parson Brown 
He'll say are you married? 
We'll say No man 
But you can do the job 
When you're in town 

Later on, we'll conspire 
As we dream, by the fire 
To face unafraid 
The plans that we've made 
Walking 
In a winter wonderland 

In the meadow 
We can build a snowman 
And pretend 
That he's a circus clown 
We'll have lots of fun 
With Mr. Snowman 
Until the other kids 
Come knock him down 

When it's cold 
Ain't it thrilling 
When your nose 
Gets to chilling 
We'll frolic and play 
The eskimo way 
Walking 
In a winter wonderland 

Walking 
In a winter wonderland
