When I walk down the street
Seems everyone I meet
Gives me a friendly hello
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so


The birds in every tree
All sing so merrily
They sing wherever I go
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

Well if you should ask me the amount in my bank account
I must confess that I'm slipping
But that don't bother me, cause confidentially
I've got a dream that's pippin

And when my day is through
Each night I hurry to
A love that's faithful I know
I guess I'm just a lucky so an so
