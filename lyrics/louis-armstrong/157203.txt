Summer time
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
Oh your daddy's rich
And your mama's good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't you cry


One of these mornings
You're gonna rise up singin'
You're spread your wings
And soar to the sky
But 'till that mornin'
There ain't nothin' to harm you
With your mama and your daddy
Standin' by

Summer time
And the livin is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
Oh your daddy's rich
And your mama's good lookin'
So hush little baby
Baby don't you cry

Don't cry
