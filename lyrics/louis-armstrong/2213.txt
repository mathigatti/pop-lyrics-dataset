I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream awhile, scheme awhile, we're sure to find
Happiness, and I guess, all those things you've always pinedfor
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets woolworth doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day, you know darned well, baby
I can't give you anything but love
