Yes, I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Like I've been doin' ever since we've been apart
I get some consolation when I read
Of someone elses lonely heart, yes
I wonder if you get the papers too
And if you feel as melancholy as I do
Until you're in my arms again, never more to roam
I guess I'll get the papers and go home, yes


I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Like I've been doin' ever since we've been apart
Yes, I get some consolation when I read
Of someone elses lonely heart
Mmm, I wonder if you get the papers too
And if you feel as melancholy as I do
Baby, till you're in my arms again, never more to roam
I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Yes, I guess I'll get the papers and go home
