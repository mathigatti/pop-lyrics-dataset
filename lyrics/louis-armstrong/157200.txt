Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worries on the doorstep
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street


Can't you hear the pitter-pat
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be complete
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade with my blues on parade
But I'm not afraid, this rover's crossed over

If I never had a cent
I'd be rich as rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade with them blues on parade
Now I'm not afraid, this rover has crossed over

Now if I never made one cent
I'll still be rich as rockefeller
There will be goldust at my feet
On the sunny
On the sunny, sunny side of the street
