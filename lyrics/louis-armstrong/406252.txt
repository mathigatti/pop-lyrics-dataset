Old empty bed
Springs all of lead
Feel like old Ned
Wished I was dead
What did I do
To be so black
And blue?


Even the mouse
Ran from my house
They laugh at you
And scorn you too
What did I do
To be so black
And blue?

I'm white
Inside
But that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide
What is in my face
How will it end
Ain't got a friend
My only sin
Is in my skin
What did I do
To be so black
And blue?

How will it end
Aint got a friend
My only sin
Is in my skin
What did I do
To be so black and blue?
