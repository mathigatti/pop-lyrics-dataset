The story of Shadrack, Meshach and Abednego!

There was three children from the land of Israel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
They took a little trip to the land of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
He took a lot of gold, and made an idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!


And he told everybody: When you hear the music of the trombone
And he told everybody: When you hear the music of the clarinet
And he told everybody: When you hear the music of the horn
You must fall down and worship the idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

But the children of Israel would not bow down!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
I said you couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

So the king put the children in the fiery furnace
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Eleven times hotter, hotter than it oughtta be!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

But the Lord sent an angel with the snow-white wings
Down in the middle of the furnace
Talkin' to the children 'bout the power of the Gospel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

Well they couldn't burn a hair on the head of
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Laughin' and talkin' while the fire jumpin' round
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

Old Nebudchanezzer called: Hey there!
When he saw the power of the Lord
And they had a regal time in the house of Babylon
Shadrack! Meshach, Abednego!
Oh, Abednego!!
