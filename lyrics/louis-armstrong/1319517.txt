Magnolia trees 
At night
Sparkling bright
Fields of cotton 
Look Wintery white
When it's 
Christmas time 
In New Orleans


A barefoot choir 
In prayer
Fills the air
Mississippi folks 
Are gathering there
When it's 
Christmas time 
In New Orleans

You'll see 
A dixieland Santa Claus
Leading the band
To a good old Creole beat
And golly what a spirit
You can only hear it
Down on Basin Street
Your cares will disappear
When you hear
Hallelujah 
St. Nicholas is here
When it's Christmas time 
In New Orleans

Oh, yeah, baby

You'll see 
A dixieland Santa Claus
Leading the band
To a good old Creole beat
And golly what a spirit
You can only hear it
Down on Basin Street
Your cares will disappear
When you hear
Hallelujah 
Old St. Nicholas is here
When it's Christmas time 
In New Orleans

When it's 
Christmas time in 
In New Orleans
