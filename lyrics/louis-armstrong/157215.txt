'Zat You, Santa Claus?
Gifts I'm preparing
For some
Christmas sharing
But I pause because
Hanging my stocking
I can hear a knocking
'Zat you, Santa Claus?


Sure is dark out
Ain't the slightest
Spark out
'Pon my slackened jaw
Who's there?
Who is it
Stopping for a visit?
'Zat you, Santa Claus?

Are you bringing
A present for me
Something pleasantly
Pleasant for me?
Then it's just
What I've been waiting for
Would you mind
Slipping it under the door?

Cold winds are howling
Or could that be growling?
My legs feel like straws
My, my, oh, me, my
Kindly would you reply?
'Zat you, Santa Claus?

Hanging the stocking
I can hear a knocking
'Zat you, Santa Claus?
I say, who's there
Who is it?
Are you stopping
For a visit?
'Zat you, Santa Claus?

Oh there, Santa
You gave me a scare
Now stop teasing
Cause I know
You're there
We don't believe
In no goblins today

But I can't explain
Why I'm shaking that way
Bet I can see
Ole Santa in the keyhole
I'll get to the cause
One peek
And I'll try there

Oh, oh
There's an eye there
'Zat you, Santa Claus?
Please, please
Pity my knees
Say that's you
Santa Claus
