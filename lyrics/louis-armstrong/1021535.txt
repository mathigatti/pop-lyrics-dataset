I'll take the legs from some old table
I'll take the arms from some old chair
I'll take the neck from some old bottle
And from a horse I'll take the hair


I'll take the hands and face from some old clock
And baby when I'm through
I'll get more loving from the dum-dum-dummy
Than I ever got from you

Get me some legs get me a chair
And a bottle, too

Give a horse give me some time
And baby when I'm through

I'll take the legs from some old table
I'll take the arms from some old chair
I'll take the neck from some old bottle
And from a horse I'll take the hair

I'll take the hands and face from some old clock
And baby when I'm through
I'll get more loving from the dum-dum-dummy
Than I ever got from you

I get more loving from the dum-dum-dummy
Than I ever got from you

Yeah Mama get more loving
From a dummy than I get from you
