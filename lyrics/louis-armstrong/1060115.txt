Lazybones, sleepin in the sun....how you spect to get your days work done? 
You cant get your days work done......sleepin in the noon day sun


Lazybones, layin in the shade....how you gonna get your cornmeal made? 
You cant get no cornmeal made....sleepin in that evening shade

When taters need sprayin, I bet you keep prayin
The bugsll fall off of the vine
And when you go fishin I bet you keep wishin
Them fish dont grab your line

Lazybones, loafin all the day.....how you spect to make a dime that way? 
You wont make no dime that way.....loafin in the shade all day
