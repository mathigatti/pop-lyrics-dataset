Yes, I've got someone new,
I've had enough of you,
I'm tired of your lying,
So throw it out your mind,


You toss me around,
Lately I've found,
That someone else's love,
Can be so fine.

So bye bye my friend!
Too bad it had to end!
My brand new love is waiting so I'll see you now and then,

But as,
Of now,
We're through,
And how,
So throw,
It,
Out,
Your,
Mind
