Up a lazy river by the old mill stream
That lazy, hazy river where we both can dream
Linger in the shade of an old oak tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream with me


Up a lazy river where the Robin's song
Wakes up in the mornin', as we roll along
Blue skies up above everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we will be, now
Up a lazy river with me

Up a lazy river by the old mill run
That lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
You can linger in the shade of that fine ole tree
Throw, away your troubles, baby, dream with me

Up a lazy river where the Robin's song
Wakes a brand new mornin' as we roll along
There are blue skies up above and as long as we're in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we could be
If you go up a lazy river with me
Ah said with me now goin' up that lazy river with me
