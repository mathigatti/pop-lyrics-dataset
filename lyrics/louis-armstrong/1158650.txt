Didn't he ramble.... he rambled 
Rambled all around.... in and out of town
Didn't he ramble....didn't he ramble 
He rambled till the butcher cut him down


His feet was in the market place..his head was in the
street 
Lady pass him by, said..look at the market meat
He grabbed her pocket book..and said I wish you well
She pulled out a forty-five..said I'm head of
personnel

Didn't he ramble...I said he rambled
Rambled all around...in and out of town 
Didn't he ramble...oh didn't he ramble 
He rambled till the butcher shot him down

(instrumental break)

He slipped into the cat house..made love to the stable
Madam caught him cold..said I'll pay you when I be
able
Six months had passed ..and she stood all she could
stand
She said buddy when I'm through with you
Ole groundhog gonna be shakin yo' hand

And didn't he ramble...he rambled
Rambled all around...in and out of town 
Oh didn't he ramble......he rambled 
You know he rambled...till the butcher...cut him down

I said he rambled..lord...'till the butcher shot him
down
