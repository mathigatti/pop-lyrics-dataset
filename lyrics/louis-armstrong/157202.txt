Sometimes I wonder
Why, I spend such lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
That melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss, an inspiration
Oooh but that was long ago
Now my consolation, is in the stardust of a song


Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale hums his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
Always in my heart it will remain baby
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain
And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the dust of my heart, my heart!
