All that meat, and no potatoes
Just ain't right, like green tomatoes
Yeah, i'm waiting
Palpatatin'
But all that meat, and no potatoes


All that meat, and no potatoes
All that food, to the alligators, yeah
Hold me steady
I am ready
With all that meat and no potatoes

I don't think that peas are bad
With me, most anything goes
I look in the pot, i'm fit to fight
'cause woman, you know that mess ain't right.

All that meat, and no potatoes
Just ain't right, like green tomatoes
Yes, i'm steamin'
I'm really screamin'
All that meat and no potatoes.

(where's my fine hambone?!? where is it?!?)
