The way you wear your hat 
The way you sip your tea 
The memory of all that 
No they can't take that away from me 


The way your smile just beams 
The way you sing off key 
The way you haunt my dreams 
No they can't take that away from me 

We may never ever meet again, on that bumpy road to
love 
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of 

The way you hold your knife 
The way we danced till three 
The way you changed my life 
No they can't take that away from me 
No they can't take that away from me 

The way your smile just beams 
The way you sing off key 
The way you haunt my dreams 
No they can't take that away from me 

We may never ever meet again, on that bumpy road to
love 
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of 

The way you hold your knife 
The way we danced till three 
The way you changed my life 
No you can't take that away 
You can't take that away from me 
No you can't take that away from me
