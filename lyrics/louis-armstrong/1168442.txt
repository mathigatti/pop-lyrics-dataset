The loveliness of Paris 
Seems somehow sadly gay
The glory that was Rome 
Is just another day
I've been terribly alone 
And forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going home 
To my city by the bay


Chorus: 
I left my heart in San Francisco 
High on a hill it calls to me
To be where little cable cars 
Climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may 
Chill the air, I don't care

My love waits there in San Francisco 
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco 
Your golden sun will shine for me
