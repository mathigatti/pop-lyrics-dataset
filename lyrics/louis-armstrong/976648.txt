{verse 1)
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows but Jesus
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Glory Hallelujah
-repeat verse-


Sometimes I'm up and sometimes I'm down
Yes lord, you know sometimes I'm almost to the ground
O yes, Lord, still
-verse 1-

You got here before I do
O yes Lord, don't forget to tell all my friends I'm coming too

O yes Lord, still
-verse 1-
