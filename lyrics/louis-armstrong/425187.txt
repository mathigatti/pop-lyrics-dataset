Blue skies, smilin' at me
Nothin' but blues skies do I see


Bluebirds singin' a song
There's nothin' but bluebirds all day long

Seems like all the days are hurryin' by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Those blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on

Seems like all them days are hurryin' by
Cause when you're in love, then my how they fly

Them blue days, all of 'em gone
And there's nothin' but blue skies from now on
