Won't you come and go with me
Down that Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Come along with me on, down to new orleans


Now the band's there to greet us
Old friends will meet us
Where all them folks goin to the St. Louis cemetary meet
Heaven on earth, they call it basin street

I'm tellin' ya, basin street is the street
Where all them characters from the first street they meet
New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never miss them rice and beans
Way down south in New Orleans

They'll be huggin' and a kissin'
That's what I been missin'
And all that music lord, if you just listen'
New orleans, I got them basin street blues

Now ain't you glad you went with me
On down that Mississippi
We took a boat to the land of dreams
Heaven on earth they call it basin street
