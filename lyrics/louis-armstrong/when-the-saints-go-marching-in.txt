Oh, when the saints go marching in,
Oh, when the saints go marching in,
Oh, Lord I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in.


Oh, when the sun refuse to shine,
Oh, when the sun refuse to shine,
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the sun refuse to shine.

Oh, when they crown Him Lord of all,
Oh, when they crown Him Lord of all,
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When they crown Him Lord of shine.

Oh when they gather round the throne,
Oh when they gather round the throne,
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When they gather round the throne.
