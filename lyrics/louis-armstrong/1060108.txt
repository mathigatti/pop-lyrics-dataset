Oh, the shark has pretty teeth dear
And he shows 'em, pearly white
Just a jack knife has Macheath dear
And he keeps it way out of sight


When that shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows they begin to spread
Fancy white gloves has Macheath dear
So there's never, never a trace of red

On the sidewalk, one Sunday morning
Lies a body, oozin' life
Someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone perhaps, per chance be Mack the Knife

From a tugboat, on the river going slow
A cement bag is dropping down 
You know that cement is for the weight dear
You can make a large bet Macheath's in town

My man Louis Miller, he split the scene babe
After drawing out all the bread from his stash
Now Macheath spends like a sailor
Do you suppose this guy, he did something rash

Old Satchmo, Louis Armstrong, Bobby Darrin
They did this song nice, Lady Ella too
They all sang it, with so much feeling
That Old Blue Eyes, he ain't gonna add nothing new

But with this big, fat band, jumping behind me
Swinging hard, Jack, I know I can't lose
When I tell you, all about Mack the Knife babe
It's an offer, you can never refuse

We got Patrick Williams, Bill Miller playing that piano
And this wonderful, great big band, bringing up the rear
All these bad cats, in this band now 
They make the greatest sounds, you're ever gonna hear

Oh Sookie Taudry, Jenny Diver, Polly Peachum, Old Miss Lulu Brown

Hey the line forms, on the right dear
Now that Macheath,that bum is back in town
You'd better lock your doors, and call the law
Because Mackie's back in town
