I'll see you in my dreams
And then I'll hold you in my dreams
Someone took you right out of my arms
Still I feel the thrill of your charms


Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light my way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

(instrumental break)

Yes I will...see you in my dreams
You know I'll...hold you in my dreams
I know that...someone took you right out of my arms
But...still I feel the thrill of your charms

I dream of...lips that once were mine
And those...tender eyes that shine
I know...theyâll light my way tonight
When I...see you in my dreams

Yes they will...light my way tonight
Because I'll...see you in my dreams
