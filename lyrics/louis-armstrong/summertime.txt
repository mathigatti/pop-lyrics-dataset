Summertime, and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'...and the cotton is high
Yo' daddy's rich...and yo' mama's good-lookin'
So, hush, little baby don't you cry


One of these mornin's..you gonna rise up singin'
You gonna spread your little wings...and you'll take to the sky
But 'till that mornin'...there ain't nothin' gonna harm you
With yo Mama and Daddy...standin' bye

Now it's summertime and the livin' is easy
Them fish are jumpin'and the cotton's 'bout waist high
Yo' daddy's rich and, ya know, yo' mama's good-lookin'
Now, hush, little baby, don't you cry

Summertime

Ah, said it's summertime
