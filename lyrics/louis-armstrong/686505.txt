Fantastic, that's you


You look at me and then a song begins,
Played on a million velvet violins,
My head goes reelin' and around it spins...
Fantastic, fantastic, that's you, yes


You whisper "darling" and before my eyes
A blaze of fireworks light up the skies
My heart grows wings then away it flies
Fantastic, fantastic, that's you

You perform miracles whenever you hold me near
Tender, warm miracles that make me surrender dear, yes

And when you kiss me heaven opens wide
And there you are inviting me inside
No wonder angels that have staring eyes
Fantastic, fantastic, that's you

------ instrumental break ------

Yes, and when you kiss me heaven opens wide
And there you are inviting me inside
No wonder angels that have staring eyes
Fantastic, fantastic, that's you
