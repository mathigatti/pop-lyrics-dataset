Missed the Saturday dance....heard they crowded the
floor
I couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore


Went to visit the club....I got as far as the door
They'd've asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Well darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But never the less, why stir up memories

I've been invited on dates......should have gone but
what for
It's awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore
