Verse
Things have come to a pretty pass
Our romance is growing flat,
For you like this and the other
While I go for this and that,
Goodness knows what the end will be
Oh I don't know where I'm at
It looks as if we two will never be one
Something must be done:


Chorus - 1
You say either and I say either, You say neither and I
say neither
Either, either Neither, neither, Let's call the whole
thing off.
 
You like potato and I like potahto, You like tomato
and I like tomahto
Potato, potahto, Tomato, tomahto, Let's call the whole
thing off
 
But oh, if we call the whole thing off Then we must
part
And oh, if we ever part, then that might break my
heart
 
So if you like pyjamas and I like pyjahmas, I'll wear
pyjamas and give up 
pyajahmas
For we know we need each other so we, Better call the
whole off off
Let's call the whole thing off.


Chorus - 2
You say laughter and I say larfter, You say after and
I say arfter
Laughter, larfter after arfter, Let's call the whole
thing off,
 
You like vanilla and I like vanella, You saspiralla,
and I saspirella
Vanilla vanella chocolate strawberry, Let's call the
whole thing off
 
But oh if we call the whole thing of then we must part
And oh, if we ever part, then that might break my
heart
 
So if you go for oysters and I go for ersters, I'll
order oysters and cancel 
the ersters
For we know we need each other so we, Better call the
calling off off,
Let's call the whole thing off.


Chorus - 3
I say father, and you say pater, I saw mother and you
say mater
Pater, mater Uncle, auntie, let's call the whole thing
off.
 
I like bananas and you like banahnahs, I say Havana
and I get Havahnah
Bananas, banahnahs Havana, Havahnah, Go your way, I'll
go mine
 
So if I go for scallops and you go for lobsters, So
all right no contest we'll 
order lobseter
For we know we need each other so we, Better call the
calling off off,
Let's call the whole thing off.
