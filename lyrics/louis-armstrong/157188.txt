Cold empty bed springs hurt my head
Feels like ole ned wished I was dead
What did I do to be so black and blue


Even the mouse ran from my house
They laugh at you and all that you do
What did I do to be so black and blue

I'm white inside but, that don't help my case
That's life can't hide what is in my face

How would it end ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue

How would it end I ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue
