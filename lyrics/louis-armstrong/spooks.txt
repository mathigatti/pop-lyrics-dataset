The other night about twelve o'clock
I thought I'd go downstairs just to check the lock
When I heard something in the house, I don't mean a mouse


I swear they were spooks, spooks, spooks
I know they were spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
I couldn't move just stood and stared, I never felt so scared

The first spook spoke and I heard him speak
He said, What say oh made the back door squeak?
Will you tease the cat and hound the puff and raise our spirits up

Oh Lord of them spooks, spooks, spooks
Those scary old spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
You don't have to take my word, but I heard what I heard

The next spook spoke he said 'spose we make
The fossil start to tick and make the shutters shake
You let me know just what you want "This is my favorite haunt"

Beware of them spooks, spooks, spooks
They're amidst of the spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
I hate spoofin, man I mean, that I've seen what I've seen

A big spook spoke he said Spike my son
He said I'll show you how to scare some fun
But next when you wail see here, You make it the loud and clear

Watch out for them spooks, spooks, spook of those nests
The old spooks, spooks, spooks loose
Maybe you don't think it so, but I know what I know

The last spook turned to his spouse and frowned
Said I thought I told you to wait in the ground
But you look awful cute tonight, in fact you look a-fright

He's talking about spooks, spooks, spooks
Real genuine spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
No used to putting up your dukes, you just can't fight a-them spooks

I'm getting out of here man, I don't dig this jive, no
Wait for us, wait for us, wait for us
