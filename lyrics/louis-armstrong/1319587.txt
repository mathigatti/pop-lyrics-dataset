The snow is snowing
The wind is blowing
But I can weather the storm
Why do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm


I can't remember
A worse December
Just watch those icicles from
Why do I care if icicles form
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat
Off with gloves
I need no overcoat
I'm burning with love

My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
Why do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm
