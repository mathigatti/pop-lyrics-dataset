Only you
Can make this world seem right
Only you
Can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone
Can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you
Baby only you
Can make this change in me
For its true
You're my destiny
And when you hold my hand I understand
The magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you


Oh only you
Can make this change in m
Baby, its so true
You are my destiny
When you hold my hand, I understand
The magic that you do
Baby you my dream come true and my one and only you
