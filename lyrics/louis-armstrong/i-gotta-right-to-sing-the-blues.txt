I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan inside
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down around the river
A certain man in this little town


Keeps draggin' my poor heart around
All I see for me is misery

I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan inside
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down around the river
A certain man in this little town

Soon that deep blue sea
Will be callin' me
It must be love say what you choose
I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to sing the blues

I gotta right to moan and cry
I gotta sit and sigh

Down around the river
Soon that deep blue sea
Will be callin' me

It must be love say what you choose
I gotta right to sing the blues

There's nothing left for me
I'm full of misery
I gotta right to sing the blues
