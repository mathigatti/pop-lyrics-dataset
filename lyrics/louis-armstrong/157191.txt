What good is sittin' alone in your room
Come hear the music play, yes
Life is a cabaret old chum
Come to the cabaret


Put down that knittin', the book and the broom
Time for a holiday, yes
Life is a cabaret old chum
So come to the cabaret

Come taste the wine, come hear that band
Yes, it's time for celebratin'
Right this way, your table's waitin'

No use permittin' a prophet of doom
Wipe every smile away, yes
Life is a cabaret old chum
So come to the cabaret, yes

Yes, life is a cabaret old chum
Only a cabaret old chum
So come to the cabaret
