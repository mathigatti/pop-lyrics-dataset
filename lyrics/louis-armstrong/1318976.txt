They ask me how I knew
My true love was true
I ofcourse reply
Something inside
Cannot be denied


They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realise
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them
And I gayly laughed
To think they could doubt
To think they could doubt my love

But today
My love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes

But today my love has flown away
I am without
I'm without my love

And now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
