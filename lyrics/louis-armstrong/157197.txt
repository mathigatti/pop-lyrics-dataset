Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?
Gosh oh, git up

Gosh oh, gee oh

Golly gee
When you turn them heaters on
Woe is me
Got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers, creepers
Where'd ya get them peepers
Oh, those weepers
How they hypnotize

Jeepers, creepers

Oh, those weepers

Where did your get those
Golly where'd your get those
Where did your get them there eyes?
