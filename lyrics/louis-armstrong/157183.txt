Come on and hear, come on and hear
Alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear, come on and hear
It's the best band in the land
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before
So natural that you wanna go to war
That's just the bestest band what am, oh honey lamb


Come on along, come on along
Let me take you by the hand
Up to the man, I said the man
Who's the leader of the band
If you care to hear that Swanee River played in ragtime
Come on and hear come on and hear
Alexander's ragtime band

Come on and hear, come on and hear
Alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear, come on and hear
It's the best band in the land
And if you want to hear that Swanee River played in ragtime
Come on and hear, come on and hear
Alexander's ragtime band
