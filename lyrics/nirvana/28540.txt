Portray sincerity
Act out of loyalty
Defend your free country
Wish away the pain
Hand out lobotomies
To save little families
Surrealistic fantasy
Bland boring plain!


Hold me down in restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is the whole fleece shun in master?
Don't feel guilty, master writing

Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know I can
Make enough of the words
For you to follow along
I sink and then some

Slippery pessimist
Hypocrite master
Conservative communist
Apocalyptic bastard
Thank you dear God
For putting me on this Earth
I feel very privileged
In debt for my thirst!

Hold me down in restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is the whole fleece shun in master?
Don't feel guilty, master writing

Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know I can
Make enough of the words
For you to follow along
I sink and then some
