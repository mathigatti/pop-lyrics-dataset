This is the end 
My only friend, the end 
This is the end 
My only friend, the end 


I'll offer you ? sexual, you can do anything 
I was walking through sex symbolism and a masculine man 

You can deface my grave my friend (You can rephrase my friend?) 

The killer woke up in Belgium 
And he poured a lot of syrup on his waffles 
And then he walked on down the hall 
And he said all I want is to have some hash browns and some grits 
And then he walked on down the hall 
And then he said listen I've got a quarter in my pocket 
And I see that waffle house jukebox 
And I'm gonna walk up to the coin slot 
And there's a direct line between my pupil and that coin slot 
And I lift that quarter out of my pocket 
And I said I wanna hear the waffle house theme 
So I walked up to the jukebox and I said 
Come on you (come on in?) 
I believe I will (I believe I will) 
Walk to the waffle house
