I'm not gonna make it through
Something else is something new
I'm not gonna make it dream
Suicide is something mean
I'm not gonna make it through
It's something else, it's something new
I'm not gonna make it through
It's something else, it's something new
Hold it in your gut


I'm not gonna make it through
Something else is something new
I'm not gonna make it scream
Suicide is something mean
I'm not gonna make it through
Something else, it's something new
I'm not gonna make it dream
In this house it's something mean

Hold it in your gut
