And if you say your prayers
You will make God happy
And if you do what's true
You will make me happy
I'll keep you in a jar
And you will seem happy
I'll give you breathing holes
You will think you're happy, now


You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room

And if you save yourself
You will make him happy
He'll bring you fine rewards
Then you will feel happy
I'll keep you in my room
I'm sure you'll be happy
And if you save your soul
You will think you're happy now

You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
