I'm long gone from vertical, somewhere south is stopping me
I'm long gone from the american dream, you may decide it's notfor me
I'm long gone but I'll let you through, you may decide it's notfor you.


I'm long gone but I'll let you through, you may decide there'snothing there
born in a junkyard
I'm long gone but I'll let you through, you may decide that it'snot good
I'm long gone but I'll let you leave, you may decide on stoppingme
I'm long gone but I'll let you through, you may decide it's notthat good
I'm long gone but I'll let you leave, you may decide on stoppingme.
born in a junkyard
gone
