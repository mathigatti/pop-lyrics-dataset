Hmm, I just wanna know, do you like me?

Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key


I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns

What is what I need
What is wrong with me
What is what I need

I'm nothing to do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bi-polar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke

I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns
Second-rate third degree burns

What is what I need
What is wrong with me
What do I think I think

Hate your enemies
Save, save your friends
Find, find your place
Speak, speak the truth

What is what I need
What is wrong with me
What is what I need
What do I think I think

Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key

What is wrong with me
What is what I need
What is wrong with me
What do I think I think
What is wrong with me
What is what I need
What do I think I think
