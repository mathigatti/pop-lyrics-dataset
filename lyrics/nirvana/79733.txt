Your life is shit
Shit
Your life is over
Bull
Your life is mine
Cry
Your life is hell
Hell
I'm gonna die
Dying with you just
I'm going to die
To wear my libido
I'm gonna try
To find it with you just
I'm gonna try
Do what they say


Your life is shit
Shit
Your life is strange
And insane
Your life is not the size of crap
Your life is now
Now

I'm gonna die
Dying with you just
I'm going to hell
Without my libido
I'm gonna try
To find it with you just
I'm going to hell
Without my libido
I'm gonna die
Dying with you just
I'm going to hell
Without my libido
I'm gonna try
To find it with you just
I'm gonna die
Do what they say

Your life is shit

"I'm gonna open myself up a flea market
I'm gonna open myself up a flea market
And you're gonna wish that you did
And retire on the profits
First off
I'm gonna empty out all of my Mrs. Butterworth jars
And I'm gonna put 'em on a shelf with my 800 dollar a month tax free Century 21 shop
And then I am going to put my Mrs. Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups I've accumulated over the past 62 years
Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood and cut them up into two by two piece squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap and I'm going to cut them into two by two piece squares and then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood
And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach and I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood
And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood and glue them onto the plywood and burlap
And sell em for lots of money
People will be paying top dollar for my kids new used new toys and clothing
Then maybe someday I can get rid of that piss stained mattress I've been sleeping on..."
