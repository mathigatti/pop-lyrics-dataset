When I looked you in the eye
I knew it was time for good-bye
You were the only one I had around
But you couldn`t keep your feet on the ground


Run rabbit run
But what`s that you`re runnin`for
Run rabbit run
You ain`t gonna run no more

Bye bye baby, bye bye bird!

Trought the cold sidewalk stones
Broke your little brittle bones
I know you were already dead
When the truck rolled over you head

Bye bye baby, bye bye bird!
