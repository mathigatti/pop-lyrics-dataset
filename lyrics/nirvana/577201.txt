Neither side is sacred
No one wants to win
Feeling so sedated
Think I'll just give in
Taking medication
Till our stomach's full
Neither side is sacred
Crawling in my hole


The grass is greener
Over here
You're the fog that
Keeps me clear
Re-inventing
What we knew
Take the time
And I'll be true
You're the reason
I feel pain
Feels so good to
Feel again

Neither side is sacred
No one wants to win
Feeling so sedated
But I can't give in
Taking medication
Till our stomach's full
Feelin' so sedated
When I'm in my home

The grass is greener
Over here
You're the fog that
Keeps it clear
Re-inventing
What we knew
Take the time
We will too
You're the reason
I feel pain
Feels so good to
Feel again

Oh

Neither side is sacred
No one wants to win
Feeling so sedated
But I just give in
Taking medication
Till our stomach's full
Feelin' so sedated
Crawling in my home

The grass is greener
Over here
You're the fog that
Keeps it clear
Re-inventing
What we knew
Learn from history
I will too
You're the reason
I feel pain
Feels so good to
Feel again

Oh
