We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend


Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago

Oh, no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched from form and land
For years and years I roamed

I gazed the gazeless stare
We walked a millions hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
