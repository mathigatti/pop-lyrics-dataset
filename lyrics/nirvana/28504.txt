What else should I be?
All apologies
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay
What else could I write?
I don't have the right
What else should I be?
All apologies


In the Sun
In the Sun I feel as one
In the Sun
In the Sun
Married, buried

I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezerburn
Choking on the ashes of her enemy

In the Sun
In the Sun I feel as one
In the Sun
In the Sun
Married, buried
Married, buried
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are

All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are

All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are

All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
