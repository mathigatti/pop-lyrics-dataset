Monkey see, monkey do -- I don't know why I
Walk around, follow you -- I don't know why I
Throw it out, keep it in -- I don't know why I
Have to have poison skin -- I don't know why I


Pay
Pay to play

Walk an inch, take a mile -- I don't know why I
Never faded, never smiled -- I don't know why I
Never mind, eat and run -- I don't know why I
Fuck your ass, for the fun -- I don't know why I

I don't know why I
Pay
Pay to play
