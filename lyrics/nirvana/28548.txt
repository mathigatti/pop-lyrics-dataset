May day, every day, my day
Could've had a heart attack, my heart
We don't know anything, my heart
We all want something fair, my heart


Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Out of town, out of sight, is my heart
Queen of lies, today, my heart
One more on the phone, my heart
One more at the door of my heart

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Mean heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart

Yeah

Uhh
