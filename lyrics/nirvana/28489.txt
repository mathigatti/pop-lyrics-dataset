(Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now)


When I was an alien
Cultures were not opinions

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait

Never met a wise man
If so it's a woman

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait

Just because you're paranoid
Don't mean they're not after you

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
