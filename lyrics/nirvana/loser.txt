She shoot through there after thunder ain't her pretty?
Wake me up and I feel hot do you understand?
Now I fallen through her decision she likes aaah
Leave me only up and come back to her trap


And I'm a loser and I need a little love
And I'm a loser and I need a little love
And I'm a loser and I need a little love
And I'm a loser and I need a little love

Judas thermal selection when what a lie
Blue is eating our special drum man (go to his bed)
looking through your lies
we recover while I'm in there what a lie

And I'm a loser and I need a little love
And I'm a loser and I need a little love
And I'm a loser and I need a little love
And I'm a loser and I need a little love

She shoot through there after thunder ain't her pretty?
Wake me up and I feel hot do you understand?
Now I fallen through her decision she likes aaah
Leave me only up and come back to her trap

And I'm a loser and I need a little love
And I'm a loser and I need a little love
And I'm a loser and I need a little love
And I'm a loser and I need a little love
