Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy


Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest, as a friend
As an old memory, yeah

Memory, yeah
Memory, yeah
Memory, yeah

Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memory, yeah

Memory, yeah
Memory, yeah
Memory, yeah

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

Memory, yeah
Memory, yeah
Memory, yeah
(No, I don't have a gun)

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

Memory, yeah
Memory, yeah
