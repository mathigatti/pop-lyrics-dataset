If I may
And if I might let me down weeping
And if I say what it's like
I might be dreaming


If I may what is right
Summer time, see me heal

Those years in his blonde head
And phrase from his pocket
And chains from the knowing
Life long dream

Dream
Dream
Do re mi
Do re mi

If I may and if I might
Wake me up and see me

If I do and if I lie
Find me out and see me

If I may cold as ice
I might have to see me heal

Raised in his own care
And phrase for this moment
The chains on his socket I will need

Dream
Dream
Don't rape me
Don't rape me
Don't rape me
Don't rape me

Wish me good
Wish me light
Find me out
Of season

On their way, just be quiet
Follow pain and read me
Yell r well if I sigh
Stake me out the TV

If I may, if I might
Go to gut to clean

And praise in his pocket
Rays from his warm lip
Chains from his owner
In my tea

Dream
Dream
Cremate me
Don't rape me
Don't rape me
Don't rape me
Don't rape me
Do re mi
