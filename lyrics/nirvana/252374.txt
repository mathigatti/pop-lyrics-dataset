Baby you're going down in the dark
Show my lonely night is fallen
And I don't have very long
Think my blood might boil
Within my face might burn
You're gonna make it better for a little while


Baby you're gonna die someday
See you in your crowded' wasted
When you start to fade
Then we'll start singing faster
I wouldn't wait so long
Won't get any easier in the dark

Oh yea
You will(x2)

Baby you're going down in the dark
Show my lonely night is fallen
And I don't have very long
Think my blood might boil
Within my face might burn
You're gonna make it better for a little while

Oh yea
You will(x2)
