Take a step outside yourself
And you turn around
Take a look at who you are
It's pretty scary


So silly
It's revolting
You're not much
If you're anything

Take a step outside the city
And you turn around
Take a look at where you are
It's revolting!

You're really nowhere
So wastefull
So foolish
Poppycock!

Who said don't look back?
Don't believe 'em
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant
'Cause they're gonna try and get behind you
Don't you let 'em do it
You know what I'm talking about?
You hear me talking?
You hear me talking?!

It's pretty scary, totally, it's so revolting
It's pretty scary, totally, it's so revolting
It's pretty scary, totally, it's so revolting
It's pretty scary, totally, it's so revolting
Naaah!

Take a step outside the country
And you turn around
Take a look at where you are
It's amazing

Take a good look
You're no big deal
You're so petty
It's a laugh

Take a step outside the planet
Turn around and around
Take a look at where you are
It's pretty scary
