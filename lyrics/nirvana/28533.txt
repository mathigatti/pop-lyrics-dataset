Bell on door clanks: Come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down chair, don't be afraid
Steaming hot towel on my face


I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved

Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see, I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip
Pee-pee pressed against my lips

I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed

I sense others in the room
Opey, Aunt Bee, I presume
They take turns in cut me up
I die smothered in Andy's butt

I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved
