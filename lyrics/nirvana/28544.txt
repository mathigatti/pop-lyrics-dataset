I was your mine, you were mine, my enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You were mine, I was once your ene.....aaaaaaah


You rang
Your ears rang

I was your mine, you were mine, my enemy,
You were mine, I was your, your enemy,
You were mine, I was your, your enemy,
You were mine, I was once your ene..aaaaaaaaahhh

At night, wishful goddess
At night, wish the hardest
At night, disco goddess
At night, we'll go gaaaaaaaaahhh!

I was your mine, you were mine, my enemy,
You were mine, I was your, your enemy,
You were mine, I was your, your enemy,
You were mine, I was once your ene ...

Wishful goddess, at night
Wish the hardest, at night
Wishful goddess, at night
Wishful gaaahhh!

I was your mine, you were mine, my enemy,
You were mine, I was your, your enemy,
You were mine, I was your, your enemy,
You were mine, I was once your ene!

At night, wishful goddess
At night, wish the hardest
At night, disco goddess
At night, you were so modest
At night, Crisco lovefest
At night, a mouthful on me
It's like, fish-filled garbage
At night, we'll go ... gaaahhh !!
