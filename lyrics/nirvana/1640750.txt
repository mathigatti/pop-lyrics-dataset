I will never walk it through
I could never promise you
It's some place I followed you
I will never wander through


This will mean I'll love again
Guess I'll never have a fan
This will mean me to me
I could never have a say

It's a never ending dream
I will always want to flee
If I'm me you'll never know
Everything I ever know

Dream
Dream
Dream
Dream

It's another point of view
Look at me when I was you
I could never die again
I won't lose another friend

She will see another me
When I'm through i'll meditate
Guess I'll know i'll medicate
Guess I'll fall and medicate

It's another opiate
But to me it's everything

Dream
Dream
Dream
Dream

Oh

I will never promise you
Dream
Dream
