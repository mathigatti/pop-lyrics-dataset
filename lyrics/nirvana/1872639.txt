Johnny was a homo
Kept his body clean
Moved to san francisco
Caught a big disease
Raped by his daddy
Johnny was at war
Living life unhappy
Covered up with salt


We're living in a time of change
Too many things you feel afraid
Do things against the will of god
Maybe someday soon they'll realize they're wrong

Lucy was a lesbian
Didn't make no sense
Moved to acapulco
Nothing goes in her hole
Then she met johnny
The dancing was informal
He and she got naughty
Found out that it's normal

We are living in a time of change
Too many things you feel afraid
Do things against the will of god
Maybe someday soon they'll realize they're wrong

Made not born
Made not born
Made not born
Made not born
Made not born
Made not born
