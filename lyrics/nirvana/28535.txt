In my eyes, I'm not lazy
In my face, it's not over
In your room, I'm not older
In your eyes, I'm not worth it


Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my, gimme back my, gimme back

Heal a million, kill a million
Heal a million, kill a million
Heal a million, kill a million

In my eyes, I'm not lazy
In my face, it's not over
In your room, I'm not older
In your eyes, I'm not worth it

Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my, gimme back my, gimme back

Heal a million, kill a million
Heal a million, kill a million
Heal a million, kill a million

In my eyes, I'm not lazy
In my face, it's not over
In your room, I'm not older
In your eyes, I'm not worth it

Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my, gimme back my, gimme back

Heal a million, kill a million
Heal a million, kill a million
Heal a million, kill a million
