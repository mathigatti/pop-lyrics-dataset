Afraid to grade
Wouldn't it be fun?
Cross, self-loss
Wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed
Wouldn't it be fun?
Some fear none
Wouldn't it be fun?

Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you

Smell the smell
Wouldn't it be fun
Search for a church
Wouldn't it be fun
Wet your bed
Wouldn't it be fun
Cold in gold
Wouldn't it be fun
