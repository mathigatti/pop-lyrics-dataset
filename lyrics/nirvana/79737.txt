Goodbye, my friend, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and i'll be there


Goodbye, papa, please, pray for me
i was the black sheep of the family
I don't know all these words
I have bought three turds
With my BB-gun I would kill birds

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time

All our lives, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the stars that we reached were just starfish on the beach

Goodbye, Michelle, my little one
I was the apple of the shining sun
And I have loved you every week
All my tears are salty
I think that now I will start to leave

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the stars that we reached where just starfish on the beach

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the stars that we reached where just starfish on the beach
