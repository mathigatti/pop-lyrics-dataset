It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To hear that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same


I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

In her false witness
Hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient
A display of patience
Disease-covered Puget sound
She'll come back as fire
To burn all the liars
Leave a blanket of ash on the ground

I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To know that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
