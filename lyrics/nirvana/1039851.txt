You're always dancing down the street
With your suede blue eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise
Here she comes again
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
She'll make you flip
Here she comes again
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
You kinda like the way she dips


She's my best friend's girl
She's my best friend's girl

And she used to be mine
You've got your nuclear boots
And your drip dry glove
And when you bite your lip
It's some reaction to love
