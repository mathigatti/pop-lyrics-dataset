I'm so happy
'Cause today I've found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly
But that's okay, 'cause so are you
We broke our mirrors


Sunday morning
Is everyday, for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles
In a daze, 'cause I've found God

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm so lonely
But that's okay, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad
And just maybe
I'm to blame for all I've heard
But I'm not sure

I'm so excited
I can't wait to meet you there
But I don't care
I'm so horny
But that's okay, my will is good

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I like it (I'm not gonna crack)
I miss you (I'm not gonna crack)
I love you (I'm not gonna crack)
I killed you (I'm not gonna crack)

I like it (I'm not gonna crack)
I miss you (I'm not gonna crack)
I love you (I'm not gonna crack)
I killed you (I'm not gonna crack)

I'm so happy
'Cause today I've found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly
But that's okay, 'cause so are you
We broke our mirrors

Sunday morning
Is everyday, for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze
'Cause I've found God

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I like it (I'm not gonna crack)
I miss you (I'm not gonna crack)
I love you (I'm not gonna crack)
I killed you (I'm not gonna crack)

I like it (I'm not gonna crack)
I miss you (I'm not gonna crack)
I love you (I'm not gonna crack)
I killed you (I'm not gonna crack)
