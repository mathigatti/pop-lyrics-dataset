Running nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill


In the someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that song?
In the someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that song?

Broken heart and broken bones
Finger pressing down to the horse pills
(Think about the guys in the hospitals)
One more quirky cliched phrase
You're the one I wanna refill
(You don't wanna wanna read them)

In the someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that song?
In the someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that song?

(Words are broken lives)
Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood screws, can make a child look like a deer.

In the someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that song?
In the someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that song?
Running nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill

In the someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that song?
In the someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that song?

In the some day
What's that sound
In the some day
What's that sound
In the some day
What's that sound
In the some day
What's that sound
