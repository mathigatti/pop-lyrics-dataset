"That's it"
Until my tensions
Feed me, I'm fucking hungry
Degrade me
I want my gun back


Like the fucking resume
Experience credentials
Experience the process
People freaking every day
White lights
Sitting inside
And you get sicker then you get a little better
Then a

Blasphemy

Hold me, I'm so pathetic
And study, all the sudden
Baby, suddenly find her
Daddy, exploring only

Like the fucking resume
Experience credentials
Experience the process
People freaking every day
White lights
Sitting inside
And you get sicker then you get a little better
Hold me
Until my tensions degrade me
I'm fucking hungry
Feed me, the wells of comfort
Exume me
I want my complex back

A wicked man
Picked off the scabs and fed them
To the pigeons
Help him, he is so cornered
Kill him, your mercy whore will

Like the fucking resume
Experience potentials
Experience the process
People freaking every day
White lights really inside
And you get sicker than ahhhhhhh
Help me, fucking hoses
Help me, until my tensions
Praise me, I'm really hungry
Degrade me, I want my complex back

"Thank you and, good night"
