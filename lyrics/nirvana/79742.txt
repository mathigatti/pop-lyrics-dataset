Lesser God, loathe me
Lesser God, you're lonely
Lesser God, loathe me


You get, you get, you get, you get to me
Holy is the time, it's such an easy way to go
You get, you get, you get, you get to be
Hide the struggle in the skin under a fingernail

Lesser God, loathe me
Lesser God, you're lonely
Lesser God, loathe me
Lesser God, you're lonely

Waste your time by saving worthless gullibles
Kill a politician and then wear his clothes
This decade is the age of rehashing
Protest and then go to jail for trespassing

To me it's insane
Go home, go
