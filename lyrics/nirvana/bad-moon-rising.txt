I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today


Don't go 'round tonight
It's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a blowin'
I know the end is commin' soon
I fear rivers over flowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we'er in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
