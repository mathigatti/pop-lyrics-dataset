Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch


It isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
I've got some rope, you have been told
I promise you, I have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asks me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

It isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
I've got some rope, you have been told
I promise you, I have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

Polly said

Polly says her back hurts
And she's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me the will of instinct

It isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
I've got some rope, you have been told
I promise you, I have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
