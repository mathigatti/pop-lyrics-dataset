One baby to another says: I'm lucky I've met you
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
A travel through a tube and end up in your infection


Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

With eyes so dilated I've become your pupil
You've taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

You
You
You
You
You

One baby to another says: I'm lucky I've met you
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
A travel through a tube and end up in your infection

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
Sloppy, lips to lips
You're my vitamins
I like you
