It's an odd alliance
It's another light I say
What alone tonight
Even if my eyes
Even have some time
Bet it all tonight


Listen I have been banging away
Even if you had a sight

It's mad enough tonight
And forests have never grown
It's another light
And I can never have mine

It's not mine
It's not mine

I've been here for my friends
I never know if I said

My milk is your shit
It's hard and boiled
And sour all again
My milk is your shit

Cause it's biting out what would

My milk is your shit
My milk is piss
Don't you love that I can bite
