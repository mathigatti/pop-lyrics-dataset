There's a soft relentless mountains
Glisten in the light of the trees
All the flowers have gingivitis
And the birds cry happily
We're to be together once again my love
I need you back, oh baby baby


I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you'll only break my heart
I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it I can shape it, I can mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it, beat it, masturbate it

I been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same old
City boy won't you spank off
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could
