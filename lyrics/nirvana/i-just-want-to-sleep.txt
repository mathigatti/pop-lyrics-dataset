So many hours gone
You know, you won
I could say that I'm afraid
But tonight I will try to forget


I cannot sleep
I can't even try
I know that I will lose this daily fight
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
I just want to sleep!
Don't you hate me if I need you
'Cause I don't know what to do
I'm confused about use it
Well, I lost for you two

I cannot sleep
I can't even try
I know that I will lose this daily fight
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
I just want to sleep!
So many hours gone
You know, you won
I could say that I'm affraid
But tonight I will try to forget that

I cannot sleep
I can't even try
I know that I will lose this daily fight
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
I just want to sleep
