This song is about mountains
Glisten in the light of the trees
All the flowers sing in D minor
And the birds fly happily
We'll be together once again my love
I need you back oh baby baby


I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you'll only break my heart

I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it, Shape it, Mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
Spank it, Beat while you wait

I've been looking for Day Glo
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could

I can feel it, I can hold it
Bend it, Shape it, Mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
Spank it, Beat while you wait

I've been looking for Day Glo
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could

I've been looking for Day Glo
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever
You wouldn't think it ever could
