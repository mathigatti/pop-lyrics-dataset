I'm buried up to my neck in
Contradictorary lies
I'll take pride as the king of iliterature
I'm very ape and very nice


If you ever need anything please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm so busy acting like I'm not naive
I've seen it all, I was here first

Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out out the sky
Into the dirt

If you ever need anything please don't

Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out out the sky
Into the dirt
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out out the sky
