Blew your lace
uh as you darn into
uh as you love me, poise you
lady our lakes are blushing by your hate!


I was yours and guilty
if you lift the jewelries
special time as you can be
too much of this parade

uuh... ooh... hey... ooh...

I was yours and not sure
you had done into
you got me into endorcy
your legs are ignorate

I was your intention
or a drop dead
wish you got me, on the river
that's where lunch is, lunch is paid

uuh... ooh... uuh... ooh...
