I can't hide, no
On the mantle
I'm not sad
Until I'm home
It's the season
I'm all reason
I have seen
All I have grown


Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
And not seen
At the seams

I'm a lender
I'm a planter
I put something
In the garden

In the handle
On the mantle
I met Santa
I met God

I'm a lady
Can you save me?
It's the sulfur
I have grown

'Tis the season
I'm all reason
I have fleas
So run on home
