Shooting! Get the blast!
Raiding! grandma's garage
Selling! personal possessions for pot
Hawks, my daddy, favorite gold plated watch


Stripping the foreskin from my bones
Scrubbing my nerves with wire brush
Massive intentions, fluid frost
Animal intentions into my knots

Bambi Slaughter ain't the same as killing humans
Bambi Slaughter ain't the same as killing humans
Bambi Slaughter ain't the same as killing humans
Spit the wave, like I've been awhile

Looking! the medicine cabinet for drugs
Stealing! tobacco from grocery stores
Scamming! tapes from my trustworthy friends
Humm just need planning, pretty little houses to rob.
