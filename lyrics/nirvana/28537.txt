Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mighty wisdom
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud


Show me how you question, question
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and give it cleaning
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud

Is he in an easychair?
Poop as hard as a rock
I don't like you anyway
Silly little fucks

I'm who?
I'm you

Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mighty wisdom
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud

Show me how you question, question
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and give it cleaning
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud

Is he in an easychair?
Poop as hard as a rock
I don't like you anyway
Seal it in a box

I'm who?
I'm you

I'm who?
I'm you
