I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
Mind, don't have a mind
Get away, get away, get away, get away
Away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
Afraid, ghost


Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three
