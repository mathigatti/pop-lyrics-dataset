One more day to complete my service
One more high to decay my nervous
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way
It's over


One more day to complete my service
One more time here to fade my servant
One more day if I find a way
Over

She seemed to read minds
And I know a later time
We could make it with you
Leave the soul

Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age

One more day to complain my servant
One more doubt here to find a servant
One more time here if I find a way
It's over

Wondering how I'm here date my cover
One more doubt here to save my never
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way
It's over

She seemed to read minds
And I know a later time
We could make it with you
Leave the soul

Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age

Just you need
And read
You're freak
And knew
You read
You flew

One more day to conplete my circuit
One more high here to find my nervous
Someday I'm gonna find a way
It's over

One more doubt here to claim my supper
I can have anything you want to
One more day if I find a way
It's over

She seemed to read minds
And I know we were out of time
Breathe the way here with you
Dream the same on the dew
Breathe the same on her
Take a moan on a man
Breathe the shame on you
Breathe the lie

Old age
Old age
Old age
