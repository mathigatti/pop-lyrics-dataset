Yes she is my skinhead girl
Yes she is my skinhead
Yes she is my skinhead girl
Yes she is my little pet

I'm fuckin all set to beat you
Keep keepin' all the lovely faces
Mathematic I'm a over and I'll race it
Stop sulking and I ought to trace it

Yes she is my skinhead girl
Yes she is my skinhead
Yes she is my skinhead girl
Checkinist girl this girl is world
Yaaahhh!!!
Ah
Aaahhh!!

I'll tell you what's good to look now
Can all it be impossible
When a villain in the face of God
On a Sunday

And I feel like a motivation
I'm on a mission to kill myself

Yes she is my skinhead girl
Yes she is my skinhead
Yes she is my skinhead girl
Checkinist girl this girl is (my) world
Yes she is my skinhead girl
She's gonna take me for a whirl
Yes she is my skinhead girl
Yes she is my little pet

Make ready for affection
But I met my love
