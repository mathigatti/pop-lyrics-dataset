Polly wants a cracker 
I think I should get off her first 
Maybe think she wants some water 
To put out the blow torch 
It isn't me 
We have some seed 
Let me clip 
Your dirty wings 
Let me take a ride 
Don't hurt yourself 
I want some help 
To please myself 
I've got some rope 
Haven't told 
I promise you 
I have been true 
Let me take a ride 
Don't hurt yourself 
I want some help 
To please myself 
Polly wants a cracker 
Maybe she would like more food 
She asks me to untie her 
A chase would be nice for a few 
Polly said 
Polly says her back hurts 
And she's just as bored as me 
She caught me off my guard 
It amazes me, the will of instinct
