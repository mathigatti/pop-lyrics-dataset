All the itchy flakes, it is a flaming
All the gels and cremes it is pertaining
To a fungus mold cured by injection
Hope it's only, ah, a yeast infection


Oh, well, it burns when I
It hurts when I pee
Oh, well, it hurts when I
It hurts when I see

Now I vomit cum and diarrhoea
On the tile floor like oatmeal pizza
Fill my toilet bowl full of a cloudy
Puss, I feel the blood becoming chowder rust

Oh, well, it burns when I
It hurts when I pee
Oh, well, it hurts when I
It hurts when I see

Roll into my bed which does consist of
Lice, bugs and fleas and yellow mucus
Stained dirt, vaseline, Toe Jam and Booger
Stomach acid worms that dance in sugared sludge

Hmm
