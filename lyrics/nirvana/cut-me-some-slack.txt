Dear mama, set me free
Hey mama, let me be
Mama, watch me run
Mama, I wanna have some fun (yeah)


Hey mama, let me down
I said mother, I want to go to town

If you want me to stick around you’ve got to cut me some slack
I’m gonna hear the woman yet never come back

If you want me to stick around you’ve got to cut me some slack
I'm gonna hear the woman yet never come back

Wooo, Wooo, Wooo, Woo

Oh Mama, let me be
Mother, mom, set me free
Mama-mama-mama, watch me run
Mama watch me run
Oh, Mama, I just want to have some fun
Yeah, set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Woooooo
