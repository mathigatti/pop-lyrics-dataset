I'm going to Hollywood
They'll know I'm so good
And you'll know how I fell
And I'll get to fuck Brooke Shields


But I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in

I wanna be a star
I'm going to have a car
And you'll have to admit
I'll be rich as shit

But I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in

But I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in

I would've give you some
If you only would've treated me nice
And you'll expect you did
And you'll feel pretty stupid

But I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in

But I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in
