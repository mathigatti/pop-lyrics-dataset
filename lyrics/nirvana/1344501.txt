When I have a hand
When I have a hand
When I need undressed
From all that I've had
I know that I've had
Comin' to her sin
When I know I've had
Lend a helpin' hand
And I'll help herself


When I ya
When I ya
When I ya
When I ya
When I ya
When I ya

When I know I'm there
When I smell her stare
I know no one breathe
Send my soul right there
Sell my soul right there
And I'll know I'll be
From all that I have
When I know I have
When I have a plan

When I ya
When I ya
When I ya
Tonight ya
Tonight ya
Tonight ya
