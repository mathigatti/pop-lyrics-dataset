She says she's changed
She says she's cured
She says she's mine


Bull...bull...

Come over here for a second
I want you to see something
Why is this happening to me?
Why is this real?

The sound of dentage and I know
The sound of dentage and I see
It's come to get me and I hope
The sound of ??? is mine

She says she's changed
She says she's cured
She says she's mine

Bull...bull

Come over here for a second
I want you to see something
Whe is this happening to me?
Why is this real?

The sound of dentage and I know
The sound of dentage and I see
It's come to get me and I hope
The crafty bullet is mine

Had to throw up all day
Like to make experiments
Like to go and stock thee boiled carcass on my legs

Listen to me, to me
Listen to me, to me
Listen to me, to me

Come over here for a second
I want you to see something
Why is this happening to me?
Why is this real?

The sound of vengeance and I know
The sound of dentage and I see
It's come to get me and I know
The sound vengeance is mine

Is mine... is mine... is mine...
Is mine...
