They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me
One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me


They whooped him up the hill
They whooped him up the hill for me

One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They whooped him up the hill for me

They never said among them would
They never said among them would for me

One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me

They bit him in the side
They bit him in the side for me

One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me

They hung his head and died
We hung his head and died for me

One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me
