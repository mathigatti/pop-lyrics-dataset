I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do, think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue


I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free, I do

I'm standing in your line
I do, hope you have the time
I do, pick a number too
I do, keep a date with you

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free, I do

I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do, think you fit this shoe
I do, won't you have a clue

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
No I can see you every night
Free

I do, I do, I do, I do
