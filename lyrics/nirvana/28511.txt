If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do


I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news

Would you like to hear my voice
Sweetened with emotion
Invented at your birth?

I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
And store it deep inside of me

If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do

I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But thats old news

Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth?

I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
And store it deep inside me
I formulate infinity
And store it deep inside me
