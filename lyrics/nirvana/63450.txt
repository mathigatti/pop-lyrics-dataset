I will never bother you
I will never promise too
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never spoke a word again
I will crawl away for good


I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Hey
Hey
Hey
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right

I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Lets talk about someone else
Steaming soup against her mouth
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love herself

I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew it'd come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right

You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right

You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right

You know you're right
You know you're right
You know your rights
You know your rights
You know your rights

Hey
