To hope is admittance 
Feed before beginning 
Double-sided cynics 
Reflected images 
Don't be so selfish 
Leaving the image 
Follow it far 
To find where you are 
You haven't grown 
Go on alone 


Never finished his sentence 
Remained in seclusion 
For the next few days 
Family is circuling 
He having moved up 
All the styles of heresy 
Finally he appeared unexpectedly 
Looking for company
