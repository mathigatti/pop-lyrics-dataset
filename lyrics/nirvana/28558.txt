What's the season of love if you can't have everything
What's the reason of love if you can lose everything
What's the meaning of love, it's a crime if anything
What's the meaning of love, it's a crime, it's a crime


How can a culture can forget it's plan of yesterday
And you swear it's not a trend, doesn't matter anyways
Barely heat the top of friend like it moves everyday
You could shit upon the stage, they'll be fans

All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly.
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, doesn't matter anyway

All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, doesn't matter anyway
