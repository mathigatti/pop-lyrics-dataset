I'm long gone from vertical, somewhere south is stopping me
I'm long gone from the american dream , you may decide it's not for me
I'm long gone but I'll let you through, you may decide it's not for you.
I'm long gone but I'll let you through, 
you may decide there's nothing there 
born in a junkyard-4x
I'm long gone but I'll let you through, you may decide that it's not good
I'm long gone but I'll let you leave, you may decide on stopping me
I'm long gone but I'll let you through, you may decide it's not that good
I'm long gone but I'll let you leave, you may decide on stopping me.
