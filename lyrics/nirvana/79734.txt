That is the way you want it
You wanted it to be the way you like it
I`m no lover
We wanted you to see it the way you wanted
It's all right
I could be crazy


But I could be human
I never wanted to open your eyes
I could be crazy
But I could be human
I never wanted to

I`m no lover
You wanted to be living up in the air, yeah
I`m no lover
But please let go of the human
That`s me
