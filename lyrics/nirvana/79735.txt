This is a hard, cold beat
You can go dance if you like
You won't get in trouble
And the tea has some spice
You wanna know it hits ya
You can make, have some fun
Watching them make you away
Up on the wall you won't
Aaaaah


What's in the wait, your waiter
We only ate your garnish
I ordered spam and rice
In this to say you're fired
We dance on the table tops
We only had your daughter
We ordered too many cocktails
What's in the way you love
