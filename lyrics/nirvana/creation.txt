Creation

Hey, the love of two
A desire, is what for you
It is real? A lullaby
Face to face, with an unnamed mouth


Hey, hey, heyyyy
Hey, hey, heyyyy

Feel the spirit form
In his eyes was loving for
And his lion's were raging high
Hunts himself and fears hip ripe

Hey, hey, heyyyy
Hey, hey, heyyyy

Heyyyyyyyyyyyyy
