Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at grandpa joe's
I kicked and screamed, said: Please, don't go


Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatos and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good

Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

Said: Why don't you stop your crying
Go outside and ride your bike?
That's what I did, I killed my toe

Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms

Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Wanna be alone!
