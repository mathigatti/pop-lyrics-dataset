Come out and play
Make up the rules
I know, I hope, the tide is blue
Though some are dead
I'll walk from you
I know, I'll light
The way to go


Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello

I'm a liar and I'm famous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stuped and contagious
Here we are now, segregate us
A libido, an albino
A mulato, a mosquito
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stuped and we're famous

Yeah!
Hey!

Come out and play
Make up the rules
I know, I hope, to find the truth
We're wide awake and heavy feeling
We'll go outside and pray for me

Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello

I'm a liar and I'm famous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stuped and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
An albino,a mulato
A libido, a mosquito
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stuped and famous

Yeah!
Hey!

Come out and play
Take off your clothes
Make up the rules
I'll see you in court
And I will not embrace you
I'm now a lie, the same as you

Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello

I'm a lazy and famous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stuped and we're famous
Here we are now, entertain us
A libido, an albino
A mosquito, a vagina
Here we are now, entertain us
We feel stuped and famous

A denial!
