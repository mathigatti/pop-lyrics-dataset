Monkey see, monkey do
(I don't know why)
I'd rather be dead than cool
(I don't know why)
Every line ends in rhyme
(I don't know why)
Less is more, love is blind
(I don't know why)


Stay, Stay away
Stay away
Stay away

Give an inch, take a smile
(I don't know why)
Fashion shits, fashion style
(I don't know why)
Throw it out and keep it in
(I don't know why)
Have to have poison skin
(I don't know why)

Stay, Stay away
Stay away
Stay away

I don't know why
I don't know why

Stay, Stay
Stay away
Stay away

Monkey see, monkey do
(I don't know why)
I'd rather be dead than cool
(I don't know why)
Every line ends in rhyme
(I don't know why)
Less is more, love is blind
(I don't know why)

Stay, Stay away
Stay away
Stay away

Stay, Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
God is gay
