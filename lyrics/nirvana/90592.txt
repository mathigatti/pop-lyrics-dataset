Look your legs are ashes
Charred into a special
Don't make noise, you break
Your legs are eyes and all
You're right


I was your incompetent
Man just read the furies
Special time but you can't
Make too much of him

Gray

I was yours and closer
Your were them in New York
Got me in, to enter
See your legs are in your legs

I was your end dancer
More than all I wish you
Got me under with the
Nice, nice, nice religious man
