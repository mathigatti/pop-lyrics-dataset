You've got it, wish I had your life
Yes, it's a blessing in disguise. You
Sometimes I wish I had your life
What the fuck I loved this life for you


I missed and if that's true
Know that I loved you,
flying in the skies with you and than
The only way I like it, the only way i take this,
its the only way I like it , the only reason why I take this
What do you have or do you want a lesser evil over?
Hold, and I will try just to be fucked, that is my excuse
That is my excuse
That is my excuse

What do you live, am I alive?
Can we be true this time around?
She was a whore and I'm her king
Do you want or do you have?
Do you want or do you have?
Do you want or do you have?
Do you want or do you
No time for you, just for myself
Nothing left but to be impressed
It sad if we were freedom spell
I love this name I love this pain
Love this name I love this pain
Love this name I love this pain

So save yourself, tell me are for real?
Is that your name you once held?
And just an innocence for you
That's past and future's talking about you
That's the past we are talking about the future
That's the past we'll take it in the future

What do you have or do you want?
A lesser evil or a hole?
I would die just to be taught so now that is my excuse
That is my excuse
That is my excuse
That is my excuse
What do you live? Am I alive?
Could be true this time around, she's a whore and I'm her king
Do you want or do you have?
Do you want or do you have?
Do you want or do you have?

Long time for you I fought myself,
I have nothing left but to be impressed
That, if we could freedom spare,
I love this name I feel this pain
I love this name I love the pain
I love this name I love this pain
I love this name I love it
