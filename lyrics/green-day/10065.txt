I'm on a sentimental journey
into sight and sound
of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the
war that's in my mind
leaving in the lurch
and I'm taking back what's mine


I'm on a mission
into destination unknown
an expedition
in the desolation road
where am I

Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I'm on my own
Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I'm on my own
Lost and found, trouble bound
Castaway

I'm riding on a night train and
driving stolen cars
testing my nerves out on the boulevard
spontaneous combustion in the
corners of my mind
leaving in the lurch
and I'm taking back what's mine

I'm on a mission
into destination unknown
an expedition
in the desolation road
where am I

Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I'm on my own
Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I'm on my own
Lost and found, trouble bound
Castaway

I'm on a sentimental journey
into sight and sound
of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the
war that's in my mind
leaving in the lurch
and I'm taking back what's mine

I'm on a mission
into destination unknown
an expedition
in the desolation road
where am I

Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I'm on my own
Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I'm on my own
Lost and found, trouble bound
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
