Scream, with your hands up in the sky
Like you want to testify
For the life that's been deleted
Sing, like a rebel's lullaby
Under the stars and stripes
For the lost souls that were cheated
We will be seen, but not be heard


We are Revolution Radio
Operation No Control
And the headline: My love's bullet proof
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline: Legalize the truth

Give me rage, like thereâ€™s teargas in the crowd
Do you want to live out loud?
But the air is barely breathing
Rise, of the slums to the obsolete
The dawn of the new airwaves
For the anti-social media

We are Revolution Radio
Operation No Control
And the headline: My love's bullet proof
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline: Legalize the truth

We will be seen but not be heard
We are the songs of the disturbed

We are Revolution Radio
Operation No Control
And the headline: My love's bullet proof
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline: Legalize the truth
