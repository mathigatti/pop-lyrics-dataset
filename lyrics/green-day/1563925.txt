She is my drama queen
She is so wet and reckless
She is my drama queen
She dangles from her necklace


Refr√£o
Daddy's little bundle of joy
Out of a magazine
Everyone's drama queen
Is old enough to bleed now

She is my drama queen
Her life is now unfolding
There goes my drama queen
What do you think she's holding?
Hey little drama queen
Did you find your savior?
Oh little drama queen
You better call a lawyer

Daddy's little bundle of joy
Out of a magazine
Everyone's drama queen
Is old enough to bleed now

Hey little drama queen
From New York to San Francisco
Everyone's drama queen
I think she's going psycho

Daddy's little bundle of joy
Out of a magazine
Everyone's drama queen
Is old enough to bleed now

She's old enough to bleed now
She's old enough to bleed now
