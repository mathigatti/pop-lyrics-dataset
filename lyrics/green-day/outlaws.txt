Life after youth
Faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love
First forgiveness
We were delinquents
Freaks of a faded memory


Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
The outlaws of forever

Scars, broken hearts
Breaking in cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls
Bottle rockets
All that we wanted
It's for our life beyond the stars

Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever, baby

I got no supervision
Nothing will change my spirits
Race around with my innocence
I'll plead my innocence
But that's my best defense
When you are young

Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
The outlaws of forever

I found a knife by the railroad track
You took a train and you can't go back
Forever now, forever now, you'll roam
