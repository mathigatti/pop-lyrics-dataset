She's an extraordinary girl
In an ordinary world
And she can't seem to get away


He lacks the courage in his mind
Like a child left behind
Like a pet left in the rain

She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying


She sees the mirror of herself
An image she wants to sell
To anyone willing to buy

He steals the image in her kiss
From her hearts apocalypse
From the one called whatsername

She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying

She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
Some days he's not worth trying
Now that they both are finding,
She gets so sick of crying

She's an extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
