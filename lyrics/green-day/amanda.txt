Amanda, don't you know?
That I still walk around
It's foggy round about
When I get back in town


I was a different man
From 5 seconds ago
And you're a different woman, that's for certain
I don't know a thing about

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand?
Amanda
I couldn't be your man

Amanda, don't you know?
I wasn't strong enough
And in your wild mind
I wasn't smart enough

I was a different kid
From 15 years ago
And you're a different woman, that's for certain
And I wanna know about

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand?
Amanda
I couldn't be your man

I'm not playing with your mind
Unless you think I am
Cause you were crushing my heart
Like a bad yearning round

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand?
Amanda
I couldn't be your man
