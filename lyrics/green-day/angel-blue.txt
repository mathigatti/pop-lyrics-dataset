Gonna build it up just to burn it down
You're a princess, I'm a fucking clown
Stop the presses cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine


You're just a fucking kid
And no one ever gives you a break
You want a senorita
And now your heart is gonna break

(Refrão)
You're angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Now I'm singing out the alphabet
Averages of putting about my cigarette

We're hit the cemetery so we can see the holiday lights
Waking up the dead and everything'll be alright

(Refrão)
You're angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces

Alright
Stuck in the middle of heaven and hell
Alright
Trying to find my better angels

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Stop the presses cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine

You're just a fucking kid
And no one ever gives you a break
You want a senorita
And now your heart is gonna break

(Refrão)
You're angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces
