3AM, I'm drunk again
My head is standing underneath my puke
So make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off
Sedatives and dizzy spells
And smelling like a salad in my puke
So make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop I'm getting off


Well, slipped into a coma once again
Where's my organ donor?
Lend a hand

So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate

One night stands and cheap regrets
I take another drag off of my cigarette
So stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off
One last stop for one track mind
Just give me shelter, give me give me something
Make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off

Well, slipped into a coma once again
Where's my organ donor?
Lend a hand

So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate

So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate
