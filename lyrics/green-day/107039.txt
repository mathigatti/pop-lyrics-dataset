Wake up, the house is on fire,
And the cat's caught in the dryer,
Philosophy is a liar, when
Your home is your headstone,
"Icon" is the last chance for hope,
When there's no such things as heroes,
Your faith lies in the ditch that
You dug yourself in,


Last chance to piss it all away,
Nothing but hell to pay,
When the lights are going down,

Deabeat holiday, celebrate your own decay,
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high,
On a noose over your home,

Deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray,
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high,
But at least you're not alone,

Christmas lights in the middle of august,
Grudges come back to haunt us,
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies,
Grounded in a duplex to find that,
You're living on a landmine
Vacation hotspots is a cemitery drive,

Last chance to piss it all away,
Nothing but hell to pay,
When the lights are going down,

Deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay,
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high,
On a noose over your home,

Deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray,
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high,
But at least you're not alone,

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay when all you
Want to do... Is not to...give up!
