Don't wanna be an american idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind fuck America


Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well maybe I am the faggot America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda!
And sing along in the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be OK
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Don't want to be an american idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
Calling out to Idiot America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
