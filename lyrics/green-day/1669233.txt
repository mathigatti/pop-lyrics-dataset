Words get trapped in my mind
Sorry I don't take the time to feel the way I do
'Cause the first day you came into my life
My time ticks around you
But then I need your voice
As the key to unlock all the love that's trapped in me
So tell me when it's time to say I love you


All I want is you to understand
That when I take your hand
It's 'cause I want to
We are all born in a world of doubt
But there's no doubt
I figured out
I love you

All I want is you to understand
That when I take your hand
It's 'cause I want to
We are all born in a world of doubt
And there's no doubt
I figured out
I love you

And I feel lonely for
All the losers that will never take the time to say
What was really on their mind instead
They just hide away
Yet they'll never have
Someone like you to guard them
And help along the way
Or tell them when it's time to say I love you
So tell me when it's time to say I love you
