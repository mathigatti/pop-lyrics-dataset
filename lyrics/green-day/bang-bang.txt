(This is definitely not the first video
To surface of an execution of men
They claimed responsibility for the executions
Described as severely mentally disturbed
Videos show another hostage executed
By the terrorist group
Deserve to be annihilated)


I get my kicks and I want to start a rager
I want to dance like I'm on the video
I got a fever for the violent behavior
I'm sweating bullets like a modern Romeo

(Bang, bang, give me fame)
Shoot me up to entertain
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
(You're dead, I'm well fed)
Give me death or give me head
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier

I testify like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live and it's on my radio
I got my photobomb, I got my Vietnam
I love a lie just like anybody else

(Bang, bang, give me fame)
Shoot me up to entertain
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
(You're dead, I'm well fed)
Give me death or give me head
Broadcasting from my room and playing with my toys

I wanna be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hurrah (bang, bang), hurrah (bang, bang)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier

I wanna be like the soldiers on the screen
It's my private Holy War
Oh, baby, baby, this is Viva Vendetta
Oh, this is love or it's World War Zero

I wanna be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hurrah (bang, bang), hurrah (bang, bang)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier

I wanna be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hurrah (bang, bang), hurrah (bang, bang)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier
