I'm rotting inside
My flesh turns to dust
Whisper, are you dying??in my ear


I'm so sick to death
Tumors in my head
Whisper, are you dying??in my ear

Black rose of death
In my fist I clutch
Thorns shred my finger tips
And drips toxic blood

Kiss me one last time
Wipe off my sweat
Whisper, are you dying??in my ear

As my bones they rust
20 pounds of trust
Whisper, are you dying??in my ear

Black rose of death
In my fist I clutch
Thorns shred my finger tips
And drips toxic blood

I'm rotting inside
My flesh turns to dust
Whisper, are you dying??in my ear

Kiss me one last time
Wipe off my sweat
Whisper, are you dying??in my ear
Whisper, are you dying??in my ear
