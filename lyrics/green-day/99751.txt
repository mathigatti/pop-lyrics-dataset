As I stepped to the edge
of the shadow of a doubt
With my conscience beating
Like the pulse of a drum
That hammers on and on
Until I reach the break of day
when the sun beats down
on The halfway house
as my conscience beating
The sound in my ear
The will that persevere
As I reach the break of day


When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskates and the losers
Nothing's left to cling onto
You gotta hold on, onto yourself

A cry of hope
A plea for peace
And my conscience beating
It's not what I want for
It's all that I need
To reach the break of Day
So I run to the edge
of the shadows of a doubt
With my conscience bleeding
Here lies the truth
The lost treasures of my youth
As I hold on to the break of day

When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskates and the losers
Nothing's left to cling onto
You gotta hold on, onto yourself

When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskates and the losers
Nothing's left to cling onto
You gotta hold on, gotta hold on, hold on onto yourself.
