So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
(repeat)


I was a lonely soul
I had nobody till I met you
But you, keeping me waiting, all of the time
What can I do?

It's your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep me waiting
Please don't keep me waiting

Cuz I'm so tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
(repeat)
