Boxed up all her favorite things sold the rest at a rainy yard sale
Big plans and leaving friends and a westbound sign
Weighed out her choices on a scale prevailing nothing made sense
Just transportation and a blank decision
She's taking off


No time and no copping out she's burning daylight and petrol
Blacked out the rearview mirror heading westward on
Strung out on confusion road and ten minute nervous breakdowns
Xanex a beer for thought and she determined
She's taking off

Is it salvation or an escape from discontent
Will she find her name in the California cement
Punched out of the grind that punched her one too many times
Is tragedy 2000 miles away
She's taking off
