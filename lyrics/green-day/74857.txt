Somebody keep my balance
I think I'm falling off
Into a state of regression
The expiration date
Rapidly coming up
It's leaving me behind to rank


Always move forward
Going straight will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

I'm taking one step sideways
Leading with my crutch
Got a freaked up equilibrium
Count down from 9 to 5
Hooray! We're gonna die!
Blessed into our extinction

Always move forward
Going "straight" will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

Always move forward
Going straight will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
