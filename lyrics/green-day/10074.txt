I've been waiting a long time
For this moment to come
I'm destined
For anything at all
Downtown lights will be shining
On me like a new diamond
Ring out under the midnight hour
No one can touch me now
And I can't turn my back
It's too late ready or not at all


I'm so much closer than
I have ever known
Wake up

Dawning of a new era
Calling
Don't let it catch you falling
Ready or not at all
So close
Enough to taste it
Almost I can embrace this feeling
On the tip of my tongue

I'm so much closer than
I have ever known
Wake up
Better thank your luck stars

I've been waiting a lifetime
For this moment to come
I'm destined for anything at all

Dumbstruck
Colour me stupid
Good luck
You're gonna need it
Where I'm going if I get there
At all

Wake up
Better thank your luck stars
