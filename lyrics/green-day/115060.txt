I wonder down these streets all by myself
Think of my future now
I just don't know
I don't seem to care
I stop to notice that
I'm by your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there


Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sight
And through my veins temptation flows
Whoa hoa...
Out here...

So I sit down here on the hard concrete
Think of my future now
I just don't know
I don't seem to care
So I sit across the street from your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there

Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sight
And through my veins temptation flows
Whoa hoa...
Out here...

Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sight
And through my veins temptation flows
Whoa hoa...
Out here...
