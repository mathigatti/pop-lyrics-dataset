Turn it inside out so i can see
The part of you that's drifting over me
And when i wake you're, you're never there
When i sleep you're, you're everywhere
You're everywhere


Just tell me how i got this far
Just tell me why you're here and who you are
Cuz everytime i look you're never there
And everytime i sleep you're always there

Cuz you're everywhere to me
And when i close my eyes it's you i see
You're everything i know that makes me believe
I'm not alone

I'm not alone

I recognize the way you make me feel
It's hard to think that you might not be real
I sense it now the water's getting deep
I try to wiash the pain away from me (away from me)

Cuz you're everywhere to me
And when i close my eyes it's you i see
You're everything i know that makes me believe
I'm not alone

I'm not alone
I'm not alone

When i touch your hand
It's then i understand
The beauty lies within
It's now that we begin and
You always like my way
There never comes a day
No matter where i go
I always feel you so

Cuz you're everywhere to me
And when i close my eyes it's you i see
You're everything i know that makes me believe
I'm not alone

Cuz you're everywhere to me
And when i catch my breath it's you i breathe
You're everything i know that makes me believe
I'm not alone

You're in everyone i see
So tell me
Do you see me?
