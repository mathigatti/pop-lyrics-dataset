Oh drop your laundry and slam the door
I want your love so give me more
I'm a beggar but I don't want a dime


Oh baby baby it's fuck time
You know I really wanna make you mine
Oh baby baby it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed

Oh Amanda Jones, your holy grace
I wanna choke you 'til you're blue in the face
Got dirty thoughts and a dirty mind

Oh baby baby it's fuck time
You know I really wanna make you mine
Oh baby baby it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say

Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed

Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed
