Don't want to have you hangin,
Around me like a leech.
I think you're just a problem,
So stay the hell away from me because I don't believe in you.
And I wanna sit here all my life alone.
This may sound a little rough,
Don't wanna fall in love.
Don't need security.
I ain't no dog without a bone.
Don't have no time for love.
So stay the fuck away from me because I don't believe in you,
And I wanna sit here all my life alone.
This may sound a little rough.
Don't wanna fall in love.


This may sound a little rough.
Don't wanna fall in love.
This may sound a little rough.
Don't wanna fall in love.
This may sound a little fucked.
Don't wanna fall in love.
