Smell your technicolour in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it ilke it's so enlightening
Staring in the sun that's blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky


Dressed to the nines like a black cats eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
And it goes...

Wearing a psychotic red alert
A bouqet of flowers in the dirt
Radioactive and primal, Nuclear and so delightful
Wearing day-glo where you know it hurts

Dressed to the nines like a black cats eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
And it goes...


Smell your technicolour in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it ilke it's so enlightening
Staring in the sun that's blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky


Dressed to the nines like a black cats eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
And it goes...
