When I was younger
I thought the world circled around me
But in time I realized I was wrong
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
It was a tragic case of my reality
Do you think you're indestructable
And no one can touch you
Well I think you're disposeable
And it's time you knew the truth
Cause it's just one of my lies
It's just one of my lies
I only wanted to get real high
Cause it's just one of my lies


Why does my life have to be so small?
Yet death is forever
And does forever have a life to call its own?
Don't give me an answer cause you only know as much as I know
Unless you're been there once
Well I hardly think so

I used to pray all night
Before I lay myself down
My mother said it was right
Her mother said it too...
Why?
