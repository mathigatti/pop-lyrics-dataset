I got under the grip
Between the modern hell
I got the rejection letter in the mail and
It was already ripped to shreds.
Seasons in a ruin and
This bitter pill is chased with blood
There's fire in my veins
And it's pouring out like a flood


Whoa, Christian's inferno
Whoa, Christian's inferno
Whoa, Christian's inferno
Whoa, Christian's inferno

This diabolic state is gracing my existence
Like a catastrophic baby
Baby, maybe you're the chemical reaction
I am the atom bomb
I am the chosen one
Toxin your reservoir
And then return man to ape

Whoa, Christian's inferno
Whoa, Christian's inferno
Whoa, Christian's inferno
Whoa, Christian's inferno
