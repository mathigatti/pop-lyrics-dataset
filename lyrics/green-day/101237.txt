She's a rebel
She's a saint
She's salt of the earth
And she's dangerous


She's a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction

From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they
Call "Oh, whatsername?!"

She's the symbol
Of resistance
And she's holding on my
Heart like a hand grenade

Is she dreaming
What I'm thinking
Is she the mother of all bombs
Gonna detonate

Is she trouble
Like I'm trouble
Make it a double
Twist of fate
Or a melody that

She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Nothing comes to mind

She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Nothing comes to mind

She's a rebel
She's a saint
She's salt of the earth
And she's dangerous

She's a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction

She's a rebel
She's a saint
She's salt of the earth
And she's dangerous

She's a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction

She's a rebel, she's a rebel, she's a rebel, and she's
Dangerous
She's a rebel, she's a rebel, she's a rebel, and she's
Dangerous
