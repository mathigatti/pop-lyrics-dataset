Wanna be a pretty boy
Wanna go on solid gold
Wanna date a millionaire
Wanna make people stare


I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I want to be on TV
Started out in 64
Gonna be an omnivore
I wanna make the people dance
Gonna take off my pants

On a magazine
Gonna have some free cocaine
Wanna wear my Calvin Kleins
Then the world will be all mine
