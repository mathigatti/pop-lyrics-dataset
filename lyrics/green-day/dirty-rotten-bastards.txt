Yeah

Calling all demons, this is the season
Next stop is therapy
We're the retarded and the broken hearted
The season of misery


Here's to the wasted, I can almost taste it
The rejects, the wastes of times
You'll take it further, get away with murder
And no one is getting out alive

Here's to all god's losers ra da da di
A bottom feeders frenzy
Here's to all bloodsuckers sing along with me
Cause we don't say no scream
One, two, three

Yeah

Hey

We're too old till we misbehave
We sold our souls and somehow shamed ourselves
So we wait for this judgment day
Write me a letter and send it to my graveyard

All fucked beyond intervention
Fuck the world this is my revolution
We're all lost souls and living in cages
"I'm all but better" is one for the ages

I've got the urge
To bitch and surge
The tables turn
To crash and burn

Julianna homicide
Make my demons come to life
Well julianna homicide
I want you to be my blushing bride

I'm drawing a line in my best friends ashes
Dust to dust when the red light flashes
What the fuck does ok stand for
When the afterlife is only worth dieing for

I've got the urge
To bitch and surge
The tables turn
To crash and burn

Julianna homicide
Make my demons come to life
Well julianna homicide
I want you to be my blushing bride
Alright

Well california's burning to the ground
And julianna walks on holy ground
Where there's smoke there's fire burning at the light
Cause california's burning down tonight
Tonight

Calling all demons, this is the season
Next stop is therapy
We're the retarded and the broken hearted
The season of misery

Here's to the wasted, I can almost taste it
The rejects, the wastes of times
Gonna take it further, get away with murder
And no one is getting out alive

Here's to all god's losers ra da da di
The bottom feeders frenzy
Here's to all bloodsuckers sing along with me
Cause we don't say no
Scream one, two, three

We're carried away
Carried away
Carried away
