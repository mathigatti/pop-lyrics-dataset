Well I've got some scattered pictures
Lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we shared
Makes me wish that you were here cause
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
All the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes


Well, open the past and present now and we are there,
story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present, and the future too
It's all I got and I'm giving it to you

Loose ends tied in knots leaving a lump down in my throat
Gagging on a souvenir
Lodged to fill another year
Well, drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds
Leaving myself open wide
Living out a sacrifice

Well, open the past and present now and we are there,
story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present, and the future too
It's all I got and I'm giving it to you

If you got no one
And I've got no place to go
Would it be alright?
Could it be alright?

I've got some scattered pictures
Lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we shared
Makes me wish that you were here cause
Now it seems I've forgotten my
Purpose in this life
All the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes

Well, open the past and present now and we are there,
story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present, and the future too
It's all I got and I'm giving it to you

It's all I got and I'm giving it to you.
