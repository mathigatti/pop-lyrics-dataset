I woke up to a message of love
Choking up on the smoke from above
I'm obsessed with the poison and us
What a mess 'cause there's no one to trust


Huh-uh, come on, honey
Huh-uh, count your money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
There's a riot living inside of us

I got paranoia, baby
And it's so hysterical
Cracking up under the pressure
Looking for a miracle

Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lying in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us

I'm impressed with the presence of none
I'm possessed by the heat of the Sun
Hurry up 'cause I'm making a fuss
Fingers up 'cause there's no one to trust

Huh-uh, come on, honey
Huh-uh, count your money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
There's a riot living inside of us

I got paranoia, baby
And it's so hysterical
Cracking up under the pressure
Looking for a miracle

Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lying in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us

Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lying in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us

Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lying in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us
Uh-huh, yeah
