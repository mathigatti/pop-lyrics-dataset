I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it till my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69


Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far

Oh when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life!

Ain't no use in complaining
When you got a job to do
Spent my evening's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standing on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life!

Back in the summer of '69

Man, we were killing time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no!!

And now the times are changing
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about you wonder what went wrong

Standing on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life!

Back in the summer of '69
It was the summer of '69
