If you're gonna scream, scream with me
Moment's like this never last
When new creatures rape your face
Hybrids open up the door


Ooh baby when you cry
Your face is momentary
You hide your looks behind these scars

In hybrid moments
Give me a moment

Give me a moment
Give me a moment
Ooh baby when you cry
Your face is momentary
You hide your looks behind these scars

In hybrid moments
In hybrid moments

In hybrid moments
In hybrid moments

Give me a moment
Give me a moment
