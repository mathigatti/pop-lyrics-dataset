I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted in a daze


It should seem obvious to you
Your screams and cries are never going to work
And all of your time gets wasted in my daze

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break through these chains
These chains that control
My future's aim

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted in a daze

Maybe I'm just too damn lazy
Or maybe I was just brainwashed to think that way
And all of your time gets wasted in my daze

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break through these chains
These chains that control
My future's aim

I'm looking
Back now at
Where I have
Have gone wrong
And why I
Could not seem
Could not seem
To get along

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break through these chains
These chains that control
My future's aim
