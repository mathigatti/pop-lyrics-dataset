Come with me and let's go for a ride
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout


Cause I know that you're the
Best thing in town -- Best thing around
Best thing in town -- Best thing around

Running wild and always running free
Doing things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds

Now I know that you're the
Best thing in town -- Best thing around
Best thing in town -- Best thing around

I'm seeing faces...
Of mysterys of the Earth
I am not one ...
To the aggressions of my birth
Or go to stance...
Of hallucinations I can't find
A missing peice...
Of a thought that's in my mind

Come with me and let's go for a ride
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout

Cause I know that you're the
Best thing in town -- Best thing around
Best thing in town -- Best thing around

Running wild and always running free
Doing things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds

Now I know that you're the
Best thing in town -- Best thing around
Best thing in town -- Best thing around
