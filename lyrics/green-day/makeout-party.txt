Hey you've got yourself a pretty little mouth
I think I want to rub the wrong way
Do you wanna spin the bottle?
Play a game of chicken?
It's a tongue twister untill your lips are bleeding


Anyhow anywhere
Kiss me there, kiss me there
Scream and shout, truth or dare
Kiss me there, kiss me there

You're so precious
You're a fucking delinquent
I got myself jonesing and I need some fixin'
It's a makeout party on another dimension
And it's gonna get crowded with some bad intentions

Anyhow anywhere
Kiss me there, kiss me there
Scream and shout, truth or dare
Kiss me there, kiss me there

You're so precious
You're a fucking delinquent
I got myself jonesing and I need some fixin'
It's a makeout party on another dimension
And it's gonna get crowded with some bad intentions

Anyhow anywhere
Kiss me there, kiss me there
Scream and shout, truth or dare
Kiss me there, kiss me there
Kiss me there, kiss me there
Kiss me there
