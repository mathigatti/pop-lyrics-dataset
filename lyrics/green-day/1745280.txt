Olivia, Olivia, it's raining outside
The city is drenched, there's a moon out tonight
There's a break in the clouds, just under the stars
We wanna go on and watch from afar


We couldn't care when and stepped in the mud
It makes no sense but you misunderstood
The city is in ruins, but there's a flower in the crack of the streets

Olivia, Olivia, I'll give you my best
Safe in my arms, I'll lay you to rest
You can borrow my coat, you wear the dress
Olivia, Olivia, come follow me home
