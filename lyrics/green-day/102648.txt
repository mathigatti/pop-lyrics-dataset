Sitting in my room last night
Staring at the mirror
I couldn't find a reason why
I couldn't be near her


'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you'd say

Pictures going through my mind
When we're together
All these long and sleepless nights
Will I ever get better

'Cause you are the one that I want (x4)

Now you know how I feel
This love is forever
You make my life seem so unreal
Will I ever get better? ...

'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you'd say

'Cause you are the one that I want (x4)
