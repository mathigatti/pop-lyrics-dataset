I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning


I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
Cause she's 2000 light years away
She holds my malachite so tight so
Never let go

Cause she's 2000 light years away
Years Away!

I sit outside and watch the sunrise
Lookout as far as I can

I can't see her, but in the distance
I hear some laughter,
We laugh together

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
Cause she's 2000 light years away
She holds my malachite so tight so

Never let go
Cause she's 2000 light years away
Years Away!

I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
Cause she's 2000 light years away
She holds my malachite so tight so

Never let go
Cause she's 2000 light years away
