We'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worshiped will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
He decides and the shotgun sings the song


I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a vow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around me
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then i'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again

The change, it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold, that's all
And the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
'cause the banners, they were flown in the last war

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a vow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around me
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then i'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again

No, no

I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
Though i know that the hypnotized never lie

Do ya

Yeah

There's nothing in the streets
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
And the party on the left
Is now the party on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a vow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Get on my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then i'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again

Don't get fooled again, no, no

Yeah

Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss
