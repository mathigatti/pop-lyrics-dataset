Been fighting for so long,
Don't know which way up is
Been stuck and ripped and burnt
Till it feels like nothin'
Our time will come,
And when it's over and it's done,
Those fools are gonna know
That we ain't bluffin'


We're gonna make it
We'll reach the top
We're gonna make it
And then
We're never gonna stop

The power of the people
Ain't been showin'
It's never what you know
Its who you're knowin'
Sure it ain't right,
But as the saying goes its might
That decides who stays behind
And who'll be goin'

We're gonna make it
We'll reach the top
We're gonna make it
And then
We're never gonna stop

We're gonna make it
We'll reach the top
We're gonna make it
And then
We're never gonna stop
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, were gonna make it
Gonna make it to the top
Ain't gonna stop until we drop
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Drive hard boys
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
