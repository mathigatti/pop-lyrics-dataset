And nobody cares
And nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
And nobody cares
And nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?


Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on east 12th st.
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
like cigarettes and coffe whit the underbelly
His life is on the line with anxiety now
And she had enough
And he's had plenty
Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here
So far away
I don't want to stay
Get me out of here right now
I just wanna be free
Is there a ponssibility?
Get me out of here right now
This life like aint for me
