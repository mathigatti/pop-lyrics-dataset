Another one down at the mining town
Breaking it down for the lame wager
Calling the shots from the capital
All that we got was the banks of hope


Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?

This city isn't big enough for dreamers
We were all believers
It's the perfect crime
(Only the lonely and wasted)

Another black kid was shot in town
A man with the badge and a daytime show
Darkness falls on Graffitia
Death of a town in the afterglow

Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?

All souls go to heaven in Graffitia
Singing Hallelujah
It's the perfect crime
(Only the lonely and wasted)
If we're goin' down for a good time
Life during war time
It's the perfect crime
(Only the lonely and wasted)

Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?

Are we the last forgotten? (Another one down at the mining town)
Are we the long lost love? (Breaking it down for the lame wager)
Are we the last forgotten? (Calling the shots from the capital)
Are we the last forgotten? (All that we got was the banks of hope)

Another one down at the mining town
(Are we the last forgotten?)
Callin' the shots from the capital
(Are we the last forgotten?)
Another one down at the mining town
(Are we the last forgotten?)
