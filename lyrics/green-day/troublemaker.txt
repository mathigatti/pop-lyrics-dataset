Hey! You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest when I'm standing at the traffic light
Hey! I wanna get inside of you
I wanna crack your cranium, delirium on the lower east side of your mind


Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker

Hey! I like your BMW
I like your BM-excellent tits with a tattoo of a pig sniffing glue
Hey! You're living at the W
You're looking like a Jezebel, hot as hell, sun burn in a pink bathing suit

Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker

Easy come and go, gonna go it alone
Knock yourself out with a shot of Patron
I wouldn't say I'm straight 'cause I'm bent out of shape
From now till death do we party just before it's too late

Hey! You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest when I'm standing at the traffic light

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
