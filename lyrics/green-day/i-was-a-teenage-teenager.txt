I don't want to freak you out, but I cannot lie
I don't want to freak you out, but I cannot lie
So who's holding the drugs? Who's holding the drugs?
I don't want to freak you out, but I cannot lie


I was a teenage teenager full of piss and vinegar
Living like a prisoner for haters
I was a teenage teenager, I'm an alien visitor
My life's a mess and school is just for suckers

I don't want to freak you out, but I cannot lie
I don't want to freak you out, but I cannot lie
So who's holding the drugs? Who's holding the drugs?
I don't want to freak you out, but I cannot lie

I was a teenage teenager full of piss and vinegar
Living like a prisoner for haters
I was a teenage teenager, I'm an alien visitor
My life's a mess and school is just for suckers

I was a teenage teenager full of piss and vinegar
Living like a prisoner for haters
I was a teenage teenager, I'm an alien visitor
My life's a mess and school is just for suckers
