[I. Her Man's Been Gone]

Her man's been gone
For nearly a year
He was due home yesterday
But he ain't here


Her man's been gone
For nigh on a year
He was due home yesterday
But he ain't here

[II. Crying Town]

Down your street your crying is a well-known sound
Your street is very well known, right here in town
Your town is very famous for the little girl
Whose cries can be heard all around the world

No need to be so sad

We'll bring you flowers and things
Help pass your time
We'll give him eagle's wings
Then he can fly to you

Little girl, why don't you stop your crying?
I'm gonna make you feel all right

[IV. Ivor The Engine Driver]

My name is Ivor
I'm an engine driver

I know him well
I know why you feel blue
Just 'cause he's late
Don't mean he'll never get through

He told me he loves you
He ain't no liar, I ain't either
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver

Please take a sweet
Come take a walk with me
We'll sort it out
Back at my place, maybe

It'll come right
You ain't no fool, I ain't either
So why not be nice to an old engine driver?
Better be nice to an old engine driver
Better be nice to an old engine driver

[V. Soon Be Home]

We'll soon be home
We'll soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

We'll soon be home
We'll soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

Come on, old horse

Soon be home
Soon be home
Soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

We'll soon be home
Soon be home ...

[VI. You Are Forgiven]

Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang

Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello

I can't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me?
Am I back in your arms?
Away from all harm?

It's like a dream to be with you again
Can't believe that I'm with you again

I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him, had a nap

You are forgiven, you are forgiven, you are forgiven ... [ad lib]

You are forgiven
