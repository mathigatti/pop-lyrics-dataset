To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe


And i leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist

So i run
I run away
The light of masochist

And i leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And i walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time

I don't feel any shame
I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go

Running away from pain
When you've been victimized
Tales from another broken home

You're leaving
You're leaving
You're leaving
Ah you're leaving home
