Here we go again, infatuation
Touches me just when I
Thought that it would end
Oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but
I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking


Well, I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that it's not different at all
Well, I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
That's when I say
What the hey?

Would it last forever?
You and I together, hand and hand
We run away (far away)
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can
Give that comes my way, yeah (far away)
