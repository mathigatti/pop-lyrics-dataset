Manic depression how I wish I had a gun 
Monday Tuesday yesterday
I don't know what card to play Lori 1 Lori 2
 I don't the hell to do
 is here is she there
 she's bouncing around everywhere
 is she high is she plain
 all I know is that girl is insane
 
up down all around 
 up down all around
 up down all around
 up down all around
 she's a psycho girl


 social work isn't a major
 how much your act wager
 crazy is a disease leave me alone
 would please kill me
 won't you see put me out of my misery
 prank call nasty letter I've got something even better
 loser she's so mean padded room for my queen
 
up down all around
 up down all around
 up down all around 
up down all around
 she's a psycho girl

 twisted and crazy her mind is lazy 
stupid she's so dumb I can't have any fun 
she doesn't know what to do that why every one hates you 
spoiled spazed out sit back begin to pout
 cause I don't care anymore cause you're a stupid whore
 
up down all around 
up down all around 
up down all around 
up down all around 
she's a psycho girl
 
four ways to end it how it¯ so splendid
 sleeping pills before bed that one way to end up dead
 why no try this instead shoot yourself in the head
 slit your wrists make it good
 how I hope, I hope you would step out in front of a bus
 why do you just save us

 up down all around
 up down all around
 up down all around 
up down all around
 she's¯ a psycho girl.
