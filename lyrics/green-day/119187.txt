Let's get drunk and go out driving
Let's see just how quickly we can go
Let's get ploughed and plough down some old lady
Let's just drink and bump the stereo
Let's go down and vomit out of the window
Let's keep score of how many we kill
Two tequila slammers on the dashboard
There's an alcoholic at the wheel
Careful when I'm taking this next corner
Don't want anybody wasting beer
Pass another lime and Corona
Too drunk to use my clutch when shifting gear
Let's get drunk and go out driving
Let's do prodies in the cul de sac
Let's get drunk and go out driving
We're going and we're never coming back
