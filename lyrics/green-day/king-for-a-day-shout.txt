"King for a day"

Started at the age of 4
My mother went to the grocery store
Went sneaking through her bedroom door
To find something in a size 4


Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose
Is making room for the one and only

King for a day, Princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, Princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

My daddy threw me in therapy
He thinks I'm not a real man
Who put the drag in the drag queen
Don't knock it until you tried it

===============================

"Shout"

Well, you know you make me wanna
(Shout) Throw my hand up
(Shout) Kick my heels back
(Shout) Throw my head back

You're old enough to know
An' you wanna leave me
You wanna let me go
