Standing on the corner of Stuart and the Avenue
Ripping up my transfer and a photograph of you
You're a blur of my dead past and rotting existence
As I stand laughing on the corner of insignificance


Well, destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it's all fucked up

Seasons change as well as minds and I'm a two-faced clown
You're mommy's little nightmare driving daddy's car around
I'm beat down and half brain dead the long lost king of fools
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid enough to stay with you

Well, destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it's all fucked up

Well, destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it's all fucked up
We're all fucked up
You're all fucked up
