I'm on a mission I made my decision
To lead a path of self-destruction
A slow progression killing my complexion
And it's rotting out my teeth


I'm on a roll no self control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want, that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face

Every hour my blood is turning sour
And my pulse is beating out of time
I found a treasure filled with sick pleasure
And it sits on a thick white line

I'm on a roll no self control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want, that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face. Uh

I'm on a mission I got no decision
Like a cripple running the rat race
Wish in one hand and shit in the other
And see which one gets filled first

I'm on a roll no self control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want
That's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face
