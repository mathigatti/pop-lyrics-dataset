Concrete dream (hey)
I'm gonna make a scene
Radio
Covered in gasoline
Sleeping in reverse and everybody's bouncing off the walls


Bombs away (hey)
It's just another day
Of idle threats
The secret alphabet
And I wouldn't sweat it and everybody's bouncing off the walls
(I'm bouncing off the walls!)

Alright

Concrete kiss (hey)
Come on and do the twist
The Radio
My little exorcist
We're all getting pissed and everybody's bouncing off the walls
(I'm bouncing off the walls!)

'Cause it's all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks
And we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes

Hey!
Hey!

'Cause it's all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks
And we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes

Hey!
Hey!
