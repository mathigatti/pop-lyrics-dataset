St. Jimmy's coming down across the alley way
Upon the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a silhouette
He's insubordinate
Coming at you on the count of 1, 2, 3, 4


My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your momma talked about
King of the forty thieves
And I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment

I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Cigaretes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city under a halo of lights
The product of war and fear that we've been victimized

I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Are you talking to me?
I'll give you something to cry about

St. Jimmy!

My name is St. Jimmy I'm a son of a gun
I'm the one that's from the way outside
I'm a teenage assassin executing some fun
In the cult of the life of crime
I'd really hate to say it but I told you so
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down ol' boy
Welcome to the club and give me some blood
I'm the resident leader of the lost and found

It's comedy and tragedy
It's St. Jimmy
And that's my name
And don't wear it out!
