He's a victim of his own time
in his "vintage suit" and tie
he's a casualty dressed to the teeth
in the latest genocide

cloaked with style
for pedophiles as the credit card explodes

you auctioned off your life
for the "most" expensive price
going once...
going twice...
now it's gone

you auctioned off your life

what's in a name, hey?
what's in a name, hey?
what's in a name?
