Is your heart singing out of tune
Are your eyes just singing the blues
Dirty records from another time
Some bloodstains on your shoes


No one really knows about your soul
And I barely really know your name
Burning rhythms and posting lies
And a bunch of fools drown in shame

Amy don't you go
I want you around
Singin' 'woah', please, don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?

Did you tattoo a lucky charm
To keep you out of harms way?
Warding off all evil signs
But never really kept you safe

Now you're too young for the golden age
Cause the record bins been replaced
27 gone without a trace
And you walked away from your drink

Amy, don't you go
I want you around
Singin' woah please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of...
Amy, please, don't go
Amy, please, don't go

Is your heart singing out of tune
Are you eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes

May I have this last dance
By chance if we should meet?
Can you write me a lullaby?
So we can sing you to sleep

Amy, don't you go
I want you around
Singin' 'woah', please, don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
