Oh love, oh love
Won't you rain on me tonight?
Oh life, oh life
Please don't pass me by


Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop when the red lights flash
Oh ride, free ride
Won't you take me close to you?

Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart's on the loose

Oh lights and action
I just can't be satisfied
Oh losers and choosers
Won't you please hold on my life

Oh hours and hours
Like the dog years of the day
Old story, same old story
Won't you see the light of day

Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart's on the loose

Talk myself out of feeling
Talk my way out of control
Talk myself out of falling in love
Falling in love with you

Oh love, oh love
Won't you rain on me tonight?
Oh ride, free ride
Won't you take me close to you?

Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart's on the loose

Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away, far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart's on the loose

Tonight my heart's on the loose
Tonight my heart's on the loose
