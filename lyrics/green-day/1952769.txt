I lost my way, oh, baby
This stray heart
Went to another
Can you recover, baby?
Oh, you're the only one that I'm dreaming of
Your precious heart
Was torn apart by me and


You, you're not alone
Oh, and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want
I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need
I need from you
But I just can't have you

I said a thousand times
And now a thousand one
We'll never part
I'll never stray again from you

This dog is destined for a home
To your heart
We'll never part
I'll never stray again from you

You, you're not alone
Oh, and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want
I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need
I need from you
But I just can't have you

You're not alone
Oh, and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want
I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need
I need from you
But I just can't have you

Everything that I want
I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need
I need from you
But I just can't have you
