I'm too tired to be bored
I'm too bored to be tired
And the silence is so deafening
It's like picking at a sore
I'm too mental to go crazy
I'm too drunk to be pure
And my mind is playing tricks on me
And I can't sleep tonight 'cause I'm so tired


I can't take it anymore
What with all the liars
Like a prisoner of war
I don't want your sympathy
I don't want your honesty
I just want to get some peace of mind
It's only in my head
As I roll over and play dead
I don't want to hear it anymore

It's good to see you
But I really must admit
There's an odor in the air
And I think you look like shit
I can't stand from falling down
I'm too sick to throw up
Everyone keeps talking
And they can't shut the fuck up 'cause I'm so tired

I can't take it anymore
What with all the liars
Like a prisoner of war
I don't want your sympathy
I don't want your honesty
I just want to get some peace of mind
It's only in my head
As I roll over and play dead
I don't want to hear it anymore

I don't want your sympathy
I don't want your honesty
I just want to get some peace of mind
It's only in my head
As I roll over and play dead
I don't want to hear about it
I don't want to scream about it
I don't want to hear it anymore
