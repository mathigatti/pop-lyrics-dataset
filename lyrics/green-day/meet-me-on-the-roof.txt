I'm crawling on the dance floor (dance floor)
I think I lost my phone
Feeling like a toothache (toothache)
My face is going numb
I beg a thousand pardons
All my friends are crazy
Hanging from a window (window)
And all you gotta do is jump


Come meet me on the roof tonight, girl, oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl? Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight, oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl?

I'm hanging with the cholos (cholo)
Cruising down the strip
Sleeping with a pillow (don't wake me up, don't wake me up)
Waking up in spit
I'm taking drowning lessons
Secret words and true confessionals (confessional)
Now, the worst is yet to come

Come meet me on the roof tonight, girl, oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl? Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight, oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl?

So meet me where the good times go, ooh
How high is your low? As far as I can go

Come meet me on the roof tonight, girl, oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl? Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight, oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl?
