I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me anda I walk alone
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you


I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone
Every day I wake up and it's sunday
Whatever's in my head won't go away
The radio is playing all the usual
And what's a wonderwall anyway

Back beat, the word is on the street that
The fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
(Maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me)
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
(Maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me)
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
(Maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me saves me)
'Til then I walk alone
Sing with me; sing for the year (sing it!)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away...
