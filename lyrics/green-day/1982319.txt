Breaking in a sweat, like a bomb threat
Is your silhouette fading out
Nothing left to lose, detonate the fuse
Another breaking news blowout


Ain't it beautiful, so unusual
Life's a gas and it's running out
Living a cliche, gonna seize the day
Bottle rockets and celebrate

Carpe diem, a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?

Making a living, making a killing
What's worth forgiving, allright

A blink of an eye, barely scraping by
Dominated by passersby
Feeling out of luck, when the traffic's stuck
And you're feeling so left behind

Getting off a binge, get a second wind
Another promise, to make a change
Got a broken wing, hear the angels sing
With a signal is out of range
Ain't it strange

Carpe diem, a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?

Making a living, making a killing
What's worth forgiving, allright

Making a living, making a killing
What's worth forgiving, allright

Carpe diem, a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?

Carpe diem, a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?
