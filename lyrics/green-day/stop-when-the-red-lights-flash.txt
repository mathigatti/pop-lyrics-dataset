Uncomfortable silence
I’ll kill it if you want me to
I’m like ultra-violence
I’ll kill it if you want me to


Out of sight, out of mind
I’m not the hurting kind

I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender

Stop when the red lights flash
I’ll trade you blood for dirty cash
Life in the catacombs
You make me feel like I’m at home

Out of sight, out of mind
I’m not the hurting kind

I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender

Out of sight, out of mind
Just give me one more time

I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender

I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender
I’ll make you surrender
