Starry nights, city lights
Coming down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers
In my head
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
Lost and found city bound in my dreams


And screaming
Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting...
And screaming
Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting...

Forget me nots, second thoughts
Live in isolation
Heads or tails and fairytales in my mind
Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting unknown
The rage and love, the story of my life
The Jesus of suburbia is a lie

And screaming
Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting...
And screaming
Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting...unknown
Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting...
And screaming
Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting...unknown
Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting...unknown
