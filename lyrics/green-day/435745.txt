Baby's back, all dressed in black,
Silver buttons all down her back.
High-ho your tipsy toe,
She broke a needle and she can't sew.
Walkin' the dog,
Just a-walkin' the dog.
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how the walk the dog.


Asked your mother for fifteen cents,
See the fellow he jumped the fence.
Jumped so high he touched the sky,
Don't get back till the fourth of july.
Walkin' the dog,
Just a-walkin' the dog.
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how the walk the dog.

Baby's back, all dressed in black,
Silver buttons all down her back.
High-ho your tipsy toe,
She broke a needle and she can't sew.
Walkin' the dog,
Just a-walkin' the dog.
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how the walk the dog.

If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how the walk the dog. x3
