Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color is candy apple girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife


What's that I hear?
You wanna go for a ride?
Don't be afraid boy to come inside
I got that thing that you want, the fix that you need
Chase this with a little lust and greed
I'll be the devil on your shoulder
Saying "Hey boy come over"
My black heart beats crimson and clover
So operator, operator patch my boy in
This is nightlife, I'll get under your skin

Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color is candy apple girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife

Short of breath heart beats fast
Sounds like love but you know it won't last
Cheap champagne stain on a even cheaper suit
Hope there's more in your pants than a bus route
Red velvet Halls line these sugar-coated walls
Girls hang on bar stools for late last calls
This town is full of snakes, mistakes, and whiskey shakes
It's too late I already cut the brakes

Well I am rolling, strolling into town
Is it me or am I going crazy? (It's just you)
This dirty city is my sugar town (Sugar town)
My little angel of death is my nightlife

Gonna make a move before I get bored
If you wanna explore my vocal chord
Baby girl coco dancing the cooch
One hand on my knee one hand on the hooch
Why don't you stick around for one more round
This place is a circus and I know you'll be my clown
Cause I'm the ringleader, I run the show
And only when I tell ya will it be time to go

Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color is candy apple girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife

Hey boy
She is my nightlife
See you later
