How do you get your sleep at night
How did you get your noose so tight
Like chewing on tinfoil, it's so much fun
Gonna be dead before your gone


'Cause look how things have gotten
And I'll be happy so I won't pretend
And I'll be cheering that you're going down
And I'll be laughing, I'll be laughing

How many feelings can you steal
Gotta be part of your appeal
I can see through you 'cause your wearing thin
Like chewing on tinfoil once again

'Cause look how things have gotten
And I'll be happy so I won't pretend
And I'll be cheering that you're going down
And I'll be laughing

Ha ha you're dead
And I'm so happy
In loving memory of your demise
When your ship is going down
I'll go out and paint the town
Ha ha you're dead
Ha ha you're dead
Ha ha you're dead

Ha ha ha

Ha ha you're dead
And I'm so happy.
In loving memory of your demise
When your ship is going down
I'll go out and paint the town
Ha ha you're dead
Ha ha you're dead
Ha ha you're dead

Ha ha you're dead
The joke is over
You were an asshole and now you're gone
As your ship is going down
I'll stand by and watch you drown.
Ha ha you're dead
Ha ha you're dead
Ha ha you're dead

Ha ha you're dead
You're gonna be dead
Just remember what I said
Ha ha you're dead
Ha ha you're dead
Ha ha you're dead
