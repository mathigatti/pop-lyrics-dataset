Here they come marching pown the street
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat
Coming back from the egde of town
Underneath their feet
the time has come and it's going nowhere


Nobody eversaid that life was fair now
Go-carts and guna are treasures they willbear
In the summer heat
the world is spinning around and around out of control again
From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb
and visit me in hell
we're the ones going home

We're coming home again
I started fuckin' running
just as soon as my feet touch ground
we're back in the barrio
but to you and me, that's jingletown
home
We're coming home again

Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They're all out without you
havin' fun!
