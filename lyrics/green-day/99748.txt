I wish I could tell you
But the words would come out wrong
Oh if you only knew
The way I've felt for so long
I know that we're worlds apart
But I just don't seem to care
These feelings in my heart
Only with you I want to share


The first time I caught a glimpse of you
Then all my thoughts were only of you

I hope that when time goes by
You will think the same about me
Many nights awake I lie
I only wish that you could see
I know that we're only friends
I hope this feeling never ends
If I could only hold you
It's the only thing I want to do

The first time I caught a glimpse of you
Then all my thoughts were only of you
