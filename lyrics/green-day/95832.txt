(Say, hey!)

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name


Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called Faith and Misery (hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protestor has crossed the line (hey!)
To find the money's on the other side

Can I get another amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

(Hey!)

(The representative from California has the floor)

Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang, goes the broken glass and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me

Just 'cause (hey, hey)
Just cause, because we're outlaws, yeah!

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

This is our lives on holiday
