You gotta problem you just can't hide
Compulsive habits that never seem to die
Your breath is taking up all the air
Your teeth are rotting to black holes in your head


Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story's stretched
And so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse
You lied

Your mother allowed you just one white lie
But now she's dead and she left you with a problem
Pinnochio has pierced your tongue
Your nose is growing into the third dimension

Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story's stretched 
And so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse
You lied

Oh, you lied

Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story's stretched
And so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse
You lied
