At the center of the earth
In the parking lot of the 7-11 where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says "home is where your heart is"
But what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time


City of the dead
At the end od another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned
Lost children with with dirty faces today
No one really seems to care

I read the grafitti in the bathroom stail
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
And so it semmed to confess
It didn't say much
But it only confirmed that
The center of the earth is the end of the world
And I could really careless

City of the dead
At the end od another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned
Lost children with with dirty faces today
No one really seems to care
