Walking down the street, and i find it i out if i should leave
(cause i've been feeling pretty worthless latley)
Now i think we should find a place down town
A place that i used to hang around
(and get us something, a capucino maybe)
I'm so let down,
I'm so good now
Now i feel just like superman,going everywhere i can
I feel just like superman
And i feel just like romeo, if you want a golden rose
I feel just like romeo, yeah
Now i'll have cab or bus and we're
(driving down mile 69, here ona bus)
And i'm finding my way back home
Because i'm taking back control of my life
I'm not afraid cause it feels so right
(and i feel so much better for this)
Im so let down,
Im so good now
Now i feel just like superman,going everywhere i can
I feel just like superman
And i feel just like romeo, if you want a golden rose
I feel just like romeo
Im so let down,
Im so good now
(yeah i felt so pushed aroun man)
Now i feel just like superman,going everywhere i can
I feel just like superman
And i feel just like romeo, if you want a golden rose
I feel just like romeo
And i feel just like super man..... (fades away)
