What good is love and peace on earth
When it's exclusive?
Where's the truth in the written word
If no one reads it?


A new day dawning
Comes without warning
So don't think twice

We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times

What part of history we learned
When it's repeated?
Some things will never overcome
If we don't seek it

The world stops turning
Paradise burning
So don't think twice

We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times

We run for cover
Like a skyscraper's falling down
Then I wander like a troubled mind

What good is love and peace on earth
When it's exclusive?
Where's the truth in the written word
If no one reads it?

A new day dawning
Comes without warning
So don't look twice

We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times

We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
