Violence is an energy
Against the enemy
Well, violence is an energy (Right?)

Bringing on the fury
The choir infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey

Overthrow the effigy
The vast majority
Well, burning down the foreman of control

Silence is the enemy
Against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul

Do you know the enemy?

Well, gotta know the enemy (Right?)

Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Right?)

The insurgency will rise
When the bloods been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies
In your eyes

Well, violence is an energy
Well, from here to eternity
Well, violence is an energy
Well, silence is the enemy
So gimme, gimme revolution!

Do you know the enemy?

The vast majority
Well, burning down the foreman of control

Silence is the enemy
Against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul
