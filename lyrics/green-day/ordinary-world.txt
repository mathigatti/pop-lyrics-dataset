Where can I find the city of shining light
In an ordinary world?
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world?


The days into years roll by
It's where that I live until I die
Ordinary world

What would you wish if you saw a shooting star
In an ordinary world?
I've walked to the end of the earth and afar
In an ordinary world

Baby, I don't have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world

Where can I find the city of shining lights
In an ordinary world?
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world?

Baby, I don't have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world
