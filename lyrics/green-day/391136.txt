1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Look for Love (x6)
When everything seems to go wrong
And you need somebody strong
With a smile and a song
Love for Love


And when you're not having much fun
And the day is never done
Until you do find someone

Look for Love (x2)

And when you find love
And keep all your love
Success and happiness too
Will be for you 

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

And now you really know
That wherever you go
The story is so

Look for Love (x2)

And when you find love
And keep all your love
Success and happiness too
Will be for you 

The story is so

Look for love (till end)
