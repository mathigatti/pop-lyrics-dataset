Words get trapped in my mind,
Sorry I don't take the time to feel the way I do.
'Cause from the first day you came into my life,
My time ticks around you


But then I need your voice
And the key to unlock all the love trapped in me
So tell me when it's time to say I love you.

All I want is you to understand,
That when I take your hand,
It's 'cause I want to.
We are all born in a world of doubt
But there's no doubt,
I figured out...
I love you.

I feel lonely for
All the losers that were meant to take the time to say,
What was really on their mind, instead
They just hide away

Yet they'll never have
Someone like you to back them
And help them on the way
Or tell them when it's time to say I love you.
So tell me when it's time to say I love you.
