I don't wanna go back home
I don't wanna kiss goodnight
Let us paralyze this moment 'til it dies
To the end of the earth
Under the Valley of the Stars
There's a car crashing deep inside my heart


Take a ride through the avenues
Across the Great Divide
There's a siren screaming "I'm alive"
It cries
Red alert is the color
Of your paper valentines
Intertwined on this moment passing by

Take a ride through the avenues
Across the Great Divide
There's a siren screaming "I'm alive"
It cries
Red alert is the color
Of your paper valentines
Intertwined on this moment passing by


Oh, come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines

Cigarettes and valentines!

So, come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines
Oh, come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines

Cigarettes and valentines!
