All the time
Evertime I need it
What's the time?
I'd say the time is right
Here's to me
Let's find another reason
Down the hatch
And a bad attitude salud


Wasting time, wasting time down a bum fuck road
And I don't know where the hell it'll go
Heirlooms and huffing fumes I'm picking up the pace
And I'm gonna smash it straight into a wall

All the time
A New Year's Resolution
How soon that we forget loving every minute
Live it up on another let down salud

Promises, promises, it was all set in stone
Cross my heart and hope to die
Sugar fix, dirty tricks and a trick question
Guess I should have read between the lines

Having the time of my life
Watching the clock tick
Having the time of my life
Watching the clock tick
All the time
Where did all the time go?
It's too late to say goodnight
Time flies when you're having fun
Times up when you work like a dog salud
