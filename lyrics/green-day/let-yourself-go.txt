Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much
And I don’t give a damn anyway
You always seem to be stepping in shit
And all you really do is complain


It’s your life, tell it all you like
Small minds tend to think alike
Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much
And I don't give a fuck anyway

Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

Gotta let me go, gotta let it go
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go

Cut the crap 'cause you're screaming in my ear
And you're talking up all of my space
You're really testing my patience again
And I'd rather get punched in the face

You're getting on my every last nerve
Everything you've said I've already heard
I'm sick to death of your every last breath
And I don't give a fuck anyway

Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

Gotta let me go, gotta let it go
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go

Everyone is fucking with my head now
Don't stop fucking with my head now
You're fucking with my fucking head now

Always fuckin with my head and I gotta let it go

Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
