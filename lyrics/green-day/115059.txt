She's always living like she's running out of time
Too much just ain't enough to keep her satisfied
Her plastic card is filled with nothing comes to mind
It's now her occupation that she's overqualified


The looks are always so deceiving
The truth is always misconstrued

To you...
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too

He's talking shit about how it's better way back when
He lives every waking moment as means to an end
We are we are but I'm not
I never used to be
So god bless your fucking past and to hell with your glory

The looks are always so deceiving
The truth is always misconstrued

Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too

She packs her bags and says goodbye and bon voyage
Hell we'll see you in hell I hope you rest in pieces
Fuck you
Oh..oh oh oh oh...
Oh..oh oh oh oh...

Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you too

Woah...oh oh oh oh..
