I fucked up again it's all my fault
So turn me around and face the wall
Read me my rights and tell me I'm wrong
Until it gets into my thick skull


A slap on the wrist
A stab in the back
Torture me, I've been a bad boy
Nail me to the cross until you have won
I lost before I did any wrong

I'm hexed with regrets and bad luck
Keep you distance 'cause it's rubbing off
Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell
Or earth with me tangled at your feet
You finally met you nemesis disguised as your fatal long lostlove
So kiss it good bye
Until death do we part
You fell for a jinx for crying out loud

I'm a curse hanging around you
I'm a curse hanging around you
I'm a curse hanging around you
I'm a curse hanging around you
