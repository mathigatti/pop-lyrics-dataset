"to know you is to hate you
So loving you must be like suicide
Well, i don't mind
If you don't mind
And i'm not the one that's going to die
I guess i just can't listen
To this one sided conversation again
'cause i don't care
If i don't care
No one ever said that life is fair


Everybody loves a joke
But noone likes a fool
And your always cracking the same old lines again
You're well rehearsed on every verse
And that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity

The center of attention
Got an honorable mention once again
Congratualtions and salutations
You're a figment of your own imagination

Everybody loves a joke
But noone likes a fool
And your always cracking the same old lines again
You're well rehearsed on every verse
And that was stated clear
But noone understands your verity

To know you is to bait you
And you fell victim to your own denial
Well, i dont mind
If you don't mind
You're wasting all your time
