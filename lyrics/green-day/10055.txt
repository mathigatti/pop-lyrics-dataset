I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority


I pledge allegiance to the underworld
One nation under dog there of which I stand alone
A face in the crowd unsung against them all
Without a doubt
Singled out
The only way I know

'Cause I wanna be the minority
I dont need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority

Stepped out of the line
Like a sheep runs from the herd
Marching out of time
To my own beat now
The only way I know

One light, one mind
Flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
For crying out loud she screams unto me
A free for all
Fuck'em all
You are your own sight

'Cause I wanna be the minority
I dont need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority

One light, one mind
Flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
For crying out loud she screams unto me
A free for all
Fuck'em all
You are your own sight

'Cause I wanna be the minority
I dont need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority

I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
