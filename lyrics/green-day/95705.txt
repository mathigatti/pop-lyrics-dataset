Roaming 'round your house wasting your time
No obligation, just wasting your time
So why are you alone wasting your time
When you could be with me wasting your time?


Well, I'm a waste like you
With nothing else to do
May I waste your time too?

Wording off regrets, wasting your time
Smoking cigarrettes, wasting your time
I'm just a parasite wasting your time
Applying myself to wasting your time

Well, I'm a waste like you
With nothing else to do
May I waste your time too?

So why are you alone wasting your time
When you could be with me wasting your time?

Well, I'm a waste like you
With nothing else to do
May I waste your time too?

May I waste your time too?
May I waste your time too?
May I waste your time too?
