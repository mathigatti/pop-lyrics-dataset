See a young girl so soft and blonde
Doesn't attack me but she did once
Intoxications in her veins
Sweet young boy plays with her brain


Lydia'll bring to life
What are your chance not to oblige
Putting his hand on her thigh
Ability has now been ripped
Take it away, I'd rather sit

Sweet children, sweet children, sweet children Remember when?

Johnny's playing fun and games,
or else he's in the storage shed
Running from the light of day,
or maybe lie and celebrate
The funny circus from his head
Follow me if you understand
I'll trick her so she'll do it
Then I'll sing and now we run

Sweet children, sweet children, sweet children Remember when?
Sweet children, sweet children, sweet children Remember when?
