[Part 1 - I'm Freaking Out]

(My name is Billie and I'm freaking out)
I thought, therefore I was
Well, I can't really figure it out
I sit alone with my thoughts and prayers
Scream out my memories
As if I was never there


Standing at the edge of the world
Is giving me the chills
Looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tangle, it's freaking me out
Burning lights and blackouts

From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

(I'm like a punk rocker on Labor Day)
How the hell did I work so hard
To be born this way?
I never learned to read or write so well
(Freaking out)
But I can play the guitar until it hurts like hell

Standing at the edge of the world
Is giving me the chills
Looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tango, it's freaking me out
Burning lights and blackouts

From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

[Part 2 - A Better Way to Die]

If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die
If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die

Oh, I
Don't want to think about tomorrow
Don't want to think about it, oh woah ooh
It doesn't matter anyway
Oh, I
I wanna start a revolution
I want to hear it on my radio
I'll put it off another day

I want a new conspiracy
And the silence of a thousand cries
So hurry up
I want a better way to die

[Part 3 - Somewhere (Reprise)]

I'm running late to somewhere now
That I don't want to be
Where the future and promises ain't what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side ever get so full?

Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now

Oh, I
Don't want to think about tomorrow
Don't want to think about it, oh woah ooh
It doesn't matter anyway
Oh, I
I wanna start a revolution
I want to hear it on my radio
I'll put it off another day

Oh, I (I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
Don't want to think about tomorrow (I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
Don't want to think about it, oh woah ooh (I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
It doesn't matter anyway (I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
Oh, I (I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
I wanna start a revolution (I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
I want to hear it on my radio (I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
I'll put it off another day (I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
