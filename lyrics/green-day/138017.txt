My friend drove off the other day
And now he's gone and all they say
Is you gotta live 'cause life goes on


But now I see I'm mortal too
I can't live my life like you
Gotta live it up while life goes on

And I think it's alright
That I do what I like
'cause that's the way I wanna live
It's how I give, and I'm still giving

And now I wonder about my friend
If he gave all he could give
'Cause he lived his life like I live mine

If you could see inside my head
Then you'd start to understand
The things I value in my heart

And I think it's alright
That I do what I like
'cause that's the way I wanna live
It's how I give, and I'm still giving

You know that
I know that
You're watching me

And I think it's alright
That I do what I like
'cause that's the way I wanna live
It's how I give, and I'm still giving

Gotta make a plan
Gotta do what's right
Can't run around in circles
If you wanna build a life
But I don't wanna make a plan
For a day far away
While I'm young and while I'm able
All I wanna do is
