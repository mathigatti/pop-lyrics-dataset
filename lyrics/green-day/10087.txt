Hey mister, where you headed?
Are you in a hurry?
I need a lift to happy hour
Say oh no


Do you brake for distilled spirits?
I need a break as well
The well that inebriates the guilt
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4

Cold turkey's getting stale
Tonight I'm eating crow
Fermented salmonella poison oak no

There's a drought at the fountain of youth
And now I'm dehydrating
My tongue is swelling up
As say 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4

Troubled times
You know I can not lie
I'm off the wagon
And I'm hitchin' a ride

There's a drought at the fountain of youth
And now I'm dehydrating
My tongue is swelling up
I say
Shit!

Troubled times
You know I can not lie
I'm off the wagon
And I'm hitchin' a ride

(Don't know where I'm goin')
Hitchin' a ride

(Don't know where I'm goin')
Hitchin' a ride

(Don't know where I'm goin')
Hitchin' a ride

(Don't know where I'm goin')
Hitchin' a ride

(Don't know where I'm goin')
Hitchin' a ride

(Don't know where I'm goin')
Hitchin' a ride

(Don't know where I'm goin')
Hitchin' a ride

(Don't know where I'm goin')
Hitchin' a ride
