I woke up to a bitter storm (bitter year)
And Noah's Ark came washed up on the shore
The riot gear has lined the dawn (bitter year)
Like dogs that shit on your neighbor's lawn


Let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade
Let them eat poison and it tastes like lemonade

Back in the USA
For a small town serenade
With fireworks on display
Tonight, it's a hero's welcome home
And there's no place else to go
And I'm takin' it to the grave
Back in the USA

The saddest story ever told (bitter year)
Is feeling safe in our suburban homes
Like soldiers of an endless war (bitter year)
And every church can have a liquor store

Let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade
Let them eat poison and it tastes like lemonade

Back in the USA
For a small town serenade
With fireworks on display
Tonight, it's a hero's welcome home
And there's no place else to go
And I'm takin' it to the grave
Back in the USA
