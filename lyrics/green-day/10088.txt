Nice guys finish last
You're running out of gas
Your sympathy will get you left behind


Sometimes you're at your best
When you feel the worst
Do you feel washed up
Like piss going down the drain

Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have it's truth and now the joke's on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy

Oh nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine

Living on command
You're shaking lots of hands
You're kissing up and bleeding all your trust

Taking what you need
Bite the hand that feeds
You lose your memory and you got no shame

Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have it's truth and now the joke's on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy

Oh nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine

Oh nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine

Oh nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine

Oh nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine
