Well I met a girl named Lady Cobra
Her black heart beat crimson and clover
She gives me chills and fever blisters
She's serving spells and voodoo shakes


Well she just wants to get me high
Stick a needle in my eye
Reeks like hell
Lost in temptation
Rubbing on my inner demons

Don't want a suicide, I don't want  this to end
I just want to be your friend

Cuddle up with me real tight
Talk to me by candlelight
Do you want to play a game of Twister?
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter

Don't want a suicide, I don't want this to end
I just want be your friend

Well I don't want to make you cry
Cross my heart and hope to die
Drawin' blood and lonely stars
Drinking piss for cheap guitars

Don't want a suicide, I don't want this to end
I just want be your friend
