Oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl.
By the way you look i understand
That you were not impressed.
I heard you let that little friend of mine
Take off your party dress.


I'm not going to get too sentimental
Like those other [??] valentines,
'cause i don't know if you are loving some body.
I only know it isn't mine.

Alison, i know this world is killing you.
Oh, alison, my aim is true.

Well i see you've got a husband now.
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying
In the wedding cake?
You used to hold him right in your hand.
Bet he took all he could take.

Sometimes i wish that i could stop you from talking
When i hear the silly things that you say.
I think somebody better put out the big light,
'cause i can't stand to see you this way.

Alison, i know this world is killing you.
Oh, alison, my aim is true.
My aim is true.
