Staring out of my window
Watching the cars go rolling by
My friends are gone
I've got nothing to do
So I sit here patiently
Watching the clock tick so slowly
Gotta get away
Or my brains will explode


Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

See the hills from afar
Standing on my beat up car
The sun went down and the night fills the sky
Now I feel like me once again
As the train comes rolling in
Smoked my boredom gone
Slapped my brains up so high

Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road
Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road

If there's one thing that I need that makes me feel complete
So I go to Christie Road
It's home...
It's home...

It's home...
It's home...
It's home...
