I'll go for miles 'til I find you
You say you want to leave me, but you can't choose
I've gone thru pain every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane, something I can't fight


Don't leave me
Don't leave me

A blank expression covering your face
I'm looking for directions for out of this place
I start to wonder if you'll come back
I feel the rain storming after thunder, I can't hold back

Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me

I'll go for miles 'til I find you
You say you want to leave me, but you can't choose
I've gone thru pain every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane, something I can't fight

Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
