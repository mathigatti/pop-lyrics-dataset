There’s a trouble in the air
A rumble in the streets
A going out of business sale
And a race to bankruptcy


It’s not one to 99, it’s 99 to one
A common cause and a call to arms
For the health of our daughters and our sons

It’s ninety nine revolutions tonight
It’s ninety nine revolutions tonight
It’s ninety nine revolutions tonight
It’s ninety nine revolutions tonight

There’s a rat in the company
A bill on easy street
How the fuck did the working stiff
Become so obsolete?

Hit the lights and bang your drum
And let your flag unfold
Cause history will prove itself
In the hall of justice and lost souls

It’s ninety nine revolutions tonight
It’s ninety nine revolutions tonight
It’s ninety nine revolutions tonight
It’s ninety nine revolutions tonight

We live in troubled times
From the ghettos to an empty suburban home
We live in troubled times
And I’m 99 percent sure that something’s wrong

It’s ninety nine revolutions tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 to work, to work
