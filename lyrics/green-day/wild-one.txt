She
She is my wild one
My heart is in a panic
Her eyes look so manic now
She
Little wild one
My heart is a chaser
She's strung out on razors now


She gave up on Jesus
For living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I'm drinking the Kool-Aid
I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow
Hello

She
She's my wild one
My heart is in danger
From shadows and strangers now
She
Little wild one
She's covered in angels
With demons and halos now

She gave up on Jesus
For living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I'm drinking the Kool-Aid
I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow
Hello

She gave up on Jesus
For living on Venus
All fucked up with nowhere to go
I'm drinking the Kool-Aid
I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow
Hello

Little wild one
My heart is in danger
She's strung out on razors now

My heart is in danger
She's strung out on razors now
