Why should my fun have to end?
For me it's only the beginning
I see my friends begin to age
A short countdown to what end


Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes
Better think again
Cause no one knows

I don't want to cause no harm
But sometimes my actions hurt
Is there something I should find
To make plans for forever

Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes
Better think again
Cause no one knows

Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes
Better think again
Cause no one knows

Does it seem like all your memories fade
You soak up knowledge to fill the space
And still my answer remains...
I don't know
