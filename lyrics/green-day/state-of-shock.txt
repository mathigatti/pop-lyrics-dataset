I'm going in to a state of shock
I can twist, I can hardly walk
Can I hold on for life?
Should I be concerned?


My eyes are rolling in the back of my head
I'm black and blue and I'm in the red
And the silence is so loud
Should I be concerned?

We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
The fire, judgement and demons
And save your last goodbye

My tears are putting out my cigarette
And I'm singing out the alphabet
The way I remember
Should I be concerned?

Make a mess from my amusia
I'm going under anesthesia
I'm holding on for life
Should I be concerned?

We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
The fire, judgement and demons
And save your last goodbye

We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
The fire, judgement and demons
And save your last goodbye
