We're in the world's of forgotten
They're lost inside your memory
You're dragging on, your heart's been broken
As we all go down in history


Where in the world did the time go?
It's where your spirit seems to roam
Like losing faith to our abandon
Or an empty hallway from a broken home

Don't look away
From the arms of a bad dream
Don't look away
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen

I don't feel strange, it's more like haunted
Another moment trapped in time
I can't quite put my finger on it
But it's like a child that was left behind

So where in the world's the forgotten?
Like soldiers from a long lost war
We share the scars from our abandon
And what we remember becomes folklore

Well, don't look away
From the arms of a bad dream
Don't look away
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen

Don't look away
From the arms of a moment
Don't look away
From the arms of tomorrow

Don't look away
From the arms of a moment
Don't look away
From the arms of love

Don't look away
From the arms of a bad dream
Don't look away
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen

Don't look away
From the arms of a moment
Don't look away
From the arms of tomorrow

Don't look away
From the arms of a moment
Don't look away
From the arms of love
