Maybe I'll see you tonight
Maybe I'll see you tonight
Wherever the night takes you
Maybe you'll see me too


The colder it gets
You won't see me anymore
But there's still a chance
I might walk to your door

Maybe the timing's is not right
I won't be seeing you tonight
Maybe I'll see you tonight
Maybe I'll see you tonight
