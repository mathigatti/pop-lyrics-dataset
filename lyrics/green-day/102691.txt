I'm just a mutt and nowhere is my home
Where dignity's land mine in the school of long lost hope
I've panhandled for life because I'm not afraid to beg
Hand me down your lost and founds of second hand regret


You better swallow your pride
Or you're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit

Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I'm not the one
I got no pride

Sects of diconnection and traditions of lost faith
No culture's worth a stream of piss or a bullet in my face
To hell with unity separation'll kill us all
Torn to shreds and disjointed before the final fall

You better swallow your pride
Or you're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit

Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I'm not the one
I got no pride

I got no pride
Close your eyes and die
I got no pride
