Lobotomy, lobotomy, lobotomy, lobotomy!
Ddt did a job on me
Now i am a real sickie
Guess i'll have to break the news
That i got no mind to lose
All the girls are in love with me
I'm a teenage lobotomy


Slugs and snails are after me
Ddt keeps me happy
Now i guess i'll have to tell 'em
That i got no cerebellum
Gonna get my ph.d.
I'm a teenage lobotomy

Hey ho, let's go hey ho, let's go hey ho, let's go hey ho, let's go
They're forming in straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
Blitzkrieg bop

They're piling in the back seat
They're generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
Blitzkrieg bop

Hey ho, let's go shoot'em in the back now
What they want, i don't know
They're all revved up and ready to go

They're forming in straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
Blitzkrieg bop

They're piling in the back seat
They're generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
Blitzkrieg bop

Hey ho, let's go shoot'em in the back now
What they want, i don't know
They're all revved up and ready to go

They're forming in straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
Blitzkrieg bop

They're piling in the back seat
They're generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
Blitzkrieg bop

Hey ho, let's go hey ho, let's go
