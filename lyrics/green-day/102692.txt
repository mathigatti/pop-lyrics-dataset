Ready for a cheap escape
On the brink of self destruction
Widespread panic
Broken glass inside my head
Bleeding down these thoughts of anguish
Mass confusion


Well, the world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shit
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with
I don't care

There's a plague inside of me
Eating at my disposition
Nothing's left
Torn out of reality
Into a state of no opinion
Limp with hate

Well, the world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shit
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with
I don't care

I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out
