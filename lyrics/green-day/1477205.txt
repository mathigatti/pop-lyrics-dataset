Love conquers everytime
When two hearts come to collide
You're the card
In my valentine
And the candy hearts
In my mind


And true love is the rule
And you're nobody's fool
The ship's coming to the light
And it was love at first sight

Baby baby you're the light
And the flame burns in my minds eye
The child bleeds into bliss
And I knew it from the first kiss

Tonight hearts collide
Hearts collide, hearts collide

The triumph bleeds into bliss
And I knew it from the first kiss

Tonight hearts collide
Hearts collide, hearts collide
Tonight hearts collide
Hearts collide, hearts collide
Tonight hearts collide
Hearts collide, hearts collide
Tonight hearts collide
Hearts collide, hearts collide
