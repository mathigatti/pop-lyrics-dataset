All my life trouble follows me like a mystery girl
I’ve been chasing down a memory like a mystery girl
I’ve been getting lost searching my soul all around this town
I took a wrong turn at growing up and it’s freaking me out


Back at school it never made much sense
Now I pay but I can pay attention
Teaches me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die I guess
But that’s the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex, drugs &amp; violence
English, math &amp; science
Safety in numbers
Give me, give me danger

I wanna be an imbecil?
But Jesus made me that way

All my life I’ve been running wild like a runaway
Whereever the night takes me like a  stowaway

Back at school it never made much sense
Now I pay but I can pay attention
Teaches me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die I guess
But that’s the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex, drugs &amp; violence
English, math &amp; science
Safety in numbers
Give me, give me danger
