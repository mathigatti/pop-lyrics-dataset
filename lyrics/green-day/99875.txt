Seventeen and strung out on confusion
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion


I've found out what it takes to be a man
Now mom and dad'll never understand

Secrets collecting dust, but never forget
Skeletons come to life in my closet

I've found out what it takes to be a man
Now mom and dad'll never understand
What's happening to me

Seventeen and coming clean for the first time
I finally figured out myself for the first time

I've found out what it takes to be a man
Now mom and dad'll never understand
What's happened to me
