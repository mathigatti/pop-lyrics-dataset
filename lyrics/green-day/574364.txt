You don't look at me no more
And I don't look at you
But that's alright pretty baby
'Cause I'm just singing a song to you
Telling me that you don't feel the same
But that's alright pretty baby
'Cause I'm child of myself bitching


Sometimes I don't mind at all
Then again sometimes maybe
Feeling the whole world's going to fall apart
And I don't think you feel the same
That's alright pretty baby
'Cause I don't mind a bit sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
And I don't feel better (sometimes)
And I don't feel better (sometimes)
And it all points to me remember
Sometimes

You don't talk to me no more
And I don't talk to you
But that's alright pretty baby
'Cause I'm just looking for someone to screw
Telling me that you don't feel the same
That's alright pretty baby
'Cause I'm a child of myself bitching

Sometimes I don't mind at all
Then again sometimes maybe
Feeling the whole world's going to fall apart
And I don't think you feel the same
That's alright pretty baby
'Cause I don't mind a bit
Sometimes I don't mind at all
Well Sometimes
I don't mind at all

Sometimes
Well sometimes
I don't mind I don't mind
I don't mind I don't I don't mind
Sometimes I don't mind at all
