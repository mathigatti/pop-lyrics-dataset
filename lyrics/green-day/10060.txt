Your rise and fall, back up against the wall
What goes around is coming back and haunting you
It's time to quit 'cause you ain't worth the shit
Under my shoes or the piss on the ground


No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie or tell you all the things you wannahear
'Cause I hate you  (x4)

I heard you're sick, sucked on that cancer stick
A throbbing tumor and a radiation high
Shit out of luck, and now your time is up
It brings me pleasure just to know your gonna die

No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie or tell you all the things you wannahear
'Cause I hate you

Dickhead, fuckface
Cock smoking, mother fucking asshole
Dirty twat, waste of semen
I hope you die

Red eye, code blue, I'd like to strangle you
And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull
When you go down head first into the ground
I'll stand above you just to piss on your grave
No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie or tell you all the things you wannahear
'Cause I hate you
