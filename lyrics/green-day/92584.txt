Stranded
Lost inside myself
My own worst friend and my own closest enemy


I'm branded
Maladjusted
Never trusted anyone, let alone myself

I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Elected
The rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot

No meaning
And no healing
Self loathing freak and introverted deviot

I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Stranded
Lost inside myself
My own worst friend and my own closest enemy

Elected
The rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot

I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

I'm getting pissed
I'm a worthless pessimist
I'm a loner in a claustrophobic mind
