Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round
Like a ferris wheel like it's breaking down
Drinking angel's piss, gonna crash and burn
I just want some action so gimme my turn


Like a Chinese company conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in high-fidelity for me too

Can you hear the sound coming over the hill?
Gotta move my feet, it's coming in for the kill
Ba-baby, baby it's a blow out
Like a nuclear bomb and it won't be long 'til I detonate

Like a Chinese company conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in high-fidelity for me too

Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round
Like a ferris wheel like that's breaking down
Scream, scream, screaming bloody murder
Like a nuclear bomb it won’t be long ’til I detonate

Like a Chinese company conspiracy
It’s the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It’s looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in hi-fidelity for me too

Ten, nine, eight, sev, six, five, four, three
5-4-3-2-1
