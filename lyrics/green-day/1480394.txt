Can you hear the sound of the static noise?
Blasting out in stereo
Cater to the class and the paranoid
Music to my nervous system
Advertising love and religion
Murder on the airwaves
Slogans on the brink of corruption
Visions of blasphemy, war and peace
Oh oh screaming at you


I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

Billboard on the rise in the dawn's landscape
Working your insanity
Tragic a'la madness and concrete
Coca cola execution
Conscience on a cross and
You're hearts in a vice
Squeezing out your state of mind
Are what you own that you cannot buy?
What a fucking tragedy, strategy
Oh oh screaming at you

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

Hey hey it's the static age
Well this is how the west was won
Hey hey it's the static age mellenium

All I wanna know
Is a god-damned thing
Not what's in the medicine
All I wanna do
Is I want to breathe
Batteries are not included
What's the latest way that a man can die
Screaming hallelujah?
Singing out "the dawn's early light"
The silence of the rotten, forgotten
Oh oh screaming at you

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
The static age
