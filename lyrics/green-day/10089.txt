Billie Jo,e it's certainly is exciting to meet you here
At the recording studio right after you just made your very first record,
How does it feel?


Umm... wonderfull!

She smashed the radio with the board of education
Turn up the static left of the state of the nation

Turn up the flame, step on the gass
Burning the flag at half mast
She's a rebel's forgotten son
An expert of the revolution

She is the first voice of the last ones in the line
She'll drag the lake to keep the vendetta alive

Bring in the head of the government
The dog ate the document
Somebody shot the president
And no one knows where Maria went?

Maria, Maria, Maria,
Where did you go?

Be careful what you're offering
Your breath lacks the conviction
Drawing the line in the dirt
Because the last decision
... is no.

She smashed the radio with the board of education
Turn up the static left of the state of the nation

Turn up the flame, step on the gass
Burning the flag at half mast
She's a rebel's forgotten son
An expert of the revolution

Maria, Maria, Maria,
Where did you go?

Maria, Maria, Maria,
Where did you go?
