I lock myself inside my room
I wannabe alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wannabe alone
It's been disturbed by my thoughts
I wannabe alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wannabe alone


Please don't think I'm crazy
I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy
To hell with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone
This conflict is my own
Keep your sources away from me
That's all

I lock myself inside my room
I wannabe alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wannabe alone
It's been disturbed by my thoughts
I wannabe alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wannabe alone

Please don't think I'm crazy
I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy
To hell with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone
This conflict is my own
Keep your sources away from me
That's all

I lock myself inside my room
I wannabe alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wannabe alone
It's been disturbed by my thoughts
I wannabe alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wannabe alone

Please don't think I'm crazy
I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy
To hell with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone
This conflict is my own
Keep your sources away from me
That's all

I wannabe alone!
