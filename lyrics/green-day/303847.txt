I got a rock and roll band
I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
And another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house
I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums
And I can play the guitar
I got a kid in new york
I got a kid in the bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin'
In over 22 days
So get off my case
