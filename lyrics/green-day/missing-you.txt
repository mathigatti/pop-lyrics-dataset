Waking up, feeling naked
In my closest idle room that's vacant


Lost my nerve, it's unnerving
I know there's something i'm forgetting

I searched the moon i lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, i hit the streets
I'm pounding the pavement
Looking

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around
And i am a complete disaster
I'm missing you

Remember, it was the first time
I told you i loved you at the bus station

Don't forget, 'cause it's not over
I'm not lost 'cause i'm just missing you

I searched the moon i lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, i hit the streets
I'm pounding the pavement
Looking

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around
And i am a complete disaster
I'm missing you

Well she's my blood,
And she's my soul
I get so lost,
Out in the cold

I feel so far,
Like this lone star
It gets so hard,
When i'm missing you

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around
And i am a fucking disaster
I'm missing you
