Now I rest my head from
Such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness
That had you on my mind
Those days are gone and now it seems
As if I'll get some rest
But now and then I'll see you again
And it puts my heart to the test


So when do all my troubles gonna end?
I'm understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you

As the days go on I wonder
(Will this ever end?)
I find it hard to keep control
When you're with your boyrfriend
I do not mind if all I am is
Just a friend to you
But all I want to know right now
Is if you think about me too... ?
