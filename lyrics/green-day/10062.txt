(Head down, head down, head down)
(Oooh...you understand me? Ah shit)


Waiting in a room
All dressed up and bound and gagged up
To a chair
It's so unfair
I don't dare move, for the pain
She puts me through is what I need
So make it bleed...

I'm in distress, oh mistress
I confess so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight
You know I will obey, so please
Don't make me beg
For blood, sex and booze you give me

Say I'm disturbed
But It's what I deserve, another lesson
To be learned… from a girl called kill
My head is in the gutter
Thank you sir, strike up another mandolin
Of discipline
Throw me to the dogs
Let them eat my flesh down
To the wood
It feels so good

I'm in distress, oh mistress
I confess so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight
You know I will obey, so please
Don't make me beg
For blood, sex and booze you give me

Say I'm disturbed
But It's what I deserve, another lesson
To be learned… from a girl called kill

I'm in distress, oh mistress
I confess so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight
You know I will obey, so please
Don't make me beg
For blood, sex and booze you give me
