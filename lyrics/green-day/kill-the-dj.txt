Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Your thoughts are so unholy
In the holiest of holes
On ward Christian soldiers
Filled with jive'e mind control


The blood left on the dance floor
Running, running red
The bullet that you asked for kill you to your death
Unless you..

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
The voices in my head are saying "shoot the fucker down"

We are the vultures
The dirtiest kind
The cultures wars
In your heart and your mind

Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Beer goggles left in the club, a pocket full of pills
The Sodom and Gommorah, in the century of thrills

The blood left on the dance floor
Running, running red
The bullet that you asked for kill you to your death
Unless you..

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Hold him under water til the mother fucker drowns

We are the vultures
The dirtiest kind
We'll cut you once
In your heart and your mind

Ohhhh

Shit's about to get you, boy
Shoot the fucker down!

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucker down

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
The voices in my head are saying "shoot the fucker down"
