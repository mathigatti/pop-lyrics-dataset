I'm taking down all my enemies 'cause they're all so fucking useless
A bunch of shit-talking drama queens and they're all filled with excuses
I wanna find me a better scene where it's not the same opinion
I'd rather go to a funeral than into this high school reunion


April Fool, but you're falling in love
But now you're sucking on a doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's so cruel crushing bastard crime
And you're a stupid motherfucker and you're doing the time cause

(Refrão)
We're all crazy, you're all crazy now
Well we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
Loss of control
Loss of control

Hanging out all by myself, at least I'm in good company
Hey, isn't that old Whatshisface that I see walking down the street?
I'm gonna hide in the shadows 'cause I really got nothing to say
We never had anything in common and I never liked you anyway

April Fool, but you're falling in love
When you're sucking on a doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's so cruel crushing son of a bitch
And you're a stupid motherfucker
serve your shit to the pigs cause

(Refrão)
We're all crazy, you're all crazy now
Well we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
Loss of control

(Solo)

April Fool, but you're falling in love
But now you're sucking on a doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's so cruel crushing bastard crime
And you're a stupid motherfucker and you're doing the time cause

(Refrão)
We're all crazy, you're all crazy now
Well we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
Loss of control
Loss of control
