I was a young boy that had big plans
Now I'm just another shitty old man
I don't have fun and I hate everything
This world owes me so fuck you


Glory days don't mean shit to me
I drank a six pack of apathy
Life's a bitch and so am I
The world owes me so fuck you

Wasted youth and a fistful of ideals
I had a young and optimistic point of view
Wasted youth and a fistful of ideals
I had a young and optimistic point of view

I've decomposed yet my gut's getting fat
Oh my God, I'm turning out like my Dad
I'm always rude, I've got a bad attitude
The world owes me so fuck you

The wife's a nag and the kids fucking up
I don't have sex 'cause I can't get it up
I'm just a grouch sitting on the couch
The world owes me so fuck you
