I don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care (4x)


I don't care.....

Everyone is so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From anaheim to the middle east
We are the stories and disciples of
The jesus of suburbia

Land of make believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make believe
And i don't believe
And i don't care! (5x)
