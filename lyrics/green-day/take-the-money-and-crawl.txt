High on a low life
Hit me with a dull knife
Sweet sour sickness
Can I get a witness?


This is the wildlife, I'm gonna take a dive
Take the money and crawl
Do I dare say please when I'm on my knees?
Take the money and crawl

Illegal tender
Going on a bender
Cold-blooded killers
Of all motherfuckers

I'm a nervous wreck, enough to make you sick
Take the money and crawl
Oh, yeah, it's just my luck, but I don't give a fuck
Take the money and crawl

This is the wildlife, I'm gonna take a dive
Take the money and crawl
Do I dare say please when I'm on my knees?
Take the money and crawl

So you can take a walk or you can suck my cock
Take the money and crawl
Oh, yeah, it's just my luck, but I don't give a fuck
Take the money and crawl
