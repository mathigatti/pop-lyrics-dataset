Looking back upon my life
And the places that I've been
Pictures, faces, girls I've loved
I try to remember when
Faded memories on the wall
Some names I have forgotten
But each one is a memory I
Look back on so often.


I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there

Looking back what I have done
There's lots more life to live
At times I feel overwhelmed
I question what I can give
But I don't let it get me down
Or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am
I always have tomorrow

Looking back upon my life
Faded memories on the wall
Looking now at who I am
I don't let it get me down
