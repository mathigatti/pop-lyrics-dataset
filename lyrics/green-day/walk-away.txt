This time
I gotta put my guard down
Pick myself up off the ground
And take the pain


It’ll pass
The swelling never really lasts
But the scar remains
Remind me that I’m still living

Well, it’s not too late
And it’s really not worth the fight
No one’s right
Well, it’s time to walk away

Walk away

Well, the bigger that you come
The harder you’re gonna fall
Walk away

Did you win?
Or maybe, did you lose?
Now you’re gonna lick your wounds, anyway
When it comes back to you

When you fall
You’re gonna need a parachute
Or, a used pair of shoes to go
And walk away

Well, it’s not too late
And it’s really not worth the fight
No one’s right
Well, it’s time to walk away

Walk away

Well, the bigger that you come
The harder you’re gonna fall
Walk away

And the bigger that you come
The harder you’re gonna fall
Walk away

Walk away
