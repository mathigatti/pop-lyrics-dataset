Lights out, here comes the night
As the darkness falls over the light


Lights out, there goes the day
And this fear that comes won't go away

And I'm losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And I'm living out my private suicide

Lights out, I lost myself
In the space between heaven and hell
Lights out, finding my way
Till I waste my time losing the way

And I'm losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And I'm living out my private suicide

Lights out

Lights out, here comes the night
As the darkness falls over the light

Lights out, I lost myself
In the space between heaven and hell

And I'm losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And I'm living out my private suicide
