I'm running late to somewhere now
I don't want to be
Where the future and promises ain't what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side ever get so dull?


All grown up and medicated
I'm high on cellular waves
I put the riot in patriot
And we all die in threes

I got a scene in the middle of the road
I'm gonna take my time
I shop online so I can bolt
At the speed of life

I'm like a drone way up in the sky
I'm a shooting star
There's a soldier that's freaking out
P.S. this is war

All grown up and medicated
I'm high on cellular waves
I put the riot in patriot
And we all die in threes

All we want is money and guns
A new catastrophe
Here goes nothing, there's nothing to lose
It's a small price we pay
When we all die in threes

Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now

Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now

Hallelujah! I found my soul
Under the sofa pillows
Congratulations, I found myself

Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
