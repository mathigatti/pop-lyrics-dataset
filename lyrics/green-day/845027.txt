I saw daddy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe
Last night
He didn't see me creep
down the stairs to have a peek
[Mike screams "Oh GOD!"]
He thought I was up in the bedroom fast asleep


Then, I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the Christmas tree last night
there must be some mistake
was I really awake?
I move in closer, but better look away

[Mike and Billie make barfing noises]
