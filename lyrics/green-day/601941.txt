My heart is beating from me
I am standing all alone
Please call me only
if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live


In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no sign of hope
The stems and seeps of the last of the dope
The's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust.
The fixture in the city of lust

"What the hell's your name?
What's your pleasure and what's your pain?
Do you dream too much?
Do you think what you need is a cruth?"

In the crowd of pain, St. Jimmy comes whitout any shame
He says "We're fucked up, but we're not the same
and mom and dad are the ones you can blame"

Jimmy died, today
He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind
In my own private suicide
