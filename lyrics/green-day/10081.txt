I see you
Down on the front line
Such a sight for sore eyes
You're a suicide makeover


Plastic eyes
Looking through a numbskull
Self-effaced, what's his face
You erased yourself so shut up
You don't let up

You have a growth that must be treated
Like a severed severe pain in the neck
You can smell it but you can't see it
No explanation identified 'cause
You don't know
You don't say
And you got no reply

Hey you, where did you come from?
Got a head full of lead
You're an inbred bastard son

All dressed up, redblooded, a mannequin
Do or die, no reply
Don't deny that you're synthetic
You're pathetic

You have a growth that must be treated
Like a severed severe pain in the neck
You can smell it but you can't see it
No explanation identified 'cause
You don't know
You don't say
And you got no reply

I see you
Down on the front line
Such a sight for sore eyes
You're a suicide makeover

You don't know
You don't say
And you got no reply

You don't know
You don't say
And you got no reply
