I text a postcard, sent to you
Did it go through?
Sending all my love to you
You are the moonlight of my life every night
Giving all my love to you
My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sending all my love to you


With every breath that I am worth
Here on Earth
I'm sending all my love to you
So if you dare to second guess
You can rest assured
That all my love's for you

My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sending all my love to you

My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
Did I ever make it through?
