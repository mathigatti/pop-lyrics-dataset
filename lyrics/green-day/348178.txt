Minnesota Girl
Sittin' on the hood of a camaro
Walkin' shooting stars across the earth
Counting all the bites from the mosquitoes
There goes my Minnesota girl


Lazy days
Gone without notice
In a daze... with faraway eyes

Driving to a closed spot Wednesday afternoon
There goes my Minnesota girl

In a daze
Go without notice
Lazy days....with faraway eyes

Countin' from the pieces we have been through
Here comes my Minnesota girl
There goes  my Minnesota girl
