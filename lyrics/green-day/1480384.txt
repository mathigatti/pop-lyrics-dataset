She puts her makeup on
Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book of conspiracies
Right in her hand
She is paranoid like
Endangered species headed into extinction
She is one of a kind
She's the last of the American Girls


She wears her overcoat
For the coming of the nuclear winter
She is riding her bike
Like a fugitive of critical mass
She's on a hunger strike
For the ones who won't make it for dinner
She makes enough to survive
For a holiday of working class

Shes a runaway of the establishment incorporated.
She won't cooperate
She's the last of the American Girls

She plays her vinyl records
Singing songs on the eve of destruction
She's a sucker for
All the criminals breaking the laws
She will come in first
For the end of Western civilization
She's an endless war
She's a hero for the lost cause
Like a hurricane
In the heart of devastation
She's a natural disaster
She's the last of the American Girls

She puts her makeup on
Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book of conspiracies
Right in her hand
She will come in first
For the end of Western civilization
She's a natural disaster
She's the last of the American Girls
