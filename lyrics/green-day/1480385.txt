Sing us a song of the century
Louder than bombs and eternity
The era of static and contraband
Leading us into the promised land
Tell me a story that's by candlelight
Waging a war and losing the fight


Keep sing the song of the century
Of panic and promise and prosperity
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing up the stars for me
