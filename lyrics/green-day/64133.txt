I woke up on the wrong side of the floor
Made made my way through the front door
Broke my engagement with myself
Perfect picture of bad health
Another notch acratched on my belt
The future just ain't what it used to be


I got a new start on a dead end road
Peaked. Peaked out on reaching new lows
Owe I pald off all my debts to myself
Perfect picture of bad health
Another notch acratched on my belt
The future's in my living room

Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of gun
Uptight I'm a nag with a gun
