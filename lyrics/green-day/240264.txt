Yeah, we say making changes starts
With the little things you do
Revolution begins at home
But for most of us it ends there to


We're doing something
We're making changes
Like changing the kind of crap we buy
We say it makes a difference
But that's just another lie

It used to be and Us Them
And You and Me
And now we can't reach our full potential
Wiithout a common enemy

A real war to fight against
Instead of our petty disagreements
But how can I rationalize
My life during wartime, lie

A call to action and a reaction
Taking our lives in our own hands
Instead of sitting around and talking
About the same old stupid bands

But war is going on right now
And I'm not doing anything about it
Without a crowd I'm not so loud
I can't do anything by myself
But that's just another lie
