[originally by the who]

I don't mind all the guys dancing with my girl
That's fine, i know them all pretty well
And i know sometimes i must get out in the light
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright...
The kids are alright....


Sometimes, i know i gotta get away
Bells chime, i know i gotta get away
And i know if i don't, i'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright...
The kids are alright....

I know if i go things would be a lot better for her
I had this plan but her folks wouldn't let her
I don't mind, i feel i gotta get away
Bells chime, i know i gotta get away
And i know if i don't i'll go out of my fuckin' mind
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright...
The kids are alright....
The kids are alright....
The kids are alright....
