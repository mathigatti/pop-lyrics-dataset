This whiskey sour, amateur hour
Raise your glass and toast your friends
Someday we will fight again


Well, your enemies, your tragedies
Pocket knives and rusty chains
Where the hell is the old gang at?

And all the losers, can't even win for losing
And the beginners don't even know what song they're singing

When there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound

This broken scene is turning green
A brass knuckles left in the rain
Death wish kids among the living

I wanna ride on the divided
Anything but the mainstream
Where the fuck is your old gang man?

And all the losers, can't even win for losing
And the beginners don't even know what song they're singing

When there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound

So long
Didn't even say goodnight
So long
There's no where to go when you're hiding in plain sight

When there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound
