and just because you think i am a fool
and don't seem to want to listen
doesn't mean i didn't hear you
or wasn't paying any attention
'cause i've said all that i have to say
and i will return to you/on some other foreign day.


hear the lies
tell a joke
bored for life
indwelling in your sociality
i'm a mistake waiting to happen....
i cannot dream if i am a fly upon your wall
and just because you cannot see me
doesn't mean i'm never there
because you have got a thing
that i really like
a kiss or two on just because
doesn't mean that i think of you.
