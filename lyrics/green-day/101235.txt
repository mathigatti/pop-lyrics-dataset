Take away the sensation inside
Bittersweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbing toothache of the mind
I can't take this feeling anymore


Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me novacaine

Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feeling and that's alright
Jimmy says it's better than here
I'll tell you why

Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me novacaine

Oh, novacaine

Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright
Tell me, Jimmy, I won't feel a thing
So give me novacaine
