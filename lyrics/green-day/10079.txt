You pushed me once too far again
I'd like to break your fucking teeth
Stick a knife in the center of your back
You better grow some eyes in the back of your head
I fight dirty, just like your looks
Can't take, take, take, anymore


Take back, take back
Take back, take back

The taste of bad blood on the tip of my tongue
An eye for an eye
Gun for a gun
Cold-cocked and I'm taking back what's mine
Expect it when you're least expecting it
No loss of love, the smell of regret
Lights out can't take anymore

Take back, take back
Take back, take back

Shit
