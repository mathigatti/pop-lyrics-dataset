Haushinka is a girl with a peculiar name
I met her on the eve of my birthday
Did she know, did she know, before she went away
Does she know? Does she know? But it's too damn late


This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
Now she's gone, now she's gone, she's all gone

All I have now is a memory to date
A cheap hat and cigarettes, and a peculiar name
I didn't know, I didn't know, before she went away
I know now, I know now, and it's too damn late

This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
Now she's gone, now she's gone, she's all gone

Will she ever find her way?
I'm too damn young to be too late, but am I?
Yet again I'm kicking myself
And I'll be here in battle scars
Waiting for you, waiting for you now

This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
This girl has gone far away, now she's gone
Now she's gone, now she's gone, she's all gone
