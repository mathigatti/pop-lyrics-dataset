Who the hell are you to tell me what I am
And what's my master plan
What makes you think that it includes you?
Self-righteous wealth
Stop flattering yourself
So when the smoke clears here I am
Your reject all-American


Sucking up you social sect
Making you a nervous wreck
To hell and back and hell again I've gone
You're not my type
Not my type

What's the difference between you and me?
I do what I want, and you do what you're told
So listen up and shut the hell up
It ain't no big deal
And I'll see you in hell
So when the smoke clears here I am
Your reject all-American

Falling from grace, right on my face
To hell and back and hell again I've gone
