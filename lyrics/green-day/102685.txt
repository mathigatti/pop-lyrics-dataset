I'm all busted up
Broken bones and nasty cuts
Accidents will happen
But this time I can't get up


She comes to check on me
Making sure I'm on my knees
After all she's the one
Who put me in his state

Is she ultra-violent? Is she disturbed?
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh, God, she's killing me!

For now I'll lie around
Hell, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true

Is she ultra-violent? Is she disturbed?
I better tell that her I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh, God, she's killing me!

Looking out my window
For someone that's passing by
No one knows I'm locked in here
All I do is cry

For now I'll lie around
Hell that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true
