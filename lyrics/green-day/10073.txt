Wherever you go, you know I'll be there
If you go far, you know I'll be there
Well, I'll go anywhere so I'll see you there
You place the name, you know I'll be there
You name the time, you know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere, so I'll see you there


I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there, not far behind
I will dare, keep in mind
I'll be there for you

Where there's the truth
You know I'll be there
Amongst the lies
You know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there

I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there, not far behind
I will dare, keep in mind
I'll be there for you

All right!!!

If you should fall, you know I'll be there
To catch the call. you know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere so I'll see you there

I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there, not far behind
I will dare, keep in mind
I don't care
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
