I'm not part of your elite, I'm just alright
Class structures waving colors
Bleeding from my throat


Not subservient to you, I'm just alright
Down classed by the powers that be
Give me loss of hope

Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well I know I'm not alright

What's my price and will you pay it if it's alright?
Take it from my dignity
And waste it till it's dead

Throw me back into the gutter 'cause it's alright
Find another pleasure fucker
Drag them down to hell

Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well I know I'm not alright

Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well, I know I'm not alright
