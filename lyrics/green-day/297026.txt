I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After 10 cups of coffee and you're still not here
Dreaming of a song but something went wrong
But I can't tell anyone, cause no one's here
Left me here alone and I should have stayed home
After 10 cups of coffee I'm thinking
(Where'd you go?)


Nobody likes you, everyone left you
(Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you havin' fun
(Where'd you go?)

Everyone left you, nobody likes you
(Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you havin'fum
(Where'd you go?)
