Seasons greeting cards and xmas...
Lights light up the city
At the end of the year!


This time I got no resolutions
Giving thanks for nothing
But joy into the year

Tonight friends are what its worth
Peace and love on Earth
And another year giving thanks again

The sleigh bells deck the halls with good will
Say a prayer the lost souls
Christmas time of the year

Tonight friends are what its worth
Peace and love on Earth
And another year giving thanks again

Somewhere around a plastic manger
Giving thanks to strangers
Christmas time of the year
