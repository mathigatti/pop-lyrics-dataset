I aint a politician, I'm just a bad musician
Whatcha gonna do for me?
Do you have the taste for sex and blood and hate
Or really good Isd?
I'd like to start a band with you
I'll sing and you can learn to play the tambourine
Here's an invitation, no time for hesitation
Come and join my family


I live inside of you
But you don't belong to me
I'm a reflection of you
What's my recipe?

A half a cup satanical, a teaspoon puritanical
Stirred with a bloody hand
A quarter cup messiahcal, a sprinkle of maniacal
And now I'm a mechanical man

I'll give you the heads up
Come on and get your legs up
This is called 'the family jam'
Together we'll stay hidden away for Armageddon
And stick it to the man

I live inside of you
But you don't belong to me
I'm a reflection of you
What's my recipe?

A half a cup satanical, a teaspoon puritanical
Stirred with a bloody hand
A quarter cup messiahcal, a sprinkle of maniacal
And now I'm a mechanical man

Watch this shit, woman! Gonna learn somethin' right now

Open up the curtains, then we'll start a hurtin'
Come on let's do the creppy-crawl
The show's about to go down
Come on, I got the low-down
Together we'll make holywood fall

I live inside of you
But you don't belong to me
I'm a reflection of you
What's my recipe?

I live inside of you
But you don't belong to me
I'm a reflection of you
You look at me and what do you see?

A half a cup satanical, a teaspoon puritanical
Stirred with a bloody hand
A quarter cup messiahcal, a sprinkle of maniacal
And now I'm a mechanical man

A half a cup satanical, a teaspoon puritanical
Stirred with a bloody hand
A quarter cup messiahcal, a sprinkle of maniacal
And now I'm a mechanical man
