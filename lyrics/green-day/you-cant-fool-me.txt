I see you every night when you go on TV
Waiting at
I got it through my head you're not coming back
Gotta take your time if you're mooching off your friends


You can't fool me
Cause I know what you say
What you say just can't be
You scared the hell out of me
But you can't fool me

Every damn night's about talkin' shit, bro
Every damn night I walk on my streets
What can I say when I got you
Better hold your when I meet you half the way

You can't fool me
Cause I know what you say
What you say just can't be
You scared the hell out of me
But you can't fool me

You can't fool me
Cause I know what you say
What you say just can't be
You scared the hell out of me
But you can't fool me

You can't fool me
Cause I know what you say
What you say just can't be
You scared the hell out of me
But you can't fool me
