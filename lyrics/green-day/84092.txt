Clenching my teeth tight 
My head is like a sponge 
Give it to me free
I wanna get ripped off
 
And drown in the airwaves 
Another fatal wreck 
On the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves 
It all amuses me 


For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell 
Another wise ingrate
Bring me blood and pain 
Of a stranger's fate 
Give it all away
Give it to me now

I'm desensitized 
I wanna watch the bomb 
Blow the masses high
I wanna get ripped off 

And drown in the airwaves 
Another fatal wreck 
On the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves 
It all amuses me 

For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell 
Another wise ingrate
Bring me blood and pain 
Of a stranger's fate 
Give it all away
I wanna get ripped off 

And drown in the airwaves 
Another fatal wreck 
On the information highway

So go ahead and kill yourselves 
It all amuses me 
For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell 
Another wise ingrate
