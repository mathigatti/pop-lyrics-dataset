Your gonna miss me miss me when I'm gone
Your gonna miss me miss me when I'm gone
Can't you see there's something wrong
Gonna miss me miss me when I'm gone


On a night just like tonight
Bellow my window pussies fight
I'm gonna be so far away
Exactly like you are today
You must have thought you really scored
'Cause we're "The Angel and the Jerk"
You know I love to be ignored
Just take for granted all my work

Your gonna miss me miss me when I'm gone
Your gonna miss me miss me when I'm gone
Can't you see there's something wrong
Your gonna miss me miss me when I'm gone

Look at me
Who do you see?
Am I a mirror to your moods?

Today's the day
I break away
I'm pulling on my walking boots

Your gonna miss me miss me when I'm gone
Your gonna miss me miss me when I'm gone
Can't you see there's something wrong?
Gonna miss me miss me when I'm gone

I always hope you'd be the one
That's gonna meet me eye-to-eye
I must be brighter than the sun
Or else you've gone completely shy
Am I handy poltergeist?
By day a busy little elf
A saint to rival Jesus Christ
You'd better feed and clothe yourself

Your gonna miss me miss me
