Well, I've got a fever
A non-believer
I'm in a state of grace
For I am the Caesar
I'm gonna seize the day
Well, call of the Banshee, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
As God is my witness
The infidels are gonna pay


Well, call the assassin
The orgasm
A spasm of love and hate
For what will divide us?
The righteous and the meek
Well, call of the wild, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Well, death to the girl at the end of the serenade

Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite

Well, I am a killjoy from Detroit
I drink from a well of rage
I feed off the weakness with all my love
Well, call up the captain, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Death to the lover that you were dreaming of

Well, This is a stand off
A Molotov cocktail
On the house
You thought I was a write off
You better think again
Well, call the peacemaker, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm gonna send you back to the place where it all began

Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite

Well now the caretaker's the undertaker
Now I'm gonna go out and get the peacemaker
This is the neo St. Valentine's massacre
Well, call up the Gaza, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
