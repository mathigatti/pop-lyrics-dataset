Youngblood
She's my little youngblood


Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Punch drunk and youngblood

She's a loner, not a stoner
Bleeding heart and the soul of Ms. Teresa
Supernova, Cherry Cola
She's the cedar in the trees of Minnesota

I'm a rough boy around the edges
Getting drunk and falling into hedges
She's my weakness, fucking genius
Swear to God and I'm not even superstitious

Youngblood

Youngblood
She's my little youngblood

Youngblood

Youngblood
Punch drunk and youngblood

I wanna hold you like a gun
We'll shoot the moon into the sun
Alright, alright

Are you stranded like I'm stranded?
Do you wanna watch the world fall to pieces?
Are you broken like I'm broken?
Are you restless?
She said: Fuck you, I'm from Oakland!
