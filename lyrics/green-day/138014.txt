Every time I'm falling down
You take the reprecussions
Headaches and anxieties
Advancing my frustrations
Rushings of my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me
Stuck with me
Hand up your soul to my wrist
And I'll vow my trust to you
Moving here I always thought
I realized you've imagined
Rushings of my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me
Stuck with me


Rushings of my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me
Stuck with me
