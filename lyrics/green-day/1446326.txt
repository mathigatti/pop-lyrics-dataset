Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after


Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, "Go slow, I fall behind"
The second hand unwinds

CHORUS:
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

CHORUS:

You said, "Go slow, I fall behind"
The second hand unwinds

CHORUS:

Time after time ...
