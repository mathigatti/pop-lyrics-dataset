Things I Heard Today 
Well the things that I heard today
It's not worth listening or to say
Struggle hold you can't get out of
I've got no love for you
And the day is dragging on and on
It makes you feel that much more alone
As its getting faster
No disaster
Once you say..how long.. 
How long can we go on
I hear it all going wrong
So shut your hole
There's something wrong with
The things I heard today 


There's always talking and you say shut up
You've got your problems with what's going on
Your tragedy is going stale
You're on a bridge and you cant budge
Well the Saturday night is getting old
All the week you're doing what you're told
You start the fight and you pull the plug
Next morning your face down in the mud 

How long can we go on
I hear it going on and on and on
So shut your hole
There's nothing wrong with
The things I heard today... 

They talk you say shut up
You've got your problems with what's going on
You tragedy is going stiff
You're on a bridge and you cant budge
Well the Saturday night is getting old
All the week you're doing what you're told
You start the fight and you pull the plug
Next morning your face down in the mud 

How long can we go on
I hear it all going, going wrong
So shut your hole
There's nothing wrong with
The things I heard today...
The things I heard today...
