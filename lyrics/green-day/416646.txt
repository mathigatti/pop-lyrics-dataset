Always tryin' to clean up my catastrophes
Taking full responsibility
Living my life like every day is the last
Remodeling the wreckage of my past


But when it comes to you
I know i said i do
But i don't, no i don't

You're unforgiven so go on living
Knowing that i've unforgiven you
And my thanksgiving
Came the day i saw it was okay
To unforgive you

Confessing every sin doesn't make me a saint
Even though it's obvious i've changed
Once i forgave you but i did not forget
Now i'm taking back everything i said

You're unforgiven so go on living
Knowing that i've unforgiven you
And my thanksgiving
Came the day i saw it was okay
To unforgive you
