I wanna be your Dominated Love Slave 
Want to be the one that takes the Pain 
You can spank me when I don't behave 
Mack me in the forehead with a chain 


Cause I love feeling dirty 
And I love feeling cheap 
And I love it when you hurt me 
So drive those staples deep 

I want you to slap me 
Call me naughty 
Put a beltsander against my skin 
I Want to feel pain all over my body 
Can't wait to get punished for my sins 

Cause I love feeling dirty 
And I love feeling cheap 
And I love it when you hurt me 
So drive those staples deep 

And I love feeling dirty 
And I love feeling cheap 
And I love it when you hurt me 
So drive those staples
