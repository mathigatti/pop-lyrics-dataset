[Part 1: The Death of St. Jimmy]

[Billie Joe]
My heart is beating from me
I am standing all alone
Please call me only
If you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live


In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no sign of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
The fixture in the city of lust

What the hell's your name?
What's your pleasure and what's your pain?
Do you dream too much?
Do you think what you need is a cruth?

In the crowd of pain, St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says: We're fucked up -, but we're not the same
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame

Jimmy died today
He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind
It's my own private suicide

[Part 2: East 12th St.]

[Billie Joe]
And nobody cares
And nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
And nobody cares
And nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?

Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on east 12th st
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffe with the underbelly
His life is on the line with anxiety now
And she had enough
And he had plenty

Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

So far away
I don't wanna stay
Get me out of here right now
I just wanna be free
Is there a possibility?
Get me out of here right now
This life like dream ain't for me

[Part 3: Nobody Likes You!]

[Mike Dirnt]
I fell asleep while watching spike tv
After 10 cups of coffee
And you're still not here
Dreaming of a song
When something went wrong
But I can't tell anyone
'Cause you're not here
Left me here alone
When I should have stayed home
After 10 cups of coffee
I'm thinking
Where'd you go?

Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They're all out without you havin' fun
Everyone left you
Nobody likes you
They're all out without you havin'fun
Where'd you go?

[Part 4: Rock and Roll Girlfriend]

[Tr√© Cool]
Geez! Ahh

I got a rock and roll band
I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
And another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house
I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums
And I can play the guitar
I got a kid in new york
I got a kid in the bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin'
In over 22 days
So get off my case
Off of my case
Off of my case

[Part 5: We're Coming Home Again]

[Billie Joe]
Here they come marching down the street
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
The time has come
And it's going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair, now
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat
The world is spinning around and around
Out of control again
From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb
And visit me in hell
We're the ones going

Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again

I started fuckin' running
Just as soon as my feet touched the ground
We're back in the barrio
But to you and me, that's jingle town

Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again

Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They're all out without you
Havin' fun
