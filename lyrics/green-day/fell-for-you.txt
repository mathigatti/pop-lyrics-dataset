I woke up in a pool of sweat
At first I thought that I pissed the bed
Heart of stars in the midnight hour
A kiss of death from the Effiel Tower


And I went down like the speed of sound
You're out of sight but not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you
I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while

I'll crash into you, crash into you
Did you crash in my imagination too?

Break a leg and you crushed my heart
I'm a mess and you're a work of art
Count your blessings going zero to five
Steal a kiss and I took a dive

And I went down like the speed of sound
You're out of sight but not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you
I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while

I'll crash into you, crash into you
Did you crash in my imagination too?

I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you
I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while

I'll crash into you, crash into you
Did you crash in my imagination...

I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you
And I fell for you
And I fell for you
