Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone
The worry rock has turned to dust and fallen on our pride


A knocked down dragged out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
And no one will take the fall

Where do we go from here?
And what did you do with directions?
Promise me no dead end streets
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road

A knocked down dragged out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
And no one will take the fall

Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud
Where do we go from here?
And what did you do with directions?
Promise me no dead end streets
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road
