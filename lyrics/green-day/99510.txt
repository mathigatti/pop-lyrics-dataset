Hey there lookin' at me
Tell me what do you see
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Don't have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit grey


Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time

What is it that drives me mad
Girls like you that I never had
What is it about you that I adore?
What makes me feel so much pain
That makes me go so insane
What is it about you that I adore?

Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time
What time? wooow!

Why did you have to leave so soon?
Why did you have to walk away?
Oh well it happened again
She walked away with her boyfriend
Maybe we'll meet again someday.
Maybe we'll meet again someday.
Maybe we'll meet again someday.
Someday!
