He's at it again
And he's gonna win
Gonna take it for a hell ride anyway
He's on your side
Gonna throw you aside


And let the vultures pick apart what's left
Seems like everything was
Just a fraction of a second from being okay
So run and hide 'cause we're all gonna die
And let the vultures pick apart what's left

I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
He's at it again
He's at it again

And it makes great television watching the world end
He's at it again
He's gonna win
Gonna take it for a joyride anyway
You're standing in line, better make up your mind

And let the bastard pick apart what's left of you
Seems like everything was
Just a fraction of being a dream
So run and hide 'cause we're all gonna die
Let the government decide what's left

I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
He's at it again
He's at it again

And it makes great television watching the world end
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back

Walk around I see
Million possibilities
Well I know
Nowhere to go
And I can't comprehend
Things this real seems so pretend
I know... I don't know
But I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back

And it makes great television watching the world end
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back

And it makes great television watching the world end
I'll be back
