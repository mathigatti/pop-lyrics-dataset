Where did you come
Where have you been
It looks like you fell into the trash bin


I'm catching a train
I'm crashing in the car
Packing for daylight
Shooting for the stars

Like a life long daisy chain
Of my imagination
A rat inside a maze
I've got no destination

Cause i'm a little boy named train
As we begin i'll tell you the same
Little boy named train

Don't know where i come from
But i know where i have been
Say!

Serious people are funny to me
Funny people seem so serious

I'm always lost and nothing will change
Give me directions and i'll get lost again

Like a life long daisy chain
Of my imagination
A rat inside a maze
I've got no destination

Cause i'm a little boy named train
As we begin i'll tell you the same
Little boy named train

Don't know where i come from
But i know where i have been
Say!

Like a life long daisy chain
Of my imagination
A rat inside a maze
I've got no destination

Cause i'm a little boy named train
As we begin i'll tell you the same
Little boy named train

Don't know where i come from
But i know where i have been
I said i don't know where i come from
But i know where i have been
