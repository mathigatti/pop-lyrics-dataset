My friend drove off the other day,
And now he's gone and all they say,
Is you gotta live cuz life goes on...


But now I see I'm mortal, too,
I can't live my life like you,
Gotta live it up, while life goes on.

And I think that it's all right,
That I do what I like,
Cuz that's the way I wanna live.
And so I give, and I'm still givin'...

And now I wonder 'bout my friend,
If he gave all he could give,
Cuz he lived his life like I live mine.

If you could see inside my head,
Then you'd start to understand,
The things I value in my heart.

And I think that it's all right,
That I do what I like,
Cuz that's the way I wanna live.
And so I give, and I'm still givin'...

You know that...
I know that...
You're watchin' me!

And I think that it's all right,
That I do what I like,
Cuz that's the way I wanna live.
And so I give, and I'm still givin'...

Gotta make a plan,
Gotta do what's right,
Can't run around in circles,
If you wanna build a life,
But I don't wanna make a plan,
For a day far away,
While I'm young and while I'm able,
All I wanna do is...
