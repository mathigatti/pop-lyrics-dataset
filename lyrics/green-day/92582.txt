What brings you around?
Did you lose something the last time you were here?


You'll never find it now
It's buried deep with your identity

So stand aside and let the next one pass
Don't let the door kick you in the ass

There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
Don't even try

Exit out the back
And never show your head around again

Purchase your ticket
And quickly take the last train
Out of town

An stand aside and let the next one pass
Don't let the door kick you in the ass

There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
Don't even try

There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
Don't even try
