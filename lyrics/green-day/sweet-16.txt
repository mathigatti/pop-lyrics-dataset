Bring me back
To an hour ago
Time stands still
As the years go by


Brown eyed girl
That's throwing down
A bottle of Old English
Back in the warehouse

Old days are fine
But are left so far behind
From California
To Jane Streets
The kids are alright
Alright as they'll ever be

Cause you will always be my,
Well you will always be my,
You will always be my sweet sixteen

Sleep on the floor
On cardboard
Stab out my heart
Like a dart board

Brown skinned girl
That I've dreamed about
A long long time now
From the Mid-West
To the beach

Old days are fine
But are left so far behind
From California
To Jane Streets
The kids are alright
Alright as they'll ever be

Cause you will always be my,
Well you will always be my,
You will always be my sweet sixteen

Old days are fine
But are left so far behind
From California
To Jane Streets
The kids are alright
Alright as they'll ever be

Cause you will always be my,
Well you will always be my,
You will always be my sweet sixteen
