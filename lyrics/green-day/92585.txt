Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days
They're getting over the hill
Death is closing in and catching up
As far as I can tell


Got a plan of action and cold blood
And it smells of defiance
I'll just wait for Mom and Dad to die
And get my inheritance

Well, now I want more
'Cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
But it's all figured out
Well, nothing good can last

Crows feet and rot are setting in
And time is running out
My parents' income interest rate
Is gaining higher clout
I'm a snot-nosed slob without a job
And I know I damn well should
Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days
But my future's looking good

Well, now I want more
'Cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
But it's all figured out
Well, nothing good can last

Well, now I want more
'Cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
But it's all figured out
Well, nothing good can last
