I've got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up


My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high
I lose control and I get myself all wound up

Tension mounts and I fly off the wall
I self-destruct and I get myself all wound up

Petulance and irritation set in
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up

Bother myself and I'm all wound up
Little reserve and I'm all wound up
Loss of control and I'm all wound up
All by myself and I'm all wound up

Chip on my shoulder and a leech on my back
Stuck in a rut and I get myself all wound up

Killed my composure and it will never come back
Loss of control and I get myself all wound up

Blown out of proportion again
My temper snaps and I get myself all wound up

Spontaneous combustion
Panic attack
I slipped a gear and I get myself all wound up

I lose myself and I'm all wound up
Bother myself and I'm all wound up
I like myself and I'm all wound up

I like myself and I'm all wound up

I've got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up

My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high
I lose control and I get myself all wound up

Tension mounts and I fly off the wall
I self-destruct and I get myself all wound up

Petulance and irritation set in
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up

Bother myself and I'm all wound up
Loss of control and I'm all wound up
Panic attack and I'm all wound up
Bother myself and I'm all wound up
