Turn out the lights
Close your eyes
Turn up the silence
The heartache of your life
Dance forever
Under the lights
This brutal love


Oh how you want it
You're begging for it
But you can't have it
Even if you try
It's in the clutches
In my hands of
This brutal love

Old toys
This plastic heart
Loners and fools
Are tearing me apart
Here comes trouble
The uninvited
This brutal love

Danger
Not quite at home
The eyes of temptation
The flesh on my bones
Hello stranger
I'm a disaster
This brutal love

Bad luck
Bitters and soda
Anguish and shame
The modern fool
Bad sex
Buy me a train wreck
Something for my troubled mind

Bad luck
Bitters and soda
Anguish and shame
The modern fool
Bad love
Kiss me I'm loaded
Something for my troubled mind

Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
This brutal love
