We starve-look 
At one another short of breath 
Walking proudly in our winter coats 
Wearing smells from laboratories 
Facing-a dying nation 
Of moving paper fantasy 
Listening for the new told lies 
With supreme visions of lonely tunes 


Somewhere 
Inside something there is a rush of 
Greatness 
Who knows what stands in front of 
Our lives 
I fashion my future on films in space 
Silence 
Tells me secretly 
Everything 
Everything 

Manchester England England 
Manchester England England 
[Eyes look your last] 

Across the Atlantic Sea 
[Arms take your last embrace] 

And I'm a genius genius 
[And lips oh you the doors of breath] 

I believe in God 
[Seal with a righteous kiss] 

And I believe that God believes in Claude 
[Seal with a righteous kiss] 

That's me, that's me, that's me 
[The rest is silence 
The rest is silence 
The rest is silence]

We starve-look 
At one another Short of breath 
Walking proudly in our winter coats 
Wearing smells from laboratories 
Facing a dying nation 
Of moving paper fantasy 
Listening for the new told lies 
With supreme visions of lonely tunes 

Singing 
Our space songs on a spider web sitar 
Life is around you and in you 
Answer for Timothy Leary, dearie 

Let the sunshine 
Let the sunshine in 
The sunshine in 
Let the sunshine â€¦
