People making lists 
Buying special gifts
It's a time to be kind 
To one and all
It's that time of year 
When good friends 
Are dear
And you wish you
Could give more
Than just presents 
From a store


Why don't you give love 
On Christmas day 
(On Christmas day)
Oh, even the man 
Who has everything
Would be so happy 
If you would bring
Him love 
On Christmas day 
(On Christmas day)
No greater gift 
Is there than love

People you don't know 
Smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air 
Of Christmas joy
It's that once a year 
When the world's sincere
And you'd like 
To find a way
To show the things 
That words can't say

Why don't you give love 
On Christmas day 
(On Christmas day)
The man on the street 
And the couple upstairs
All need to know 
That there's one cares
Give love 
On Christmas day 
(Christmas day)
No greater gift 
Is there than love
What the world 
Needs is love
Yes, the world 
Needs your love

Why don't you give love 
On Christmas day 
(On Christmas Day)
Oh, every little child 
On Santa's knee
Has room for your love 
Underneath his tree
Give love 
On Christmas day 
(Christmas day)
No greater gift 
Is there than love
What the world 
Needs is love
Yes, the world 
Needs your love

Give love 
On Christmas day 
(Christmas day)
