I was planned for kiss
But she was planned again
Now she's gone and left
And I don't know
If I'll ever be the same


(Oh I)
I wonder who she's seeing now
(Oh baby)
I wonder who she's holding now
(who she's holding now)
I wonder who she's seeing now
(Oh, oh, oh)
I wonder who she's folling

She doesn't know now
She's tearing me apart
Breaking my heart, yeah
Doesn't know what I'm going through
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
It's getting harder every single day
Without her

I wonder who she's seeing now
(Oh, I wish and I knew, girl)
I wonder who she's holding now
(Oh, baby)
I wonder who she's seeing now (Oh)
I wonder who she's folling

If I could find a way
To turn back to time
When she was still mine
Till the love of we melt away
(Remember a way)
I'd hold her in my arms again
And never let us slip away

I wonder
I wonder who she's seeing now
(Oh girl, everyday, oh)
I wonder who she's holding now
(So close tonight, girl)
I guess she's holding me in the heart
I wonder who she's folling

I wonder (I wonder)
Who she's seeing now
(Who she's seeing now)
I wonder (I wonder)
Who the girl's seeing back now
(Who she's seeing now)

Didn't know she'd be gone today
Now I've got to find my own way, yeah
Even though I need her more this day

I wonder
I Wonder who she's seeing now
I wonder who she's holdin home back now

I don't know
I wonder who she's seeing now, well
I wonder who she's fooling, baby

I wonder
I wonder who she's seeing now
(Let me love you like I do)
I wonder who she's holding now
(Oh, let me take care of you, baby)
I wonder who she's seeing now
(Who she's seeing now)...
