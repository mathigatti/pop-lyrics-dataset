Maybe you'd like to give me kisses sweet
Only for one night with no repeat
Maybe you'd go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all
Oh little girl


Chorus
In that case I don't want no part
Well that that would only break my heart
Well if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Well if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion

Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down
And you ain't got the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love will make us fools
And so it makes you wise to break the rules
Oh little girl

[chorus]

In that case I don't want no part
Well that that would only break my heart
Well if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
So if you fell like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
