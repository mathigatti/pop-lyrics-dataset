Morning... (Mor-or-ning)
Seems to come so slow.
Knowing... (Know-ow-ing)
How I need this warming glow.


Foolishly, I've made you cried.
Confident, you never say goodbye.

Darling, that's the reason why,
That even in a crowd, laughing out loud, I'm lonely. (Lonely)
For I love you only. And without you,
Every night's... just another lonely night.

Falling. (Just another)
Tears are falling from my eyes.
I'm calling (Just another)
Out your name, tearful sigh.

How I pray it's not too late.
All my life for you I wait.
Just call me I won't hesitate,
For when you left you took the best of me.

I love you, can't you see?
Since you've been gone,
Every night's... just another lonely night.

(Just another)
Since you've been gone my life is so lonely, baby, baby.
It's just-a (Just another)
Even my sun is hoping. (?)

(Just another)
Oh, it's all I need is you only.
Hmmm

(Just another)
I'm just no good without you, baby.
I'm just-a lonely, lonely...
