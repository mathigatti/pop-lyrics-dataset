I know you want to leave me.
But I refuse to let you go.
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me.


Ain't too proud to beg, and you know it.
Please don't leave me girl. (Don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead baby, baby.
Please don't leave me girl. (Don't you go)

Now I heard a crying man,
Is half a man with no sense of pride.
But if I have to cry to keep you,
I don't mind weepin' if it will keep you by my side.

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darling.
Ooo, don't leave me girl. (Don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead baby, baby.
Please don't leave me girl. (Don't you go)

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day.
Just to keep you from walking away.
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand.
'Cause I want to keep you anyway I can.

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darling.
Ooo, don't leave me girl. (Don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead baby, baby.
Please don't leave me girl. (Don't you go)

Woo, alright.

[Instrumental]

Now I got a love so deep in the pit of my heart.
And each day it grows more and more.
I'm not a shame to come and plead to you baby.
If pleading keeps you from walking out that door.

Ain't too proud to beg, and you know it.
Ooo, Don't leave me girl. (Don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead baby, baby.
Ooo, don't leave me girl. (Don't you go)
Baby, baby, baby... baby, baby
Ooo, don't leave me girl.
