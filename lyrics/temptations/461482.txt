You surely must know, magic girl
'Cause you changed my life
It was dull and ordinary
You made it sunny and bright
Now


I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good, girl
And you're all that matters to me

When my way was dark
And troubles were near
You're love provided the light
So I could see girl
Just knowing you're love was near
When times were bad
Kept the world from closing in on me
Girl

I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good girl
And you're all that matters to me

Baby, you're part of every
Thought I think each day
Your name is in every
Phrase my lips say
Every dream I dream is about you
Honey I couldn't live without you

Baby (baby), baby (baby), baby

You're my everything, you're my everything
(Yes, you are, you're my everything)

You're the girl I sing about
In every love song I sing (you're my everything)
You're my winter baby
My summer, my fall and spring (my everything)

I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good girl
And you're all that matters to me

You're my everything (when my way was dark)
You're my everything (and troubles were near)
Don't you know, baby, you're my everything?
(You're my everything)
