Hello, young lovers whoever you are.
I hope your troubles are few.
All my good wishes go with you tonight.
I've been in love like you.
Be brave. (Be brave)
Young lovers, why don't you come home,
Follow your sorrow. (Oh, yeah)
Be brave and faithful and true. (Be brave and faithful and true)
Be very close to each other tonight. (Whoa, yeah)
I've been in love like you.
[Instrumental]
I know how it feels to have wings on your heels.
And to fly, and to fly, and to fly down the street in a trance.
David: In a trance, in a trance, in a trance.
Fly down the street on a chance that you'll meet.
And you'll meet, not ready by chance. (?)
Don't cry, young lovers, whatever you do.
Don't cry because I'm alone.
David: Don't cry because I'm all alone, now.
All of my memories are happy tonight.
I had a love of my own.
I had a love of my own, like yours.
I had a love of my own.
Hello, young lovers, whatever you do.
Don't cry because I'm alone.
David: Don't cry because I'm all alone, now.
All of my memories are happy tonight.
I had a love of my own.
I had a love of my own, like yours.
I had a love of my own, like yours.
I had a love of my own, like yours.
I had a love of my own.
Eddie: Hello young lovers whoever you are.
Paul: Hello young lovers whoever you are.
Otis: Hello young lovers whoever you are.
David: Hello young lovers whoever you are.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
