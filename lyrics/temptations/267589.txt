Check Yourself 
&gt;&gt; The Temptations 
 
    By and by, you knew that you make me cry. (By and by, knew you'd make me cry) 
And my love for you will never die. (My love will never, never die) 
But I had to find out on my own. 


(Check yourself, check yourself) 

Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself) 
I paid no mind. (Check yourself, check yourself) 
I kept on breaking hearts, (Check yourself, check yourself) 
All down the line. (Check yourself, check yourself) 

Sometimes you just got to lose. 
That's when you pay your dues. 
I guess I was a fool, I guess I was a fool, 
To think that... you'd stayed so true. 

Aww, I really played in the game. (Check yourself, check yourself) 
I'd always win. (Check yourself, check yourself) 
Now the tables turn. (Check yourself, check yourself) 
And I'm on the losing end. (Check yourself, check yourself) 

Oh don't, feel sorry. 
I had it coming, it's true. 
'Cause I'm losing, yes, I'm losing, I'm losing you. 

Before I go, I'd like for you to know. 
You've had my heart from the very start. 
But there's one more thing, before we part. 
And that's I'm sorry, sorry, sorry to my heart. 

Aww, I'm on my sad way. (Check yourself, check yourself) 
Because I know I'd lost your love. (Check yourself, check yourself) 
I'll kick it, like a pass. (Check yourself, check yourself) 

But I'll be thinking of.... 
The good times. (The good times) 
The bad times. (The bad times) 
But good or bad, happy or sad, 
Of memories. (Memories) 
Sweet, sweet memories. (Memories) 
Aww, memories... are all I have. 

Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself) 
That's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself) 
That's what they... what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself) 
Hmmm...
