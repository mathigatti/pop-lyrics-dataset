Sittin' here in this chair waitin' on you
Ah, baby, to see things my way
But not a word do you say
You won't even look my way
Girl, I'm spending my dimes, wasting my time
Talking 'til I'm black and blue
Ah, can't you see
I wanna get next to you
Dreams of you and I go sailing by
Whenever your eyes meet mine
(spoken)You're so fine
And girl you make me feel so insecure
You're so beautiful and pure
Why must you be so unkind
(spoken)and tell me I'm not your kind, blowin' my mind
Girl my money is low and I know
That I can't take you to the fancy places you might wanna go
Still I wanna get next to you
Ah I wanna get next to you
Girl you can bend me, shake me, make me
Whatever it takes to please you I'm willing to do
'Cause you're my dream come true
I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you
I wanna make you mine for all time
I wanna get next to you
I promise I'll never make you blue
I wanna get next to you 
I wanna get next to you
