Say, you
Who do you belong to?
Say, you
I've been hoping to meet you


Baby (Baby)
You've caught my eye
I can't deny
I realize it's you
I like what I see
You're perfect for me
Fast and fancy

Say, you
Who do you love? (Say, you)

I don't want to be friends if my heart kept seein' 
Watching you play around (You play around)
This would make me sad
Hurt so bad
Drag my spirit down

Girl...Say, you
Who do you love? (Say, you)
(Baby) Give me the key to your heart.
Baby, say you
Who do you belong to? 
(Give me the key to your heart)
Baby, baby, you, Lil' Girl 
(Give me the key to your heart)
Baby, you.
