You say you won't give me the time-of-day,
You refuse my conversation, won't even look my way,
But I know I'm gonna get you, ooh it's just a matter of time,
Girl, I'm not gonna give up trying until you are mine,


Beware!, You better beware, You better beware (I'm out to get you),
Beware!, You better beware, You better beware,

Listen honey,

I am so determined (I am so determined),
To win your love for me,
Girl there's no substitution,
No, No, I just won't let you be,

Listen honey, Every time I see you,
Ooh, I feel so doggone good inside,
I just can't hold back my feelings,
Listen honey, I just won't be denied,

Beware!, You better be, You better beware, I gonna get you (I'm out to get you),
Beware!, You better beware, You better beware,

(Glenn)
You better beware, (I'm out to get you girl)
You better beware,

You got to beware, You got to beware, (Got to beware)
You got to beware, You got to beware, (You better beware)
You got to beware, You got to beware, (You better beware)
You got to beware, You got to beware, (Let me in, let me in because)

You and I together,
Ooh, we swing in perfect harmony,
It would make my life so much better,
Woo woo, Woo woo, How sweet it would be baby,

You know how much I love you,
(You know how much I love you)
Woo, Woo, Woo, Woo, You still wanna run away baby,
But girl I'm gonna get you,
You better believe me when I say,

Beware!, You better be, Oh, You better beware, I gonna get you (I'm out to get you),

To refuse my conversation,

I wanna be your man, beware!,

Oh, You better beware

To refuse my conversation,
