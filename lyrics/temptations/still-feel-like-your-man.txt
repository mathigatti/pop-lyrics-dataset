Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your
I still feel like your man (man)


The prettiest girl in the room she wants me
I know because she told me so (told me so)
She says come over
I'd like to get to know you
But I just don't think I can (just don't think I can)

'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man

Oh, baby, yeah

I still keep your shampoo in my shower (shower)
In case you wanna wash your hair
And I know that you probably found yourself some more somewhere
But I do not really care
'Cause as long as it is there

I still feel like your man (still feel like your man)
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man

Your man, your man

Still like the letters in your name and how they feel
Still like to leave the party early and go home, babe
And don't you know, babe
I'd rather sit here on my own and be alone, babe

Still feel like your man (still feel like your man)
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man (still feel like your man)
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man

I got your picture
In my minds but still wonder
I'm still thinking about you, baby
I still feel like your man

Still feel like your
Still feel like your
Still feel like your
Still feel like your
