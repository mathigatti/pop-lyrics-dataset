You know, every house has a door and every room has a floor.
Every fence has a gate and every beast has a mate.
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.
I ain't got nothing.


Every stove has a fire and every car has a tire.
Every fish has a bowl and every shoe has a sole.
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.
I ain't got nothing.

Now I don't care about politics and things across the sea.
All I want all I want to do is love 
And have somebody love me. I need I need somebody.

Every lion has a den and every little pig has its pen.
Every road has a way and (they tell me) every dog has its day.
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.
I ain't got nothing I ain't got nothing. Oh no.
(repeat to fade)
