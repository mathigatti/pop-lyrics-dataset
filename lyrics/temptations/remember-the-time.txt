Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time when we first met
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time


Do you remember when we fell in love
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began
It just seemed like heaven
So why did it end?

Do you remember back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare

Tell me

Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time when we first met, girl
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember how we used to talk
We would stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said
Like I love you so I'll never let you go

Do you remember back in the spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember those special times
They'll just go on and on in the back of my mind

Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories will always be dear to me
And, girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now, baby

Do you remember the time
(Do you remember)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember the time
(Do you remember)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time
