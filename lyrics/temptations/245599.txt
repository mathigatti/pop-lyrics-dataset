Whose hairstyles are out of this world?
Where love is straight or i find up it's curled?
My baby, my baby, my baby
Baby, baby, pretty baby
Hair soft like a baby lamb
&amp; i love to run my fingers through it
I hope she digs me the way i am
But if i have to change, you know
I'm gonna do it for my baby
(i'm gonna do it for my baby)


Ooo personality contains more gold
Than any bank in this world could hold
My baby, my baby, my baby
Baby, baby, pretty baby
The gold in her personality
Would send other guys to shame
This golden girl belongs to me
Let no guy try to stake his claim for my baby
(stake his claim for my baby)

My baby, she's cute as can be
My baby, girl's got a hold on me
My baby has a kiss so sweet
It knocks me off my feet
She makes my life complete
Oh yeah, she's my baby
Oh yeah, she's my baby
I love her so, yeah (i love my baby so)

My baby, she's cute as can be
My baby, girl's got a hold on me
My baby has a kiss so sweet
It knocks me off my feet
She makes my life complete

Who has my mind in a kind of a haze?
Who has a rock around a rose?
My baby, my baby, my baby
Baby, baby, pretty baby
Gives me a feeling i can't explain
She sets my soul on fire
I don't feel hurt &amp; i don't feel pain
All i feel is a strong desire for my baby
(strong desire for my baby)

Oh yeah, my baby
That personality, it satisfies me
Oh yeah, that's my baby
My baby, my baby
My baby, my baby
