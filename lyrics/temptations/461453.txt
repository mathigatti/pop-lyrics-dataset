Sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings
And there's nothing that I can do
Can't help myself
No, I cant help myself
Sugar pie, honey bunch
I'm weaker than a man should be
I cant help myself
I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I dont love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried
But ev'ry time I see your face
I get all choked up inside
When I call your name
Girl, it starts the flame
Burning in my heart
Tearing it all apart
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide
'Cause sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I'm weak for you
Can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
Sugar pie, honey bunch
Do anything you ask me to
Can't help myself
I want you and nobody else
