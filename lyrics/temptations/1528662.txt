Listen, baby:

If I don't love you this way (hey)
why do I say what I say? (hey)
If I don't need you this much (baby)
Why do I ache for your touch? (much)


With you it seems
I can reach the stars
With reckless
hopes and dreams

But you it seems
Still don't believe
How valuble you are

I really loving you baby
I'm not pretending to

If I don't love you this strong
Why do I beg to belong
How can you doubt that I care (baby)
When I'm with you everywhere, yeah

With you I find
I can close my eyes
To the world surrounding me
And you create
The sweetest things
That I could ever be

I really really really loving you baby
I'm not pretending to (he-e-ey)

If I don't love you this way (hey)
Why do I say what I say?
If I don't need you this much (baby)
Why do I ache for your touch?

You just have to smile
To make my life worth while
Doesn't that explain
That I'm playin' no games

If I don't love you this way (hey!)
Why do I say what I say? (hey!)
If I don't need you this much (baby)
Why do I ache for your touch?

If I don't love you this strong
Why do I beg to belong
How can you doubt that I care (baby)
When I'm with you everywhere, yeah
