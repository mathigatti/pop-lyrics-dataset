You asked me to forget about you.
Go out and find someone knew.
That won't be easy you see.
After all the things you've done for me.
Though I'm a man, I ain't too proud to say.
With you I stand tall and strong.
Without you girl, I'm nothing at all.
Like a snowman in the sun, my life was wasting away.
Your love gave me hope and strength, you're the reason I'm alive today.
How, I wanna know.
How can I forget ya, woman
After all you've done for me.
You'll always be apart of me.
Girl, you don't realize what your love means to me.
It's more precious than the air I breathe.
I wanna know, how...
How can I forget ya, woman
After all you've done for me.
Girl, you'll always be apart of me.
How, I wanna know.
How can I forget ya, woman
After all you've done for me.
You'll always be apart of me.
How, how, how... how can I forget ya, woman
You've been so good, good baby.
How can I forget ya
It's impossible to do.
How can I forget ya, woman.
You've been so good, good, good to me.
How can I forget ya
I want to know.
Ha-ha-ha... how can I forget ya
