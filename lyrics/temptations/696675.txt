(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

To get stones from a rock, you've got to break it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
To get bread from dough, you've got to bake it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)


To get water from a faucet, you've got to turn it
And if you want my love, if you want my love
You've got to earn it (Earn it, earn it, earn it)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

To get fire from a match, you've got to strike it
(Strike it, strike it, strike it, strike it)
To get the feeling from a kiss, you've got to like it
(Like it, like it, like it, like it)

To get ashes from wood, you've got to burn it
And if you want my love, if you want my love
You've got to earn it(Earn it, earn it, earn it)

You've got to treat me kind, all the time
Throw the other guys right out of your mind.
(Yeah,yeah)

(Instrumental)

Now listen

To make broken things work, you've got to fix them
(Fix them, fix them, fix them, fix them)
To make two things one, you've got to mix them
(Mix them, mix them, mix them, mix them)

To get butter from milk, you've got to churn it
And if you want my love, if you want my love
You've got to earn it(Earn it, earn it, earn it)

If you deserve it you can get it
I'll be glad to see you with it
Just show me that you love me
And that you're thinking of me
You can get it in a hurry...
