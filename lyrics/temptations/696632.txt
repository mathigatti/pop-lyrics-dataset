Lady luck and 4 leaf clover
won't ease this hurt I feel all over
my life was one special occasion
till your leavin' dampened the situation


whoa oh oh standin on shakey ground
ever since you put me down
I'm standin on shakey ground
ever since you put me down

my car got repossesed this mornin'
harder times I haven't seen in years, years
whoa ya better throw me a life preserver
cause I'm about to drown in my own tears

whoa oh oh standin on shakey ground
ever since you put me down
I'm standin on shakey ground
ever since you put me down
