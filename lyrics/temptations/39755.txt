Melvin: Yes, my skin is black
But that's no reason to hold me back
Eddie: Why don't you think about it
Think about it, think about it, think about it
Think about it
I have wants and desires
Just like you
So move on the side
'Cause I'm comin' through, oh!


Temptations: No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now
Eddie and Temptations: No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now, oooh

Melvin: Yes, your skin is white
Does that make you right?
Eddie: Why don't you think about it
Think about it, think about it, think about it
Think about it
This is a message
A message to y'all
Together we stand
Divided we fall, oh!

Dennis: Black is a color
Just like white
Tell me how can a color determine whether
You're wrong or right
We all have our faults
Yes we do

Eddie: So look in your mirror
Temptations: Look in the mirror
Eddie: What do you see?
Temptations: What do you see?
Eddie: Two eyes
Temptations: Two eyes
Eddie: A nose, and a mouth just like me, oh!

Eddie: Your eyes are open
But you refuse to see
The laws of society
Were made for both you and me
Because of my color
I struggle to be free
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But in the end
You're gonna' see my friend, oh!

Temptations: No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now
(Chorus repeated several times through music, or "the bridge" )

(After a few minutes, above chorus is repeated
As song nears end, and then)

Temptations: Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

Temptations: Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

Temptations: Say it!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

Temptations: Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

Temptations: Say it loud!
Dennis: I'm black and I'm proud!
Temptations: No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

Temptations: Say it loud!
Dennis: I'm black and I'm proud!
Temptations: No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

Fade to end
