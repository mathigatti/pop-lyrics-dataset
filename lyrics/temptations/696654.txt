That's life, that's what people say.
You're riding' high in April, Shot down in May. But I know I'm gonna change that tune, When I'm back on top in June. That's life, funny as it seems. Some people get their kicks, Steppin' on dreams; But I don't let it get me down, 'Cause this ol' word keeps getting around. 
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, 
A poet, a pawn and a king. I've been up and down and over and out And I know one thing: Each time 
I find myself flat on my face, I pick myself up and get back in the race. That's life, I can't deny it, I thought of quitting, But my heart just won't buy it. If I didn't think it was worth a try, I'd roll myself up in a big ball and die.
