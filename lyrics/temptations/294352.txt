Eddie:
Girl, as you walk by... I breathe a sigh.
And deep inside I knew it had to be.
This little girl is mine.
And for a little while I heard a strange rhapsody.
Hmmm
So lovely and so fair. (Fair)
I knew right then and there. (There)
That you were made for me.
And it wasn't hard to see.
I guess I was born to love you. (Born to love you)
Born to love you. (Born to love you)
Hmmm (Born to love you)
(Honey I, I was born to love you. Give my love to no one but you.)
David:
Here stands a man, with his future in your hands.
Don't let go. (Don't let go)
Don't let go. (Don't let go)
Baby, don't let her go. (Don't let go)
Please (Don't let go)
Eddie:
You better come on and take my hand.
'Cause I don't understand, this crazy feeling in my soul.
But I know that I would rather die, then let this feeling go.
Now girl can't you see (See)
That this was meant to be. (Be)
It's funny but it's true.
I guess I was just born to love you. (Born to love you)
David:
Darling... (Born to love you)
Darling I... (Born to love you)
I was born... (Born to love you)
Born to love only you. (Born to love you)
Why don't you believe... (Born to love you)
Believe what I tell you, baby (Born to love you)
I was born to love only you. (Born to love you)
(Born to love you)
Eddie:
Darling... (Born to love you)
I... (Born to love you)
Oh, our love is true. (Born to love you)
