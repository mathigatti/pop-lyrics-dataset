Now I'm a guy who's fond of sweet things, sweet things I adore,
In coffee most take one or two lumps, but I use three or four.
But since I kissed your sweet, sweet lips, sugar ain't sweet no more,
Your kiss was sweeter than any cup of coffee, I ever made before!


You know you're Little Miss Sweetness, ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world.

If ever a man had a sweet tooth, I have one indeed!
I order cookies and cakes, malts and shakes from the menus that I read!
But all the cakes and shakes and malts I've bought, put together don't exceed,
The sweetness in just one of your kisses, Baby you're the one I need!

You know you're Little Miss Sweetness, ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world.

Now listen to me you sweet things, hear what I have to say.
If ever you need somebody, send for me without delay!
But do one thing for me, don't go out on a rainy day,
Cause if it's true that rain melts sugar, you will surely melt away!

You know you're Little Miss Sweetness, ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world. Trying to tell you, you're Little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world.
The sweetest girl in the world.
