Who can I turn to
When nobody needs me
My heart wants to know
So I must go 
Where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me 
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way
And after the day
The darkness will hide me
But maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter
'Cause with you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away
With you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away
