That day, I first saw you passing by
I wanted, to ask your name but I...was much too shy
But I was looking at you so hard
That you must have had a hunch.
So you came up to me and asked me my name.
You beat me to the punch
That time
You beat me to the punch
Yes you did.
After, I had known you for what seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you would you please, please be mine
Whenever you came around, my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch.
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours.
You beat me to the punch
One more time
You beat me to the punch
Yes you did.
Since I loved you
I thought you would be true
And love me tender
So I let my heart surrender
To you, yes I did.
But I found out
Beyond a doubt
One day, boy
You were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me
Blue.
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day.
And beat you to the punch
Yes I will
I'll beat you to the punch
This time.
