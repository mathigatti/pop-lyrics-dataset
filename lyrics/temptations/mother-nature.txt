Mother Nature
Go on and take your course
And a-take me with you
Hey, I wanna leave here
Mother Nature, take the chains off me
As long as I'm livin', livin'
Hey, I wanna be free
Come on and let your sweet wine
Rush to my head
And make me feel fine
Let me stand naked in the sun
Hiding from no one
Mother Nature
Come on and do your thing
I want to start to felling
All those good things you can bring
Day in, day out, I learn to find
Leaves me half alive
And I'm going to nowhere
I can't live in this classic world
It's killing me
Can't you see?
