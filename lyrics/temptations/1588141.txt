Seems like it was only yesterday
When my Momma told me
don't fall in love
with the first girl that comes your way


She was fine fine fine but  passed  by
Years have passed
don't look like loves
gonna give me a second try

The look on your face
tells me you understand
Could it be your love life,
like mine needs a helping hand

You need love like I do, don't you?
Girl, I can tell by the way you look,
when I'm looking at you?

I know it aint fit and proper
for a girl to talk this way
But I can't cope with this loneliness,
not one more dog-gone day

Every day has been an uphill climb
to keeping my hopes afloat
Judging by your silence girl,
you must be in the same boat

any true now!

You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look,
when I'm looking at you (giiirl)
You need love like I do, don't you? (oh yeah)
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror,
when I'm looking at you

I can't begin to tell
how many night times have been all lonely,
Come on tell me girl
does it ever happen to you?

I'm gonna tell you something
and believe me it aint no joke,
My love life
is just like a sinking boat

I can understand
a person being without money
But surely there
isn't a reason for a person to be without love.

Listen to me now!

You're a girl and I I'm a guy
So, come on lets give love a try

Any true, now
You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look,
when I'm looking at you

Girl, find true love is a dream (dream)
that everyone wants to come true (true)
Can't you see its up to us
to make this dream come true

Oh! You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look,
when I'm looking at you (oh yeah)
You need love like I do, don't you?
Well It seems like I'm looking
in the mirror, when I'm looking at you

Girl, I say

You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look,
when I'm looking at you
You need love like I do, don't you?
it seems like I'm looking
in the mirror, when I'm looking at you

Giiirl, You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look,
when I'm looking at you

You need love like I do, don't you?
Aint it true, Aint it true, Aint it true?

You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look,
when I'm looking at you
You need love like I do, don't you (...)
