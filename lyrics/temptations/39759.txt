I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talking about my girl (my girl)


I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees

Well I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talking about my girl (my girl)

Ooh, ooh

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Ooh yeah

I don't need no money fortune or fame
I've got all the riches baby
One man can claim

Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talking about my girl (my girl)

Talking about my girl
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of may
With my girl
