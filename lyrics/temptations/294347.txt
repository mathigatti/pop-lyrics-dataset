Like a long lonely stream I keep runnin' towardas a dream 
Movin' on, movin' on
Like a branch on a tree I keep reachin' to be free 
Movin' on, movin' on.
'Cause there's a place in the sun 
Where there's hope for ev'ryone 
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run. 
There's a place in the sun 
And before my life is done 
Got to find me a place in the sun. 
Like an old dusty road I get weary from the load. 
Movin' on, movin' on 
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rollin' since my birth 
Movin' on, movin' on 
'Cause there's a place in the sun 
Where there's hope for ev'ryone 
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run. 
There's a place in the sun 
And before my life is done 
Got to find me a place in the sun.
