Once a wiseman said to me. This advice I give you free. A woman is made of fantasy so fan the flame. 
Always keep her hopes up high. 
Make her laugh don't make her cry and don't let her love die, so fan the flame.


A woman needs love and affection and little things mean alot (little things mean alot). 
And when she has an emotional baby. 
That's why you got to fan the flame to keep it burning hot.

Make her feel she ten feet tall, even though she short and small. 
so fan the falme. 
Her love is your reality let her go and you will see just how lonely life can be. So fan the falme.

A woman needs love and praising so give her them each day. 
Tell her you love her, its added protection. 
That's why you got to fan the falme to keep it burning hot.

Once a wiseman said to me. This advice I give you free. A woman is made of fantsy so fan the flame.
