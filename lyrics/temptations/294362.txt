Melvin:
Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom (Ect.)
Farewell, my love.
Farewell, my love.
I love you more than anything.
No one knows the good you bring....
Eddie: to me.
Paul:
But I've got to set you free. (Boo-oo)
I've just got to set you free. (Boo-oo)
Eddie:
Aww, goodbye, (goodbye) my love. (My love)
I'm gonna cry, (gonna cry) my love. (My love)
The vow of love you broken.
The law of love has spoken....
Eddie: to you.
Paul:
Oh, why couldn't you be true? (Why couldn't you be true?)
Why couldn't you be true? (Why couldn't you be true?)
Paul:
So long, baby. You know, it's so hard...
It's really hard to find someone in this wide world, who's really true.
I guess it's just meant for me to be unhappy.
But I believe, I really do believe that somewhere someone is waiting for me.
Eddie:
Aww, she's there, (she's there) my love. (My love)
Somewhere, (somewhere) my love. (My love)
Someone who cares.
And still be there...
Eddie: with me.
Paul:
Oh, my darling can't you see? (Boo-oo)
How wonderful it would be, yeah. (Boo-oo)
Farewell, to you.
Farewell, my love.
Eddie: We're...
Through.
Eddie: We're through.
