They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
But when you're walking down the street 
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere (on Broadway)


They say the women treat you right on Broadway
But looking at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how you gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes (on Broadway)

They say that I won't last too long on Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say 
But They're dead wrong, I know they are 
'Cause I can play this here guitar 
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (on Broadway)
