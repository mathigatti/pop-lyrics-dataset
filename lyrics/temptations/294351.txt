(Forgive this fool, my darling.)
Oh, this heart of mine, carries a heavy load.
When I think about how I've hurt you so.
After you've been, been so good to me.
I've been unfaithful, darling, I've caused you misery.
The feeling of guilt, oh, it tortures me.
And only you, my darling, oh, can set me free.
And darling, all, all I need
Is just to hear you say,
You'll forgive me, forgive me baby.
All, all I need, to have you touch my hand,
Say you'll understand, baby.
A moment of weakness, darling, caused me to stray.
Your trust in me, dear, I threw away.
When I look, look into your eyes.
I can see the hurt, baby, that you feel inside.
Although I hurt you baby, you never once complained.
It makes me feel, sweet darling, that much more ashamed.
Tears of guilt, tears of guilt running down my face.
Tears that only you baby, only you can erase.
And darling, all, all I need
Is just to hear you say,
You'll forgive me, forgive me baby.
All, all I need, to have you touch my hand,
Say you'll understand, ooo.
[Instrumental]
(Forgive this fool, my darling.)
I know, I made a big mistake.
When all your love, darling, yes I did forsake.
It's on my mind, it's in my heart.
This guilty feeling tearing me apart.
With every step I make, every breath I take.
I'll make it up to you, I'll make it up to you.
Undo the wrong I've done, undo the wrong I've done.
I've been unfaithful, I know it's true.
But I'll make it up to you.
Baby, all, all I need
Is just to hear you say,
You'll forgive me, forgive me baby.
All, all I need
To have you touch my hand,
Say you'll understand.
Baby, all, all I need
Is just to hear you say,
You'll forgive me, forgive me baby.
