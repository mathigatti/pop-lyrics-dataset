Do Do Do Do Do Do - Hey


When my Dad thought I had become of age
He said, "Son, you're getting to the Lovin' Stage"

I said, "Oh yeah, oh yeah"

"It's time you stopped being all alone
You've got to find a girl you can call your own"

I said, "Not now, I'll tell you later
Not now, I'll tell you when
Not now, I'll tell you later
When I'm gonna fall in love"

Do Do Do Do
Do Do Do Do Do
Do Do Do Do Do Do - Yeah

I met a little girl - fine as could be 
I said, "Girl, you're the girl that was made for me"

She said, "Oh yeah, oh yeah"

I thought if I tried, I just couldn't miss
So I asked the lil' girl for just one lil' kiss 

She said, "Not now, I'll tell you later (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you when (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you later
When I'm gonna fall in love"

When it's time for you to fall in love
It won't make sense for you to hurry
Take you time and make up your mind
Cause the surer you are, the less you have to work 

Do Do Do Do
Do Do Do Do Do
Do Do Do Do Do Do - Hey

Not now, I'll tell you later (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you when (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you later 
(Everybody) 
When I'm gonna fall in love
