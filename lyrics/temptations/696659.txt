This little girl of mine
I wanna say that she's so fine
And each and every day
I make sure she has her way
Now we dont feel tied down
Although our hearts are bound
I dont have to chase her all over town
My baby she's always around


Chorus: the girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright
(repeat)

Now she's so good to me
I guess that's why i feel fancy free
Just to see the glow in her eyes
Makes me once again realize
I love her with all of my heart
And i know we'll never ever part
I never heard about or caught her playin
I guess that's why you always hear me sayin

Chorus 2x

When i visit at her home
Other fellas never, never ring her phone
She let's them know just where they stand
She tells them all that i'm her man
And when we're out on a date
All the fellas wait till i walk away
They try to beat my time
She tells them in a nice way she's mine, all mine

Chorus (fade out)
