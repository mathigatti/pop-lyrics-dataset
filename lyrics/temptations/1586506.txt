Hey mister, hey mister, I just want a dime
'Cause I need a cup of coffee
And a moment of your time
I can see you're raisin' hell the way I used to do


But I wish someone
had'a talked to me
Like I wanna talk to you

Listen...

I've been to Georgia, California
Any place I could run
Stole a woman in Tennessee
And we made love in the sun

But I ran out of places with friendly faces
Because I had to be free
I've been to paradise,
but I've never been to me

Thank you mister, thank you kindly
Please don't walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today

I can see so much of me
Still livin' in your eyes
Won't you share a part of an old man's heart
Just the once before he dies

I've been to China and Asia Minor
On any ship that could sail
Made some noise with some good old boys
And we wrecked the county jail

I've seen the best men crawl
and some teardrops fall
There ain't nothing I didn't see

I've been to paradise,
but I've never been to me

(Orchestral Break)

I've even been to marriage
Had children cryin'
for someone they couldn't find
Never knowin' that I was searchin'
For things I left behind

I thought my heart could wait
But I learned too late
Only love can make people free

I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

I've been to paradise...I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

I've been to Georgia, California (oh yeah)
Any place I could run (can't you see?)
Stole a woman in Tennessee
And we made love in the sun

But I ran out of places with friendly faces
Because I had to be free
I've been to paradise,
but I've never been to me
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me
