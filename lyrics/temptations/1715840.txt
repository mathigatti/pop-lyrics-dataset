Oh-la-hoo


Don't change your style now that you've reached the top.
Don't choose your friends by what they've got.
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam.
Like everyday people you're just a human being.

(Superstar) Good God.
Enjoy your champagne (and caviar)
And your chauffeur drivin' (fancy car)
But remember how you got (where you are)
Oh-ho-ho, 'cause the same folks that made you, you better believe they can break you.

Oh-hoo-hoo
No you didn't make it all by yourself.
You had help from somebody else.
The truth is the light, don't let it depress you.
You just be thankful that the good Lord made you.

(Superstar) Ah
Do you know who your (real friends are?)
Ah, talkin' to you (superstar.)
Remember how you got (where you are.)

Ah-ha. Down, down, down, down
Drummer keep it going. (Going)
Horns star blowin'.
Right on time.
Blow my mind.

Higher (Higher)
Higher, higher

It's easy for you to look down.
Turn up your nose and frown.
Now that you're on top (Top)
(Bright lights) Don't let the bright lights blind you.
(Bridges) don't burn 'em behind you.

(Superstar) Good God.
Do you know who your (real friends are?)
Ah, talkin' to you (superstar.)
Remember how you got (where you are.)

Hmm, don't change your style, now that you've reached the top.
Don't choose your friends by what they've got.
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam.
Like everyday people you're just a human being.

(Superstar) Good God.
Do you know who your (real friends are?)
Ah, talkin' to you (superstar.)
Remember how you got (where you are.
