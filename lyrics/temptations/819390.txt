Earth angel, earth angel 
Will you be mine? 
My darling dear, love you all the time 
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you 


Earth angel, earth angel 
The one I adore 
Love you forever, and ever more 
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you 

I fell for you and I knew 
The vision of your love, loveliness 
I hope and I pray that someday 
I'll be the vision of your happy, happiness 

Oh earth, earth angel, earth angel 
Please be mine 
My darling dear, love you all the time 
I'm just a fool, fool, a fool in love with you 

I fell for you and I knew 
The vision of your loveliness 
I hope and pray 
I'll be the vision of your happiness 

Earth angel, earth angel 
Please be mine 
My darling dear love you all the time 
I'm just a fool, fool, a fool in love with you
