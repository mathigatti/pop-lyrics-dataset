Where I was born, ev'rything was dull and dingy
I lived in a place they called The Inner City
Getting ahead was strictly a no no
'Cause nobody cares what happens to the folks
That live in the ghetto
Thousands of lives wasting away
People living from day to day
It's a challenge just staying alive
'Cause in the ghetto only the strong survive


Money I ain't got none, job can't find one
The streets raised me from a baby, ooh
Thousands of lives wasting away
People living from day to day
It's a challenge just staying alive
'Cause in the ghetto only the strong survive

Broken down homes, kids strung out
They don't even know what life's all about
Stealin' cars, robbin' bars
Mugging, drugs, rat infested
And no one's interested

Kids dodging cars for recreation
Only adds to a mother's frustration
Break-ins, folks comin' home
And finding all their possessions gone
Oh it's an ev'ry day thing - well well - in the ghetto
Oh it's an ev'ry day thing in the ghetto
