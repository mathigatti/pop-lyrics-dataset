Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
People let me tell you about a place I know
To get in it don't take much dough
Where you can really do your thing, oh yeah
It's got a neon sign outside that says
Come in and take a look at your mind
You'd be surprised what you might find, yeah
Strobe lights flashin' way till after sundown
People gather there from all parts of town
Oh yeah, what do I call it
You know it's just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack


Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at, oh yeah
You can have your fortune told
You can learn the meaning of soul
There ain't no such thing as time
Incense in the air
'In" signs painted everywhere
I guarantee you this place will blow your mind
Music so high, you can't get over it
So love you can't get under it
Right around the corner just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack

Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Millionaires, kings and queens go there to do their things
You might see anybody there, yeah
Bear skin rugs, tails and beads
Don't really matter what you wear
You can take off your shoes, sit on the floor
Join in and be what you wanna be
Don't you know that it's right
Around the corner just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack

Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
They got a cat there shouting the blues
Talking about payin some dues
People walking around reciting poetry
Screamin guitars and a thousand colored lights
People I'm telling you this place is really out of sight
You can have your fortune told
You can learn the meaning of soul
I guarantee this place will blow your mind
Don't you know it's right around the corner
Just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack
