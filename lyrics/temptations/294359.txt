Don't send me away. (Don't send me away)
I've hurt you it's true.
Don't close the door. (Don't close the door)
I'll make it up to you.
'Cause you know that I (need your) your wonderful love.
Whoa
Don't send me away. (Don't send me away)
I may have been wrong.
But please let me stay. (Please let me stay)
Here, where I belong.
Darling, you know that I (need your) your wonderful love.
(I need) I need your love. (your love)
Dear, through all my days of mine, I need your love.
Dear, through every phase of mine, I need you love.
Everyday and in everyway.
Hmmm
[Instrumental]
Don't send me away. (Don't send me away)
For I surely be lost.
I'm willing to pay. (Willing to pay)
My life as the cost.
'Cause you know that I (need your love.)
Oh, you know I do. (I need your love)
Oh, I'll cherish you. (I need your love)
Oh, don't be cruel. (I need your love)
