Hmmmmmm.....
Yooooooooou....
need a love like mine
that you can depend on
when your whole world's falling in.
When you need a friend, 
you can depend on me;
you can depend on me.


I'll be by your side...
when you need me...
when the whole world seems unfair...
when no one seems to care,
you can depend on me;
You can depend on me.

When life seems not worth living..
and nothing seems to be going right,
the comfort my love will be giving..giving
will change your darkness to light.

I--I---I--I
I'll be by your side
when you need me
when the whole seems unfair
when no one seems to care,
you can depend depend on
Yeah, yeah,
you can depend on me.
