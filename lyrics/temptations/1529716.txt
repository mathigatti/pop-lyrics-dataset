Listen

Baby I know
That you really think he loves you
And it would hurt you so
If you knew the thing that I knew baby


Cause I see the things
That he does behind your back
And I ask myself
How can he treat you like that

Cause if I had your love
I'd never let you go
And I just don't know

Chorus:

How could he hurt you? (How could he hurt you?)
How could he treat you so bad? (How could he treat you so bad?)
How could he lie to you...(How could he lie to you?)
And have the nerve to say that he loves you?

How could he hurt you? (How could he hurt you?)
How could he cheat on you...(How could he hurt you?)
And say that he cares for you?
He don't deserve to say that he loves you

I know you think
That your love is pure and true
How long can it take
for you to see the pain he's causing you

If I had the chance
I know I'd be the perfect man
Cause he couldn't really know
What a good thing he has

If I had your love
I'd never let you go
And I just don't know

[Chorus]

He don't deserve a lady half as good as you
If I had your love I'd do the things that he won't do
He plays you for a fool
cause he thinks you need him

Bu if you let me
Let me
I said I'll show you what loves about

[Chorus]
