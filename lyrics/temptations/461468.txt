You say you gonna leave me, for the arms of another.
You say my love for you is no good and we can't go any further.
But have pity on me. 
I was blind but know I see.
Stay with me and never walk out of my life.

Because...
Ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')
Oh, ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)

Inspite of all the wrong I've done, I'll make it up to ya.
Even if it takes all my life, I'll prove my love to ya.
So please don't go away.
With me always stay, 'cause I love you.
And I couldn't stand it being away, girl.

Ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')
Oh, ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)

Girl, restore the faith you had in me.
I'm beggin' you down on my knees.
Please don't take your love from me.
Don't leave me, don't leave.

Forgive this fool, for causing your heart to suffer.
Remember two wrongs don't make a right, it'll only make things tougher.
So have little sympathy, on a poor fool like me.
And stay with me, please don't walk out of my life.

Because...
Ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')
Oh, ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)

Oh baby, baby, baby. (I need your lovin')
Oh, woo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)
Oh-oh-oh (I need your lovin')
I need your lovin' baby, baby, baby. (I need your lovin', baby)
Oh, woo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')
I need it, I need it.
