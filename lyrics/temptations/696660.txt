You see this guy, 
This guy's in love with you 
Yes I'm in love, 
I love you the way I do 
When you smile I can tell 
We know each other very well, 
How can I show you? 
I'm glad, I got to know you 'cause 


I heard some talk, 
They say you think I'm fine 
Yes, I'm in love, 
And what I'd do to make you mine 

Tell me now, is it so, 
Don't let me be the last to know 

My hands are shaking, 
Don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause 
I need your love, I want your love 
Say you're in love, in love, with this guy 
If not I'll just die 

Tell me now, is it so, 
Don't let me be the last to know, 

My hands are shaking, 
Don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause 
I need your love, I want your love 
Say you're in love, in love, with this guy 
If not I'll just die
