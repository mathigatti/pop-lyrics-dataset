Sometimes in our lives we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise we know that there's
Always tomorrow


Lean on me when you're not strong and
I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long till I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride if I have things
You need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
that you won't let show

Just call on me brother when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long till 'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on 

Just call on me brother when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

If there is a load you have to bear
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load
if you just call me 

Call me (if you need a friend)
Call me 
Call me (if you need a friend)
Call me (if you ever need a friend)
Call me (call me)
Call me (call me)
Call me (call me)
Call me (call me)
Call me (call me)
Call me (if you need a friend)
Call me (call me)
Call me (call me)
Call me (call me)
