Look what you've done.
You made a fool out of someone. (Out of someone)
You thought love was true and found out that you were just having fun. (Just having fun)


And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After all, I've been good to you. (I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have.

And I recall the time, hmmm, you needed somebody and I made you mine.
You needed a friend so I took you in and treated you so kind.

And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After... After all, I've been good to you. (I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have.

And you know I've always been around.
And I never, never, never let you down.
And now you telling me that you must go.
You know that you're hurting me so-o-o-o-o.

But there, there come a time
One day, one day, one day you gonna wake up and find
You come back to me on your bending knee and you're gonna be crying.

And oh, believe me, what I say it true, baby.
After all, I've been good to you. (I've been good to you)

Everyday... and everyway. (I've been good to you)
Whoa, you know, you know, you know, baby, I've been so good. (I've been good to you)
