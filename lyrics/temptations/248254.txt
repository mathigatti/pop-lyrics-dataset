I never met a girl who makes me feel the way that you do (you're alright)
Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real, I say that you do (you're outta sight)


So, fee-fi-fo-fum
Look out baby, 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come

(Get ready 'cause here I come) I'm on my way
(Get ready 'cause here I come)

If you wanna play hide and seek with love, let me remind you (it's alright)
But the lovin' you're gonna miss and the time it take to find you (it's outta sight)

So, fiddley-dee, fiddley-dum
Look out baby, 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come

(Get ready 'cause here I come) I'm on my way
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
(Ger ready)

[Instrumental]

If all my friends should want you too, I'll understand it. (be alright)
I hope I get to you before they do, the way I planned it. (be outta sight)

So tiddley-dee, tiddley-dum
Look out baby, 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come

(Get ready 'cause here I come) I'm on my way
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
(Get ready 'cause here I come-a)
(Get ready)
