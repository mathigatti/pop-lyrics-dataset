Melvin:
Life lands a freshing blow. 
And once again our heart is broken.
And as history repeats itself.
These few words are sadly spoken.


David:
I've passed this way before.
I've felt this pain before.
A hurt that took so long to end.
Has found my poor heart again.

As I watch love walking away.
It brings back old memories.
But a familiar pain still feels the same.
Once again, heartache has found me.

A dark cloud covered my heart.
Oh, when she told me goodbye.
Now there's nothing left but emptiness.
And the tears that filled my crying eyes.

I've passed this way before.
I've felt this pain before.
A hurt that took so long to end.
Has found my poor heart again.

No matter how strong a man is.
Without a love he walks in the dark, baby.
If love deserts him it would surely hurt him.
'Cause his weakness is his heart.

A lonely journey now stands before me.
The endless pain has started.
But this time I know the way.
Walking alone and broken hearted.

Because I've passed this way before.
And I've felt this pain before.
A hurt that took so long to end.
Has found my poor heart again.

I've passed this way before.
I've felt this pain before.
A hurt that took so long to end.
Has found my poor heart again.
