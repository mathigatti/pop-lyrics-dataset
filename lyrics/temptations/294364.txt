Firefly, Firefly
Shine your light tonight
Assist the Moon and Stars
In helping us
To ease our troubled minds


Firefly, Firefly
Golden night of serenity, yeah
show us the light naturally.
And maybe she wont worry
when there aint nothing I can do.

When sea runs dry 
and the stars fall from the sky
She a vulnerable flower
and she believes in me

Even when I had to lie
I shouldn't have lie
To make the world feel alright
Firefly, Firefly


(Spoken)Um,Um,Um, Sometimes I feel 
I have the weight of the world
on my shoulders. But knowing the
strength she sees in me
I smile because she believes me.


Firefly, Firefly
Golden night of serenity
show me the light naturally.
And maybe she wont worry
when aint nothing I can do.

When sea runs dry 
and the stars fall from the sky
She a vulnerable flower
and she believes in me

Even when I had to lie
I shouldn't have lie
To make the world feel alright
Firefly, Firefly

Ooh,Ooh,Ooh,Ooh,Firefly
You make the world feel alright
