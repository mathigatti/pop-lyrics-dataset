Winds may blow over the icy sea I'll take with me the warmth of thee A taste of honey A taste much sweeter than wine I will return I'll return I'll come back for the honey and you I'll leave behind my heart to wear And may it e'er remind you of A taste of honey A taste much sweeter than wine I will return I'll return I'll come back for the honey and you He ne'er came back to his love so fair And so she
 died dreaming of his kiss His kiss of honey A taste more 
bitter than wine I will return I will return I'll come back
 for the honey and you I'll come back for the honey and you!
