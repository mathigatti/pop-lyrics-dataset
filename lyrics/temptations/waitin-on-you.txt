All I ever wanted
Was you, you, you, you
All I really needed
Is you, you, you, you, you


I wanna be wherever you are
Every step you take rainbows and stars
And you're the type of girl
When I was wrong, you make it right
Where there was darkness but now there's light

'Cause I'm waitin' on you
Yes I'm waitin' on you
Gimme your love, gimme your love
I'm waitin' on you
Yes I'm waitin' on you
Gimme your love, gimme your love

I've got all the time in thte world
'Cause I'm waiting on you
Just to fell that love
All I ever wanted
Was a lady like you, you, you, you
So all I really needed
Is you, you, you, you, you
So I'm waiting on you
Waiting on you
Waiting on you
Waiting on you lady

I've seen beauty in many places
Nothing so beautiful like the msile on your face
Beautiful smiling faces
You even put mona lisa's smile to shame
Yeah, yeah, yeha, yeah
Since I met you darlin nothin'g been the same
Nothing' been the same

So I'm waitin' on you
Yes I'm waitin' on you
Gimme your love, gimme your love
'Cause I'm waitin' on you

I used to run away fast
But now I'm nice and slow
I'm willing to go
How far you wanna go
I know there's a shortage of good men but I'm one
Ain't no rushing you right now
'Cause you know I want it
And you know I need you
And I ain't going nowhere, oh

Oh I'm waitin' on you
Yes I'm waitin' on you
Gimme your love, gimme your love
'Cause I'm waitin' on you

Was you, you, you, you
All I really needed
