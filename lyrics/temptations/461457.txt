Now that you've come back home to me.
I don't care what the people say.


'Cause I'm gonna love you. (Love you till I die)
Hey, love you baby. (Love you till I die)
With every little breath that I take, I'm gonna love you. (Love you till I die)
Hey, just as long as I can see you now. (Love you till I die)
As long as you stay with me, baby. (Love you till I die)

Well, I'm gonna lose my faith in you
If you ever leave me, my whole life would be through.
But right now I'm gonna love you. (Love you)
Hey (Love you, love you)

I'm gonna love you right now. (Love you till I die)
Yeah, love you baby. (Love you till I die)
Yeah, each and every day I'm gonna love you. (Love you till I die)

Just as long as I can put my arms around you, I'm gonna love you. (Love you till I die)
Yeah, loving you. (Love you till I die)

Well, I'm gonna lose every bit of my faith in you
If you ever leave me, my whole life would be through.
But right now I'm gonna love you. (Love you)
Hey (Love you, love you)

I'll love you right now. (Love you till I die)
Yeah, love you right now. (Love you till I die)
All you have to do is keep on loving me, baby.
And I'll love you. (Love you till I die)
Yeah...
