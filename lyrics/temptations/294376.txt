If you decide to make me blue, I'll be in trouble.
If you decide to be untrue, I'll be in trouble.
'Cause no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway.
So if that's what you wanna do, I'll be in trouble.


If you decide one day you want to make a change, love.
You want to leave me here and love a total stranger.
Well, no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway.
So if that's what you wanna do, I'll be in danger.

I'll do everything I can to make you stay,
Keep you by my side. (By my side)
'Cause I love you in such a way, 
Melvin: I have to forget all about my pride.

If you decide you want to go, I'll be in trouble.
I can't prepare myself and soul, I'll be in trouble.
So no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway.
So I just want you to know, I'll be in trouble.
Oh yeah.

If you decide you want to go, I'll be in trouble.
I can't prepare myself and soul, I'll be in trouble.
So no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway.
So I just want you to know, I'll be in trouble.

I'll be in trouble, (So much trouble)
If you ever leave me, baby. (I'll be in trouble)
If you deceive me. (So much trouble)
I must confess, (I'll be in trouble)
My life would be a mess. (So much trouble)
I'll be in trouble, baby. (I'll be in trouble)
So much trouble. (So much trouble)
Hmmm, everyday, trouble. (I'll be in trouble)
And everyway, so much trouble. (So much trouble)
Hmmm, baby. (I'll be in trouble)
So much trouble. (So much trouble)
