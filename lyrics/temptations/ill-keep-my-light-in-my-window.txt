I gotta help the world
Oh listen


Someone is friendless, cannot find their way
So I'll, keep my light in my window

I want to be there, to help restore their faith
So I'll, keep my light in my window

Born of God's mercy
I'd be in their place
So I'll, keep my light in my window

I wanna ease the pain, (that life can bring)
Help them find a peace, mmm (their spirit needs)
Have been chosen for (a work to do)
To make this world a much better place
For me and you

To lend a helping hand
So I'll, keep my light in my window
I feel so good when I help my fellow man
So I'll, keep my light in my window
Till love and mercy are spread throughout the land
So I'll, keep my light in my window

I wanna ease the pain, (that life can bring)
Help them find a peace, mmm (their spirit needs)
Have been chosen for (a work to do)
To make this world a much better place
For me and you
