Girl i can't believe my ears
Are you really telling me goodbye
See you're really taking away my reason for living
And you won't even tell me why
Before you walk out the door
There's something i want you to know
That i could never love another after loving you
No other love would i share
Because none could compare after loving you


It was only yesterday
Your words were still fresh in my mind
Baby you said long as the rivers flow
Each day you'd love me more
Now you want to leave me behind
Listen baby, i don't know what
It's gonna take to make you stay
I just know i got to find a way
Cause i could never, never, never
Love another after loving you
No other love would i share
Cause none could compare after loving you

So baby, please stay beside me
I need your sweet love to guide me
Oh baby, baby, baby
I would never love another after loving you
I could never love another after loving you
Baby, baby, baby

It was only, only, only, only yesterday
Your words were still fresh in my mind
I remember you said long as the rivers flow
Each day you'd love me more
Now you want to leave, leave me behind
Listen baby, i don't know what
It's gonna take to make you stay
I just know i've got to find a way
Cause i could never, never, never
Love another after loving you

No other love would i share
Cause none, none could compare after loving you
Oh baby on my bended knees
I'm beggin' you to stay here with me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby
I could never, never love another after loving you
No other love would i share
Cause none could compare after loving you
