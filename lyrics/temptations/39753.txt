You played hooky from school
And you can't go out and play, yeah
Mama said, for the rest of the week
In your room, you gotta' stay, yeah


Now you feel like
The whole world's pickin' on you
Temptations: Now you feel like
The whole world's pickin' on you
But deep down inside
You know ain't true

You're on punishment
'Cause your mama wants to raise you the right way, yeah
But you don't care
'Cause you already made up your mind
You wanna' run away, yeah
You're on your way

Runaway child, runnin' wild
Runaway child, runnin' wild
You better go back home
Better go back home
Where you belong
Where you belong

You're roamin' through the city
Goin' nowhere fast
You're on your own at last
Hey, it's getting late, where will you sleep?
Gettin' kind of hungry
You forgot to bring somethin' to eat
Oh, lost with no money
You start to cry
But remember, you left home
Wantin' to be grown
So dry your weepin' eyes

Sirens screaming down neon-lighted streets
You want your mama
All day lookin' for you
You're frightened and confused
I want my mama
But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say
Run, run, run

You heard some frightening news
On the radio
About little boys runnin' away from home
And their parents don't see 'em no more
You want to stop and hitch a ride
I know
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go

The streets are dark and deserted
Not a sound or sign of life, huh
Oh how you gonna' hear your mother's voice
'Cause your lost and alone
But remember you made this choice, oh

Runaway child, runnin' wild
You better go back home
Where you belong
Runaway child, runnin' wild
You better go back home
Where you belong
Your lost in this great big city
You better go back home
Where you belong
Huh, not one familiar face, ain't it a pity!!
Go back home, where you belong
Oh, runaway child, runnin' wild
You better go back home
Where you belong, oh yeah

Mama mama please, come on see about me
But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say
I want my mama
Whoa, you're frightened and confused
Which way will you choose

Listen to your heartbeat
It's beating much too fast
Go back home
Where you belong

Oh hard head, ah-ha hard head
Oh hard head, ah-ha hard head
