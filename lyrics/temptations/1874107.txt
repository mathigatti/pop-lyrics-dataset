(Barbara... my love...)


If Barbara were an angel, I pray she'd watch over me.
(Wo-oh-oh)
If Barbara were a queen, her servant I would be.
(Wo-oh-oh)
If Barbara would be mine and wear my high school ring,
then I'd climb the highest mountain, do just anything.
(Di dit di dit)
(Di dit di dit)
(Di dit di dit dit)

If Barbara were the winter chill, I'd stand out in the cold.
(Wo-oh-oh)
If Barbara were a tree her, branches I would hold.
(Wo-oh-oh)
If Barbara would love me, and say that she'd be mine,
I'd swim the deepest ocean, stop the hands of time.

Barbara, please say...
(that you're in love, in love with me.)
Don't let me lead...
(this life, a life of misery.)
Wo-oh-oh
Let me kiss your tender lips and know your secret charms,
and let me know what real love is and hold you in my arms.

And if this love I pray for, should it all come true,
(Wo-oh-oh)
then, with all my heart, dear, I'd love no one but you.
(Wo-oh-oh)
I'll hold you in my arms, for now and evermore
and we will walk together through love's sacred door.

(Barbara...)
Barbara...
Barbara... my love...

Barbara...
Barbara...
Barbara... my love...

Barbara...
Barbara...
