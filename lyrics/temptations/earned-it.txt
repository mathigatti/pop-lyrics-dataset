You make it look like it's magic (oh yeah)
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused, hey, hey
I'm so used to being used


So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
So I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Girl, you earned it
Girl, you earned it, yeah

You know our love would be tragic (oh yeah)
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind
We live with no lies, hey
You're my favorite kind of night

So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you, yeah yeah

On that lonely night
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it was only us
Convinced we were broken inside, yeah, inside, yeah

'Cause girl, you're perfect (girl, you're perfect)
You're always worth it (you're always worth it)
And you deserve it (and you deserve it)
The way you work it (the way you work it)
Girl, you've earned it
Girl, you've earned it, yes you did

You're always worth it
And you deserve it
'Cause girl, you're worth it

Still you're perfect (yeah you're perfect)
Always worth it (you're always worth it)
And you deserve it (and you deserve it)
The way you work it (the way you work it)
