Hey, it's The Temptations, come on in

Man it sounds good
Uh, come on (uh)
Move them britches
(Wait a minute listen)
Move them britches
Listen


Some spirits are just from down below
From the heathens just can't help themselves, no
Your shifting is a necessary evil
In the [?] are celebrating my people
Listen, y'all don't wanna think no more
These smartphones, y'all just wanna
Shake your thing on the dancefloor
Keep moving and grooving, ah
Yeah, but [?] is coming home (real soon) ooh

Yeah, till then you can believe in your false future
Go ahead and do what you do
[?] It's all heavy heart
Well fix her another drink on me

Move them britches (oh)
Shake it gal
Move them britches
Come on babe, come on
See it's your world
Move them britches
Oh, wait a minute now
Is that [?]
Move them britches, ooh
Yo, you know what I'm saying

Get your freak on
That's what you gonna do
Ain't got no worries, girl
With new nails and a half do
You hope that I'm looking
(I am, I am) What?
You know what you doing, you in your crew
[?] Won't you come over? Alright
All of you to the floor, oh girl
I then get sweet on you, losing my mind
Feeling so fine, gonna watch you dance
[?] Things, diamonds can be in your feature
I promise there ain't [?] like me
Although I need to show you
But you don't wanna talk
You just wanna play your games (blasé, blasé)

Move them britches
Move them britches
Move them britches
Move them britches
Move them britches, eh
Go on, it's your world
Move them britches
Come on now, shake it gal
Move them britches
Come on now [?]
Move them britches
Hey, I gotta [?]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
