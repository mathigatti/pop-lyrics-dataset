City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style, In the air there's a feeling of Christmas. Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile, And on every street corner you hear Silver bells, silver bells, 
it's Christmastime in the city. Hear the bells go ding-a-
ling, hear them ring, Soon it will be Christmas day. 
Strings of street lights, even stop lights blink a bright red and green As the shoppers rush home with their 
treasures. Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this 
is Santa's big scene, And above all this bustle you hear 
Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmastime in the city. Hear the bells go ding-a-ling, hear them ring, Soon it will be Christmas day.
