So in love, sad as could be
'Cause a pretty face got the best of me.
Suddenly, you came into my life
And gave it meaning and pure delight.
Now, good looks, I've learned to do without.
'Cause now I know it's love that really counts.


'Cause I know that...
(Beauty's only skin deep, yeah, yeah, yeah.)
I know that... 
Beauty's only skin deep, yes indeed.

Now you speak your words warm and sincere.
And let's me know that your love is near.
A pretty face you may not possess
But what I like about you is your tenderness.
A pretty face maybe some guys taste
But I'll take lovin' in it's place.

'Cause I know that...
(Beauty's only skin deep, yeah, yeah, yeah.)
And you know that...
Beauty's only skin deep, oh baby, oh yeah.
(Oh yeah, Oh yeah)

(Beauty's only skin deep, yeah, yeah, yeah.)
Ooo
(Beauty's only skin deep, oh yeah.)
Yes it is.

My friends ask, what do I see in you
But it goes deeper than the eye can view.
You have a pleasin' personality
And that's an ever lovin' rare quality.
Now show me a girl, a girl that's fine
And I'll choose the one with true lovin' every time.

I know that...
(Beauty's only skin deep, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I believe that...
Beau- know that beauty's only skin deep.

So if you're lookin' for a lover. (Oh yeah)
Don't judge a book by it's cover. (Oh yeah)
She may be fine on the outside (Oh yeah)
But so untrue on the inside. (Oh yeah)
Ooo
