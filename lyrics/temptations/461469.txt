I'm sending you red roses and violets.
(Violets of...) blue, girl.
The roses mean I love you.
The violets mean I'll always be true, girl. (Be true, girl)


Because I really love you.
And I truly, truly believe, yes I do.
Inspite of the way you acting, that you love me too.
Come on and say it dear.

Hmm, you try, to keep me away, girl.
Just to prove you don't really care.
But I believe you feel the same way I do.
And this torture just ain't fair. (No, this torture just ain't fair) 

I'm sending you a bracelet.
In grave in gold that, "I love you" girl. (Love you, girl)
And I'll send my heart if I could, to prove I'll always be true, girl.

Because I really love you.
And I truly, truly believe, yes I do.
Inspite of the way you acting, that you love me too.
Come on and say it dear.
Oh, say it dear.

[Instrumental]

I hope you'd understand.
That the red roses and violets of blue, girl, (Hope you'd understand)
And that bright shining bracelet, help me, baby, say 'I love you'. (I love you. Love you)

And I really love you.
And I truly, truly believe, yes I do. (Yes, I do)
I believe that you love me.
So baby, come on and say it.

A-Say it. (I truly believe, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do)
I truly, truly believe. (I truly believe, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do)
(I truly believe, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do)
