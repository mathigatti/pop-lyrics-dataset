No more water in the well, no more.
No more water in the well, no more.


You take my love
for granted like water,
water you spell and you wast.

Though love is thicker
than water it spells quicker
than water and you´ll lookup
one of these days,
and there´ll be no more
water in the well.

How long do you think
my love can last thruogh sorrow pain and mistrust?

Today my love is strong,
but keep doing me wrong
and tomorrow it may
turn to dust
