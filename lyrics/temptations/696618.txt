It's not her symphony
Chilling out her rhapsody
It's just a simple melody i wrote for you


Oh hear my lullaby of love (hear my lullaby of love)
Love that's crying out to you (crying out to you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I had a price to pay (price to pay)
Ever since that awful day (awful day)
I got up and walked away from you sweetheart

Oh hear my lullaby of love (hear my lullaby of love)
Love that's tearing me apart (tearing me apart)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

La la la la la
Crying out to you
I can't go on like this
After haven't tasted bliss
With every warm and tender kiss you gave to me

Oh hear my lullaby of love (hear my lullaby of love)
Love that haunts my rebelry
Oh hear my lullaby of love (hear my lullaby of love)
Love that needs your symphony
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooooooh
