You never close your eyes anymore when i kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your finger tips
You're trying hard not to show it
But baby, baby i know it
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Oh that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone gone gone oh oh oh
There's no welcome look in your eyes when i reach for you
And girl you're starting to criticize little things i do
Ooh, it makes me just feel like crying (baby)
'cause baby something beautiful's dying
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Oh that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Not it's gone gone gone oh oh oh
Baby baby i get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to
We had a love, a love that you don't find everyday
So don't don't don't let it slip away (away)
I said baby
Baby
Baby
Baby
I need your love (i need your love)
I need your love
So bring it on back (bring it on back)
Now bring it on back
Now bring it on back
You've got to bring back that lovin' feeling
Oh that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling 'cause it's gone gone gone
Oh oh oh
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Oh that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling 'cause it's gone gone gone
