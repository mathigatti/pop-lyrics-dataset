Like the beat, beat, beat, Of the tom-tom; When the jungle shadows fall, Like the tick, tick, tock Of the stately clock, As it stands against the wall, Like the drip, drip, drip, Of the raindrops, When the summer show'r is through; So a voice within me Keeps repeating, You, you, you -- Night and day You are the one, Only you Beneath the moon And under the sun. Whether near to me or far, It's no 
matter, Darling, where you are I think of you Night and
 day. Day and night Why is it so, That this longing for you
 follows Where-ever I go? In the roaring traffic's boom, In the silence of my lonely room, I think of you, Night and day. Night and day Under the hide of me There's an Oh, such a hungry yearning, Burning inside of me. And its torment won't be through Til you let me spend my life Making love to you, Day and night, Night and day
