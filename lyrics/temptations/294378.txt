As I stand alone on this moonful night.
For the first time I feel alone in life.
As I watched the moon kissed the star-lit skies.
I feel the need for your lips to press close to mine.


For so long, I've been afraid to love.
But right now I feel a need for love.
And you have the love, love I need. (Right now)
Aw, to comfort me.

Ooo, and I'm ready for love. (Ready for love)
I'm truly ready for love. (Ready for love)
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love. (Sweet, sweet love)
Ooo, and I'm ready for love.

I tried to shield my heart from love tender touch.
'Cause to lose a love, aw, would hurt so much.
But as I softly walked in my solitude.
I search my heart and I found there's a need for you.

And for the first time I feel alone.
'Cause I need a love, aw, to call my own.
And only you, have the love, the love I need.
Aw, to comfort me.

Ooo, and I'm ready for love. (Ready for love)
I'm truly ready for love. (Ready for love)
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love. (Sweet, sweet love)
Aw, and I'm ready for love.

I ready (right now.)

And for the first time I feel alive.
Have the tender love, deep down inside.
And just as soon as I see a smiling face,
I rush into your warm embrace.

Right now, I'm ready for love.
I'm truly ready for love.
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love.
Right now, I'm ready for love.
Comfort me, baby. (?)
Aw, I'm ready for love.
Wonderful sweet, sweet love.
Aw, I'm ready for love.
