I know you wanna leave me,
But i refuse, to let you go.
If i have to beg, plead, for your sympathy
I don't mind, 'cause you mean that much to me.


Chorus:
Ain't too proud to beg (sweet darlin'.)
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go.)
Ain't to proud to plead (baby,baby)
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go.)

Now i've heard a cryin' man,
Is half a man,
With no sense of pride.
But if i have to cry to keep you, i don't mind weepin',
If it'll keep you by my side.

Chorus

If i have to sleep on your doorstep,
All night and day,
Just to keep you from walkin' away.
Let your friends laugh, even this i can stand,
'cause i wanna keep you, anyway i can!

Chorus

Now i've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart,
And each day it grows more and more.
I'm not ashamed to come, and plead to you baby,
If pleadin' keeps you from, walking out that door!

Chorus
