What's so good about goodbye
All it does is make you cry
Well if leavin' causes grief
Goodbye can break your heart
Tell me what's so good about goodbye
I could have done without it
Won't somebody tell me now
How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares
And another thing I would like to clarify
Is how can farewell be fair
I could have done without it
Ah, you and I could never say this is goodbye
Girl, well it makes me so sad
Until it's got to be bad
Tell me what's so good about goodbye
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye
Baby, baby what's so good about goodbye
You said goodbye to me
All I've known is misery
But if everything goes wrong lovers stay so long
Tell me what's so good about goodbye
I could have done without it
Won't somebody tell me now
How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares
And another thing I would like to clarify
Is how can farewell be fair
I could have done without it
