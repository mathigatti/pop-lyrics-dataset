Ooh... ooh... oh... ooh... oh... ooh...
Ooh... ooh... oh... ooh...
Ooh, yeah, baby
Whoa... whoa... oh... oh...
Mmm...


Now I'm the kinda guy who don't believe
That chivalry is dead, no
'Cause I believe a woman should be treated
With the utmost respect, mmm... hmm...

Don't be afraid, don't turn and walk away
I wanna get to know ya, well
Don't be ashamed, don't say that love's to blame
Just come and look me over

(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, woo... hoo...

Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up (Yeah) her hanky (Yeah) off the floor
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)
Light her cigarette if she smokes
Even (Help her with her coat), well
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)

In this world of liberation
It's so easy to forget, mmm...
That it's so nice to have a man around
To lend a helping hand, you can bet, bet you can, baby

When I was young, my mama used to say, "Boy
A woman's like a flower, with love on her you shower"
Ever since that day, her words never went away
I always will remember to treat my baby tender

(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, whoa... ooh... ooh...

Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up (Yeah) her hanky (Yeah) off the floor
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)
Light her cigarette if she smokes
Even (Help her with her coat), oh, whoa
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)

Compliment her in her hair
Even help her with her chair
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)
She's a bad son-of-a-gun
I'm her lovin' Don Juan
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)

Ooh... hoo... hoo... hoo... hoo... ooh...
Whoa... oh... oh...
Hey... hey...
Whoa... oh... oh... oh... oh... baby
Every day, ever way
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, whoa... whoa... oh... ooh...

Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up (Yeah) her hanky (Yeah) off the floor
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)
Light her cigarette if she smokes
Even (Help her with her coat), help her out
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)

Compliment her in her hair
Even help her with her chair
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)
Now boy, you should remember
To be a gentleman
Treat her like a lady

(You better) Treat her like (Well), treat her like (Ho)
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like a lady)
Treat her like, treat her like (Hey... ey...)
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like a lady)

Treat her like (Well), treat her like
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like a lady)
Treat her like, treat her like (Ooh... hoo...)
Treat her like a lady (Hoo... hoo... oh, my, my, treat her like a lady)
