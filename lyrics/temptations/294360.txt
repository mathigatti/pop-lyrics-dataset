The feeling we used to get, whenever our lips met
Like smoke from a cigarette, it's fading away
Fading away, fading away
It hurts me to think about, how love where there was no doubt
Like a cloud when the sun comes out, it's fading away
Fading away, fading away
Hmm, you've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing
Tell me, where is your love going?
The plans we were making up, for I'll never breaking up
Like dreams when you're waking up, are fading away
Fading away, fading away
The good times we shared alot, when you really cared alot
Like steam from a coffee pot, it's fading way
Fading away, fading away
You've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing
Tell me, where is your love going?


Like smoke from a cigarette, of dreams that you soon forget
Our love from the day we met, it's fading away
Fading away, fading away
You've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing
Tell me, where is your love going?
Going
You've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing
Tell me, where is your love going?
Going
