Ooo
Your love is fading, I can feel your love fading.
Girl, it's fading away from me.


'Cause your touch, your touch has grown cold.
As if someone else controls your very soul.
I've fooled myself long as I can.
Can feel the presence of another man.

It's there when you speak my name.
It's just not the same.
Ooo baby, I'm losing you.
It's in the air, it's everywhere.
Ooo baby, I'm losing you. (Losing you)

When I look into your eyes.
A reflection of a face I see.
I'm hurt, downhearted, and worried girl.
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me.

Oh, it's all over your face.
Someone's taken my place.
Ooo baby, I'm losing you.
You try hard to hide.
The emptiness inside.
Ooo, I can tell I'm losing you. 
Ooo (Losing you)
I don't wanna lose you.

[Instrumental]

Ooo, I can tell when we kiss.
From the tenderness I miss.
Ooo little girl, I'm losing you.

Girl, I can feel it in my bones.
In a day you'll be gone.
Oh baby, I'm losing you.

Oh, my dear.
What happened to the love we shared?
Oh baby, I'm losing you.

I know it's true.
There's someone new.
Oh baby, baby, I'm losing you.
