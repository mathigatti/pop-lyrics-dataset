Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see 
A world where men are free 
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars 
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmas we'll see a Man
No hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shinning moment my heart ran away
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me 
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmas man will not fail 
Take hope because your love will prevail 
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me 
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmastime
