Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go as plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?


Oh won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
So won't you stay with me

Why am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

Oh won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
Oh won't you stay with me

Stay with me
All I need
Stay with me

Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need, yeah
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me (Stay-yeah-yeah)

(Stay with me) Ah, stay with me yeah
(All I need)
This ain't love, it's clear to see
Oh won't you stay with me
Eh, come on, come on, darling

Stay with me (I want you to stay with me baby)
All I need (All I need is you)
This ain't love, it's clear
Won't you stay with me

Don't go
