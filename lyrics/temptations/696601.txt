(Loneliness Made Me Realize)It's you that I need

Ooooh Lonely man in my eye, ever since you said goodbye, girl I know that I should have woke up, cuz i see ya now that we've broke up,
your fairwell kiss is haunting mee, my tootin lips cry out constantly, 
let your heart let your heart be your guide, 
(forget about your foolish prid)

(Baby I keep tellin, I keep tellin, baby I keep tellin)
starting tomorrow I keep telling myself, 
im gonna get out and find somebody else, 
somebody thats sweet and kind who will erase you out of my miiind, 
but tell me how could I find somebody new baby, 
when my two arms keep reaching out for you, 
and my two lips keep right on repeating, 
its you that I need oooooohh, 
you know that even when I close my eyes to forget ya, 
I see your face and your memories too,
