My lady soul
Laying near beside you
Close as we can be
I know what this leads to
I know what you need. Yeah


I'm ready to remember
My love, laying it all on your hands
Give you mine forever
Everything I am

'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I go cold
Oh you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole

Whoa
My lady soul

I fell it in you heartbeat
Hear it in your cries
This is where our hearts meet
I see it in your eyes

I've been waiting for this moment
My love, it's a dream come alive
Heaven must have sent me
An angel of the night

'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I go cold
'Cause you are my, you're my, you're my, my lady soul
You're my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole

Hmm, I've always knew we end up together
Right from the very start
I believe we will make it forever
It's written right here in my heart
Oh yeah

You're my, you're my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I get cold
Oh, you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole

Whoa
My lady soul

Ooo (my, my)
Ooo (my, my)
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
(My, my) my lady soul
