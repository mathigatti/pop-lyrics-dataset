Some people are always heaven made
Some people will live impermanent for the rest of their days
Time marches on
Yesterday is better than tomorrow
Life is uncertain, let me hear you say 'yeah'
That is that, oh yes it is
There'll be days of sunshine and laughter
But don't forget you will have to shed some tears - oho


It's the law of the land - my brother - oh
Whether you like it or you'll understand - ah hey hey
It's the law of the land - hey hey hey hey
'Cause made by almighty men

Live by the good book if you're able
You must play your cards on top of the table
When you gather you either win or lose
In life's ev'rybody's got to pay some dues - well

It's the law of the land - well well well
Whether you'll like it or you'll understand - you can't change it
It's the law of the land - ah-how
'Cause made by almighty men - oh hey

Hey, it's the law, the law of the land 
Whether you'll like it or you'll understand
It's the law, the law of the land 
'Cause made by almighty men

A teacher man can't be found
Until you find yourself - think about it
You might not like being, well you ought, but you'd better start like it
But you sure can't be nobody else
In other words: I can't be you - ain't no quit, yeah - you can't be me
Well well, that's all with you, my sister an' brother
And that's the way that good life meant to be - hey-ho

It's the law of the land - well
Whether you like it or you'll understand - say say
It's the law of the land - hey yeah oh
'Cause made by almighty men

Look at here
The tools of a ????man's day has got him by corrupt????
For your own protection your Gods you must love
What goes around comes around
And what goes up, yeah, must come down - aha

It's the law of the land - well well well well
Whether you like it or you'll understand 
It's the law of the land - well well well
'Cause made by almighty men - aha

It's the law of the land - ev'rybody else say
Whether you like it or you'll understand ...
