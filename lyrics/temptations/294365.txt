For once in my life
I have someone who needs me.
Someone I needed so long.
For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me.
Some how I know I'll be strong.
For once I can touch
What my heart used to dream of.
Long before I knew.
Aww, someone like you
Would make my dream come true.
For once in my life
I won't let sorrow hurt me.
Not like it's hurt me before.
For once I have something
I know won't desert me.
I'm not alone anymore.
For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it.
As long as I know
I have love I can make it.
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me.
For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it.
Long as I know
I have love I can make it.
For once I can feel
That somebody heard my plea.
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me.
(For once in my life)
(In my life)
