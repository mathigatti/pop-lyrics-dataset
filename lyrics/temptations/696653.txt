(That's how heartaches are made) (That's how heartaches are made) 
They told me I was such a fool to love you 
They say that you're the kind who'd never be true 
Pretty soon the day would come When I'd be the sorry one But I said that I'm not afraid, well That's how heartaches are made That's how heartaches are made I went ahead and my heart opened the door I gave you so much love no-one could want more You pretended to be mine How could you be so unkind? With all the other girls you played, well That's how heartaches are made That's how heartaches are made That's how heartaches are made That's how heartaches are made I know you're not sincere And you'll never be But still I want your kisses so desperately I can never let you go Baby, you know I know Every rule of love you disobeyed, well That's how heartaches are made That's how heartaches are made That's how heartaches are made
