Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio doesn't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is tear me down
My heart breaks a little when I hear your name


It all just sounds like oooooh
Too young, too dumb to realize
I should've bought you flowers (flowers)
And held your hand (held your hand)
Gave you all my hours (hours)
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance (dance)
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways. Oh
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
'Cause I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And it haunts [?] when I close my eyes

It all just sounds like oooooh
Oooh, too young, too dumb to realize
I should've bought you flowers (flowers)
Should've held your hand (held your hand)
Should've gave you all my hours (hours)
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope been brings the flowers (flowers)
And holds your hand
Give you all his hours (hours)
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
All the things I should've
When I was your man
All the things I should've
I was your man
