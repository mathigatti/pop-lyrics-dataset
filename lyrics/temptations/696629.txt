Dennis: well boys and girls, it's christmas time again
so you better watch out
you better not cry
better not pout
im telling you why
santa clause is coming to town
he's making a list
and checking it twice
gonna find out who's naughty or nice
santa clause is coming to town
he sees you when you're sleeping
he knows when you're awake
he knows if you've been bad or good
so be good for goodness sake
oh, you better watch out
you better not cry
better not pout 
im telling you why
santa clause is coming to town

he knows if you've been bad or good 
so be good for goodness sake
oh, so you better watch out

and little toy drums
