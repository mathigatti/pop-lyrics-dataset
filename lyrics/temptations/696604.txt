Calling out to everyone across the nation
Said the world is in a desperate situation
Stealing, burning, fighting, killing
Nothing but corruption
It looks like mankind in on the eve of destruction
Oh yes it is now people let me tell you now
We've got to learn to live with each other
No matter what the race, creed or color
I just got to tell you what the world needs now
Is love and understanding get aboard the friendship train
Everybody shake a hand make a friend now
Listen to us now, we're doing our thing
On the friendship train


We've got to start today to make tomorrow
A brighter day for our children
Oh calm down people now we can do it
I can prove it but only if our hearts are willing
Now get aboard the friendship train
Everybody, shake a hand, shake a hand
Yes I'm talking about the friendship train
It don't matter what you look like
People or who you are
If your heart is in the right place 
In the right place
Talking about the right palce 
You're welcome aboard now

This train stands for justice, 
This train stands for freedom
This train stands for harmony and peace
This train stands for love
Come on get on the friendship train
People listen to me now
Harmony is the key my sisters and brothers
Oh yes it is I say
Harmony is the key my sisters and brothers
People can't wait cause another day might be too late
Come on get on the friendship train
