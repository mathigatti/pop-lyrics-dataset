My baby it's been a while since I've seen your pretty face
I'm happy to see you looking healthy, you represent your race


Smile for me
A smile that used to take me places
Made me make some funny faces
Laugh for me
The light that makes me feel warm inside
Like cocoa on a winter day

You're the one I wanna love forever
Take my breath away

So won't you be my wife
I'm begging you to
Bless me with your love
A love so true
Won't you be my wife
I'm begging you
Bless me with your love

My darling, I'm never gonna see the day that I'm not in love with you
I'll never forget the first time you held my hand, oh

When it's rainy
My umbrella
When it's sunny
I shower you with money
Get it through your head
There's nothing I won't do

You're love's a [?]
I'll be right there for you

So won't you be my wife
I'm begging you to
Bless me with your love
A love so true
Won't you be my wife
I'm begging you
Bless me with your love
Oh yeah

You're the only one I wanna see
Don't ever take your love away (from me)
You're the only one I wanna hear forever
We'll be making love (all I need is you my dear, my dear)
You're only girl I wanna (come on, I know)
No I'm never gonna let your love go (I won't let you go, let you go no)

Won't you be my wife
Oh yeah
Bless me with your love
I wanna marry you right now
Won't you be my wife
Here we stand at the altar and the vow
Bless me with your love
