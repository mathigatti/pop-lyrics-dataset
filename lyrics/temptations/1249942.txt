Hey where did we go
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughing and a running hey, hey
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl 


Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mind
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the water fall, with you
My brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl 

Do you remember when we used to sing
Shalalalalalaladeeda
Shalalalalalaladeeda
Laadeeda
Shalalalalalaladeeda

So I had to find my way
Now that I'm on my own
Saw you the other day
And my how you have grown
Cast my memory back there lord hey
Now I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Shalalalalalaladeeda
Ladeeda
Shalalalalalaladeeda
My brown eyed girl
Shalalalalalaladeeda
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Shalalalalalaladeeda
Shalalalalalaladeeda
Laadeeda
Shalalalalalaladeeda
Your my brown eyed girl
