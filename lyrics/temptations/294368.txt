(Duh-da-da-da, Duh-da-da-da, Duh-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Like the birds in the trees, my heart sings a rhapsody of love for you.
Girl, you won my heart the very first time I layed eyes on you.
I know your love belongs to someone else.
But girl, I got to have you for myself.
So, I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo.
Gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo.
A fallen star that's what you are, from the heavens above.
There's no treasure on earth, that can match your worth.
You're a picture of love.
I know to you I'm just a love sick guy.
But you're wrong.
I love ya and I need you, by my side.
So, I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo.
I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo.
Aw, yeah.
Baby.
Keep on.
I can't help but thinkin' 'bout that guy. 
He jus' got you by his side.
He's got everything.
There's is no inch of his happiness to be in his place.
I'll be glad to give you anything.
I know your love belongs to him.
But girl, I can't be satisfied jus' being your friend.
So, I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo.
Gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love.
Everyday, baby.
Gonna keep on trying, got to just keep on trying till I win your love.
No matter what it takes.
I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love.
