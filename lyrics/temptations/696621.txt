There's a christmas tree in a window frame
Just inside my door
But my christmas tree doesn't look the same
As it always has before
There's just one lonely present
Beneath my christmas tree
Cause the best little present a guy could have
Has gone away from me


Oh my christmas tree isn't very big
In fact it's kind of small
Oh it's funny when she'd pick them out
They'd always seem so tall
The light doesn't seem so bright this year
It's hard for me to see
The smile that made my christmas right
Has gone away from me

I have been so lonely
Since you left me all alone
All i want for christmas
Is my baby, my baby back home
Oh my christmas tree is so sad and bare
My roon so big and cold
Oh they wish me happy new year
But the new year's already old
There's no, no little angel
On top where she used to be
Cause the angel that made my christmas right
Has gone away from me
Cause the angel that made my christmas right
Has gone away from me
Cause the angel that made my christmas right
Has gone away from me
Cause the angel. . .
