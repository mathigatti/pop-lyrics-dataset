It would be easier to take the wet from water or the dry from sand 
Than for anyone to try to separate us or stop us from holding hands, 'cause... 
CHORUS: 
I love you, I love you from the bottom of my heart 
And what love has joined together, what love has joined together 
Can't nobody take it apart 
It would be easier to take the cold from the snow or the heat from fire 
Than for anyone to take my love from you 'cause you're my heart's desire, &amp;... 
(chorus) 
Even if they separate us a thousand miles apart 
We will still be together in each other's hearts 
It would be easier to change all the seasons of the year 
Than for anyone to change the way I feel about you; I love you dear 
(chorus) 
(title twice, then fade)
