Many a man has gone away
Many a man has gone astray
Searching for the treasures of a love that's true
I'm hoping that my treasure can be you
Cause I believe, I believe 


The further you look 
Show love now
The less you see
I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me

I've seen men carry their hopes from town to town
Trying to track lost treasures down
Some find true love before their hopes are gone
Others lose hope and they have to --yes, now -- move on
And I can hear them say as they go down

The further you look, 
You better know that
The less you see
So I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me 

Oh-oh-oohhh-oh
Travel, travelling on
Wondering if they've done something wrong
Moving on becoming a rover
But if you'll be mine, my searching is all over because now

The further you look,
Show love now
The less you see
I'm hoping you'll be the treasure meant for me 

And I know, I know, I know
The further you look, 
the less you're gonna see
so I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me

And I believe, I believe right now
The further you look,
the less you're gonna see
so I'm hoping you'll be the treasure meant for me
