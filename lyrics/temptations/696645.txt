Some enchanted evening you may see a stranger 
You may see a stranger across a crowded room And somehow you know, you know even then 
That somewhere you'll see her again and again Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing You may hear her laughing across a crowded room 
And night after night, as strange as it seems The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams Who can explain it, who can tell you why Fools give you reasons, wise men never try Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love When you feel her call you across a crowded room Then fly to her side and make her your own Or all through your life you may dream all alone Once you have found her, never let her go Once you have found her, never let her go
