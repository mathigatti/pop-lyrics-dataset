A rose is a beautiful flower. I mean the prettiest in the world. 
And that goes double, double for a girl. 
Cause she's like no other flower in the world. 
Remeber, they that first take the sweet. 
But you got to take the bitter with sweet. 
So remeber: he who picks a rose must accept the thorns it bear. 
yeah, yeah. 
Talking about the goood and the bad in a woman.
