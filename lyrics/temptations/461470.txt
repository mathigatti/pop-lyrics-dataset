Eddie:
I will build you a castle with a tower so high, till it reach as the moon.
I'll gather melodies from birdies that fly, and compose you a tune.
Give you lovin' as warm as Mama's oven.
And if that don't do, then I'll try something new. (I'll try something new)


Diana:
Oh, I will take you away with me as far as I can.
To Venus or Mars.
There we will love with your hand in my hand.
You'll be king of the stars.
Every day we can play on the Milky Way.
If that don't do.
I'll have to try something new. (I'll try something new)

Melvin:
I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea...
(Yeah, to wear in your hair)

Diana:
Thank you.
I'll do anything and everything to make you happy, boy.
To show you that I care... I care.

Eddie:
I'll pretend I'm jealous of all the fellas and if that don't do.
I'll try something new.

Ooo, something new. (I'll try something new)
I'll try something new. (I'll try something new)
Something new. (I'll try something new)
I'll try something new. (I'll try something new)
If that boy don't suceed, try again and then you'll see. (I'll try something new)
Something new. (I'll try something new)
Something new.
