Oooh
Oooh, isn't she pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, pretty
Oooh, isn't she a doll (She's a doll, now)


Uh huh, she's so fine. (So fine)
Gee, I wish she was mine.

Oooh, isn't she pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, pretty
Oooh, isn't she a doll (Hey, she's a natural doll, now)

She's the kind of girl all of my life, now.
I wanted it, to be my wife.
Because...

She's got it, without a doubt.
She really knocks me out.
I can't do without her love.

Oooh
Oooh, isn't she pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, pretty
Oooh, isn't she a doll? (Hey, she's a natural doll, now)

"Oh do you know, you know you're a pretty little thing?"
"I really want to be your man."

"No, no, no... do you know why?"

"Why?"

"You ain't got just what it takes."

Oooh
Oooh, isn't she pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, pretty
Oooh, isn't she a doll (Hey, she's a natural doll, now)

Everytime she comes near me.
My words just-a disappear.

Here she comes now.
Jus' the walk.
Listen to her sweet, sweet talk.
I can't do without her love.

Oooh
Oooh, isn't she pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, pretty
Oooh, isn't she a doll (She's a doll, now)

She... so fine, so fine, so fine.
I... I wish she were mine, all mine.
She... so fine, so fine, so fine.
I... I wish she were mine, all mine.
She... so fine, so fine, so fine.
I... I wish she were mine, all mine.
