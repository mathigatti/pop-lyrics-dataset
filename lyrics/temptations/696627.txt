Paul:
You Know there's Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen.


Dennis:
Comet and Cupid an Donner and Blitzen.

Eddie:
Oh, but do you recall...

Otis:
The most famous reindeer of all?

Eddie:
Whoa-o-o-o-o

Melvin:
His name is...

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw it.
You would even say it glows.

All of the other, other, other reindeer.
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph.
Join in any reindeer games.

(Then one foggy Christmas eve)
You know (Santa came to say...)

(Hey Rudolph)
You, with your nose so bright.
Melvin: Come on, come on, come on, come on and guide my sleigh tonight.

Then how the reindeer loved him.
As they shouted out with glee. (Hey Rudolph) 
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.
You'll go down in history.

Ooo, Rudolph, come on and guide my sleigh.
Ooo, Rudolph, come on and guide my sleigh.
Hey, hey, hey, Rudolph, come on and guide my sleigh tonight.
Hey, hey, hey, Rudolph, with your nose so bright.
