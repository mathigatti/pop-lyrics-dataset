I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Though you treat me badly
I love you madly
You really got a hold on me (you really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me (you really got a hold on me), baby


I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you,
but I need to
Though you do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You really got a hold on me (you really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me (you really got a hold on me), baby

I love you and all I want you to do is just
Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me,

Tighter
Tighter

I wanna leave you, don't wanna stay here
Don't wanna spend another day here
Though I wanna split now
I cant quit now, you really got a hold on me (you really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me (you really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me (please)
Hold me (squeeze)
Hold me, hold me
You really got a hold on me (you really got a hold on me)
I said you really got a hold on me (you really got a hold on me)
You know, you really got a hold on me
