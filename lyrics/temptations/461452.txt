Yes, I'm smiling.
Everytime you pass me by.
I know you wonder, why I never cry.


But let me tell you, happiness. (Happiness)
My happiness (Happiness)
Is just a camouflage. (Camouflage)

They call me the joker. (I'm a joker)
'Cause I... I always play.
But I'm just a clown. (I'm a clown)
'Cause I'm really not that way.

'Cause all my happiness, (Happiness)
My happiness (Happiness)
Oh, is just a camouflage.

(Open your eyes and see I'm crying)
(Open your eyes and see I'm dying)
(Open your eyes and see I'm crying)
Wee-Ooo (Hey, hey, hey)

[Instrumental]

They call me the joker. (The joker)
'Cause I... I always play.
But I'm just a clown. (I'm just a clown)
'Cause I'm really not that way.

'Cause all my happiness, (Happiness)
My happiness (Happiness)
Oh, is just a camouflage. 

(Open your eyes and see I'm crying) I love you.
(Open your eyes and see I'm dying) Oh, yes I do.

(Open your eyes and see I'm crying) Ooo, baby.
(Open your eyes and see I'm dying) Ooo, baby.

(Open your eyes and see I'm crying) I gotta broken heart.
(Open your eyes and see I'm dying) I've got a broken heart.

(Open your eyes and see I'm dying) Just a care of love.
(Open your eyes and see I'm dying) Just a care of love.

(Open your eyes and see I'm dying) I gotta broken heart.
(Open your eyes and see I'm dying) I've got a broken heart.

(Open your eyes and see I'm crying) Just a care of love.
(Open your eyes and see I'm dying) Ooo
