VERSE 1:
You got a smile so bright,
You know you could've been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could've been a handle.


The way you sweept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom.
And baby you're so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume.

CHORUS:
Well, you could've been anything that you, wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do
(the way you do the things you do)
(the way you do the things you do)

VERSE 2:
As pretty as you are,
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks was a minute,
You know that you could be an hour.

The way you stole my heart,
You know you could've been a cruel crook.
And baby you're so smart,
You know you could've been a school book.

CHORUS
(music)

You made my life so rich,
You know you could've been some money
And baby you're so sweet, (oh oh)
You know you could've been some honey.

CHORUS

you really swept me off my feet
(the way you do the things you do)
you made my life complete
(the way you do the things you do)
you made my life so bright
(the way you do the things you do)
you make me feel all right
(the way you do the things you do)
