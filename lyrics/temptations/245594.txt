You excite me everytime you speak.
When you touch me i get, oh, so weak.
I have never met a girl like you, baby.
You're the one that i'll give my whole life to.


All i wanna say is angel doll.
When i met you there with holiness.
You're my everything i must confess.
I have never known such tenderness.

Baby, you can't compare this love we share
That takes away my feels, yeah.
This love and real i can't conceal
And i'm so, so, so glad you're here.

Angel doll, it will be a great catastrophe, baby.
And my whole world would comin' down on me.
If our love would ever seize to be.
That's why i call you, angel doll.
You're the substance of my every prayer, baby.
I'll be happy with you anywhere.
Let me shield you with my loving care.

Heaven must have sent you, honey.
You're an angel in disguise, yeah.
'cause all the love i wanted so long,
I can see it in your eyes.

Angel doll, you're the reason that i carry on, baby.
I can't make it, i can't make it by myself alone.
You're the one that i'm depending upon.

Angel doll, you know that i love you.
Angel doll, i put no one above you.
Angel doll, you knock me off of my feet.
Angel doll, you make my whole life complete.
Angel doll...
