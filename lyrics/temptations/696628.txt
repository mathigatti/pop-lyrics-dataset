I watch you go to church on Sunday
But you forget all you learned on Monday
You see your smiling face can't hide
How you hate your brother inside


So Ima telling you
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)

You built this great big beautiful city
But you ran away and left it to die. What a pity.
You could have made friends with your neighbor
But you are much too prejudiced to try; tell me why!

So Ima telling you
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)

But the greatest wrong you know you've done
Is you passed this sickness onto your son
(your one and only boy)
He came into this world with a mind so clean
You took it, molded it, and made it mean!

So Ima telling you
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)
