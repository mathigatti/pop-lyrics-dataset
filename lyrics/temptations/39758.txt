Outside my window, a robin builds a nest
At last winter's gone away to rest,
Once again, the leaves have returned to the trees
I can just feel, that soft summer breeze
There's magic in the air
Winter's disappeared, it' s summer


Children will be playing, in the park...
Days will be longer, 'til dark
Nights will be long,
The star-filled skies...
A perfect setting,
For a girl and a guy
There's magic in the air,
Green grass everywhere, it's summer

Lovers, will walk the beach hand in hand...
While others, build castles in the sand

Now that summer's here,
There'll be millions of things to do.
Vacation here or at a farm
Whatever pleases you

Summer, is the happiest season of them all...
So everybody, get together and have yourself a ball
There's magic in the air,
Green grass everywhere, it's summer
