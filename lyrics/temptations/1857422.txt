Who took your love away
Who made you cry that day
What kind of fool would steal a heart
Then turn and lie
Well, I know one thing is true
This I can say to you
Cause I am the one who's here
To take your pain away
You gave all you had and a few cents more
He turned his back and he's walking out the door
But that's alright, it's alright go on and let him go


Cause I'm here
I'm here to show you love
Like you've never know
Whit all my heart, my mind
My body and soul
I'm here to show you love
Here to show your love
That you never knew
Would cause you to want someone
As much as they want you

Just let me lay whith you
I promise I'll stay whit you
Cause what kind of fool would let
The prize of your die
And since he neglected you
Kept on forgetting you
Had your wants, your needs, your desires to fulfill
You don't have to feel guilty now
Cause this is the place and this is how
I'll help you face the fact that you deserve much more

Cause I'm here
I'm here to show you love
Like you've never know
Whit all my heart, my mind
My body and soul
I'm here to show you love
Here to show your love
That you never knew
Would cause you to want someone
As much as they want you

He never should've left you alone
You need a love in your life
So baby girl, let it go
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Cause I'm here


Cause I'm here
I'm here to show you love
Like you've never know
Whit all my heart, my mind
My body and soul
I'm here to show you love
Here to show your love
That you never knew
Would cause you to want someone
As much as they want you
