Someday, somewhere We'll find a new way of living Will find a way of forgiving Somewhere... 
There's a place for us Somewhere a place for us Peace and quiet and open air 
Wait for us Somewhere There's a time for us 
Someday there'll time for us Time together and time to spare Time to learn, time to care Someday, somewhere We'll find a new way of living Will find there's a way of forgiving Somewhere... There's a place for us A time and place for us Hold my hand and we're half way there Hold my hand and I'll take you there Somehow... Someday, somewhere...
