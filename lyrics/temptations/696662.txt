I Ain't got time to think about money,
Or what it can buy (ah ah ah ah)
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder,
At what makes a birdie fly (ah ah ah ah)


I dont have time to think about what
Makes a flower grow
And I never given a thought
To where rivers flow

(Too Busy Thinking about my baby)
O Yeah,
Aint got time for nothing else

I Ain't got time to discuss the weather,
Or how long its gonna last (ah ah ah ah)
And I ain't got time to do no studying,
Once I get out of class (ah ah ah ah)

And Im just a fella,
With a one, a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about,
anything but my baby,
I just dont have time!

(Too Busy Thinking about my baby)
O Yeah,
Aint got time for nothing else

And I know it's all, Its alright
(Instrumental)

I Ain't got time to read a newspaper,
Or look at TV (ah ah ah ah)
Cause' I'm not concerned with what the future holds,
Instore for me (ah ah ah ah)

Im just a fella,
With a one, a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about,
anything but my baby,
I just dont have time!

(Too Busy Thinking about my baby)
O Yeah,
Aint got time for nothing else

You know I'm too, too busy
(Too Busy Thinking about my baby)
O Yeah,
Aint got time for nothing else (Fades out)
