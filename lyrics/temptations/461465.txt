There's a train leaving here tomorrow. (Leaving here)
And I'll be a free, free man once again. (A free man)


I'm so glad I served my time, I'm gonna meet the girl that I left behind.
And when I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got.
Ooo, when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got.

There were times, there were times when each day seems like a year.
But the sweet things she said in her letters, made the times disappear, oh yeah.
She said, No one's arms will I let hold me 'cause in your arms is where I want to be.

So when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got.
Ooo, when I see her... (I'm gonna give her all) all the love I've got.

Ooo, baby, baby, baby, I miss you so. Ugh!
Hmmm (Aw)

Countless nights I stared out my window at the moonlight, yes I did now.
Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight, oh yeah.
I must've been out of my mind to do the wrong I did and leave her behind.

So when I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got.
Woo, when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got.
Believe me when I tell ya
When I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got.
