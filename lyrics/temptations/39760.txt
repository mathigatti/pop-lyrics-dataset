Oh oh oh.
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by,
I say to myself you're such a lucky guy,
To have a girl like her,
Is truly a dream come true,
Out of all the fellas in the world,
She belongs to me.


But it was just my imagination
Running away with me,
It was just my imagination
Running away with me.

oh,ho,ho,ho

(Soon) soon we'll be married,
And raise a family, (oh yeah)
A cosy little home out in the country,
With 2 children, maybe 3.
I tell you I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems.

But it was just my imagination,once again
Running away with me,
Tell you It was just my imagination
Running away with me.

Every night on my knees I pray,
Dear Lord, hear my plead,
Don't ever let another take her love from me,
Or I will surely die,
Her Love is heavenly
When her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody,
But in reality
She doesn't even notice me

Just my imagination once again,
Running away with me, ohhhh,
Tell me It was just my imagination
Running away with me.
