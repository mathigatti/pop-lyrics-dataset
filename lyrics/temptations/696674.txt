One Day, You will be cared to realize
by the look that's in my eyes


[Chorus:]
How much I love you
(Love you)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

Somehow, these arms of mine cant let you go
The touch of my hand baby should let you know

[Chorus]

We go together like hand and glove
[Melvin:] Don't Destroy our precious love...
Somehow these arms of mine cant let you go
the touch of my hand should let you know

[Chorus]
