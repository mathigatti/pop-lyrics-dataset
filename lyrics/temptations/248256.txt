(please return your love to me, girl)
(forgive me for the wrong i've done)


And, oh, baby
I cry myself to sleep at night
For fear of a-never holdin' you tight at all, baby (whoa, baby)
I miss ya more with each passin' day
Every night on my knees i pray
Oh, oh, baby (please)

Chorus
(return your love to me, girl)
(forgive me for the wrong i've done
(without your love, i'm just no good)
(for i am just a lonely boy)

I'm sorry for the wrong i've done
Now i know how it feels to lose that special someone (whoa, baby)
I need you more than words can say
Without your love i can't face another day
Oh, (please)

(return your love to me, girl)
(forgive me for the wrong i've done
(without your love, i'm just no good)
(i am just a lonely one)

Oh, no, no-o-o-o, babe

If there's a heav'n above you'll be my one and only love (and, oh, baby)
I can't control the glow in me
Girl, come on and an' see about me

(oh, ple-ea-ease)

(return your love to me, girl)
(forgive me for the wrong i've done
(without your love, i'm just no good)
(i am just a lonely one)

I'm a lonely one
I'm a lonely one
I'm a lonely one
I'm just a lonely one (i am just a)

Fade
(please, return your love to me, girl)
(forgive me for the wrong i've done
(without your love, i'm just no good)
(i am just a lonely one)
