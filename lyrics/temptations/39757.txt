Temptations: Kumba ya-ya
Oh my soul, of my whole ya-ya-ya
Price so right, my whole ya-ya-ya


Born into this world a baby,
You're mind is clear as the air
Time passes...
You learn to walk and talk
Time passes...
You learn right from wrong
Time passes...
You leave home seeking a life
Of your own...

I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
Listen to me people...
You make your own heavens and hell
Right here on earth

I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
You make you own heaven and hell
Right here on earth
On earth, on earth, on earth...

Time passess...
And your values change
Life becomes a strange, confusing game
Suddenly you want the finer things in life
But you find it takes a lots of hard work
Now you're standing
At the crossroads of life
To satisfy your personal wants...
Will you do wrong
Or will you do right?
Well one thing you must admit,
And you know it's true
The final decision,
Is still up to you

I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
Listen to me people...
You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth
Let me tell you one more time...
I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth

Listen people...
Life is a giant, invisible scale with two sides;
Good and bad
You and your beliefs
Are the weights
The things you do each day
Determine the balance
Your conscience is a flawless
Judge and jury;
The only question is what you want

I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth
One more time, now listen...
I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world

You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth

Temptations repeat above chorus starting with
I'm tellin you...etc,  to the end of song.
