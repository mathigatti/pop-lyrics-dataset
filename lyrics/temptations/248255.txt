I love you, girl, with all my heart &amp; soul
I can't understand why you treat me cold
Your every wish, girl, is my command
&amp; that's why i can't seem to understand why
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?


One day you say you love me too
The next day you tell me that we are through
My love for you is just a game
But each time we play, girl, my heart feels the pain
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
Oh girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue, so blue?
(instrumental)

Woo girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue? (make me blue)
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl, tell me why can't you be true? (can't be true)
The way you treat me, it just isn't fair
You make it so plain you just don't care
You have a ball around my time
Of sleepless nights i'm getting tired
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue, baby?
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
Oh oh girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
