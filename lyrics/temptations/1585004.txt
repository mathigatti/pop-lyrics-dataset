Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi

When you're on the top
There's no place you can
really go but down, down, down


People on the street congratulate you
They say they love the way you sound, well

When you're on the low
No one wants to chit
or chat or even know your name

Your agent's never there
Your manager has
ripped you off and gone somewhere

Standing on the top!

Standing on the top (top)
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top (Yeah), top
On the top getting down

Temptations sing!

Standing on the top, top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Standing on the top, top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

When you're on the top
Everyone you meet
they wanna be your long lost friend

They say how great you are, a superstar
But do you have any money to lend
(Hey, man, can you loan me a few bucks)

When you're on the low
Where do all the freaks
and fancy people go, [I don't know] I don't know

People sit and stare
Askin' crazy questions,
"Do you braid your hair"
and "What's L-7 Square"

Standing on the top (top)
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top (Yeah), top
On the top getting down

Hey...hoo

Standing on the top (top)
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top, top
On the top getting down, down, down, down

Standing on the top (Sing)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Well, well, well, well, well, well)
Standing on the top (Well)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Standing on the top getting down)

Can you understand it [We understand it]
Can you understand it what I'm talkin' about
When I say that funk is here to stay [We understand it]
Can you understand it what I'm talkin' about
That funk is here to stay, oh [We understand it]
If you understand it say, "Yeah" {Yeah...yeah...}

We want the funk
We want the funk and nothing else [We want the funk]
We want the funk and nothing else will do

We want the funk
We want the funk and nothing else [We want the funk]
We want the funk and nothing else will do

We want the funk
We want the funk and nothing else [We want the funk]
We want the funk and nothing else will do

We want the funk
We want the funk and nothing else [We want the funk]
