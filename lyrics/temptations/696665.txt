What a diff'rence a day makes Twenty-four little hours Brought the sun and the flowers 
Where there used to be rain 
My yesterday was blue, dear Today I'm part of you, dear 


My lonely nights are through, dear Since you said you were mine What a diff'rence a day makes There's a rainbow before me Skies above can't be stormy Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss It's heaven when you Find romance on your menu What a diff'rence a day makes And the difference is you What a diff'rence a day makes There's a rainbow before me Skies above can't be stormy Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss It's heaven when you Find 
romance on your menu What a diff'rence a day makes And the difference is you.
