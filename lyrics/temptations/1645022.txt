Feather in your cap if you catch a robber,
Dirt in your face if your scheme falls through
Pay close attention to my story
You'll find every word is true.


Junk man standing on the corner
Selling death, no conscience has he.
In the name of God, wont somebody stop him
stop him, think about the children
Its a matter of life and death, you see.

Ain't no time to stand back and point your finger,
We've got to face reality.
No, no, no, no, no...
Don't turn your back on this problem, people,
too much depends on you and me.

Desperate with no sense of value,
just an evil mind lurking through the night.
Because of you, the streets ain't safe no more for walking,
cause you're feeling so up-tight.

Take a look around, are you afraid?
Take a look around, don`t be afraid.
Take a look around, are you afraid?
Take a look around, don`t be afraid.
Take a look around, are you afraid?
Take a look around, don`t be afraid.
