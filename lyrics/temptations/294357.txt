People gather round me... This is to who it may concern
I'm not tryin' to run your life but you're never too old to learn
Stop worryin' about your neighbors and the fancy things they got
'Cause if you do you'll find it's true, you're gonna wind up on the spot


Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down
Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down

You may not believe it but nine times out of ten it's true
The people you're tryin' to keep up with are tryin' to keep up too
Remember that old sayin'; "All that glitters ain't gold"
Take heed, don't ignore it, and to your money tightly hold

Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down
Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down

You're a leader yourself but you don't even know it
You're so busy followin' Joneses you ain't got time to show it
Keeping up with the Joneses, it only makes your life a mess
Bill collectors, tranquilizers and gettin' deeper in debt

You better leave the Joneses alone
You better leave ---oh leave--- the Joneses alone

Joneses got a new car today
Here's what you should say; Hooray for the Joneses
Instead you worry 'til your whole head turns gray
Worryin' about the Joneses
Remember it's their car and they're the ones who had to pay
So leave (boom boom) the Joneses alone
Your car might be old but, remember; It never fails to get you where you want to go

Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down
Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down

You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind

If you see somethin' you want and you know you can't afford it
Well the very next thing for you to do is start saving towards it
The Joneses have been the downfall of many a person you see
So, people, take my advice and let the Joneses be

Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down
Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down

You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind
You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind
