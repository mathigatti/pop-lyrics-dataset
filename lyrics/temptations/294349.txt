Ain't no mountain high



Listen baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby


If you need me call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Don't worry baby
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't need to worry

'Cause baby there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby

Remember the day
I set you free
I told you, you could always count on me, darlin'
( Yeah baby )
From that day on
I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Someway
Some how

'Cause baby there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby

No wind
No rain

Or winter's cold
Can stop me, baby
Oooh no..
'Cause you are my goal
If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me
Oooh baby

My love is alive
Deep down in my heart
Although we are miles apart

If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can

Don't you no that there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you baby

Don't you no that there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you baby
