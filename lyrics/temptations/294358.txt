If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place.
(You can't run it, you can't hide it, you can't run it)
Love has problems I know but there problems, we'll just have to face.
Oh yeah, yeah.
If you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
We're gonna walk and don't look back. (Don't look back)
And don't look back. Oh yeah, yeah.
And don't look back, baby. (Don't look back)
(The places behind you let them re-remind you.)
If your first lover broke your heart,
There's something that can be done.
(You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it)
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on walking and don't look back.
Forget about the past now.
Don't look back, baby.
Keep on walking and don't look back. Hmmm
(The places behind you let them re-remind you.)
[Instrumental]
Love can be a beautiful thing.
Though your first love let you down.
Oh yeah, yeah
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby.
The second time around.
Oh yeah, yeah
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on pushing and don't look back.
Now, till I say, we won't look back, girl.
Keep on walking and won't look back.
Forget about the past now, baby.
And don't look back.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't look back.
