Oooooooooooooooh!
Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else


In and out my life(in and out my life)
You come and you go(you come and you go)
Leaving just your picture behind....(ooh)
And I've kissed it a thousand times(ooh)
When you snap your finger, or wink you eye,
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings,
And there's nothing that I can do

I can't help myself,
No, I can't help myself,

'Cause, Sugar Pie Honey Bunch
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself 
I'm a fool in love 'ya see

Wanna tell you I don't love you,
Tell you that we're through
And I try....
But ev'ry time I see your face,
I get all choked up inside
When I call your name,
Girl, it starts to flame
Burning in my heart,
Tearing it all apart..
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide....

'Cause Sugar Pie Honey Bunch
You know that I'm waiting for you(waiting for you)
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

Sugar Pie Honey Bunch
I'd do anything you ask me to(ask me to)
I can't help myself
I want you and nobody else

Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch
You know that I love you(I dooo)
I can't help myself...
No... I can't help myself
