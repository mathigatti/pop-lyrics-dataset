I don't care where you came from.
Oh no, I don't care where you've been.
All I know, is that I love you.
And I'm going to love you till the end. (Gonna love you until the end)


'Cause you're my... (Dream come true.)
You're my... (Dream come true.)
You're my... (Dream come true.)
And I love you better than anyone before.

For every hand there's a glove.
For every, for every heart there should be love.
Yes, I've been waiting for such a long, long time.
Don't worry, nobody, nobody is gonna change my mind. (Nobody's gonna change my mind)

'Cause you're my... (Dream come true.)
You're my... (Dream come true.)
You're my... (Dream come true.)
And I love you better than anyone before.

[Instrumental]

Yes, you're my...(Dream come true.)
You're my... (Dream come true.)
You're my... (Dream come true.)
And I love you better than anyone before.

(Better than anyone, better than anyone...)

I love you (Better than anyone)
Than anyone before. (Better than anyone before) 
A-Do me right because I love you. (Better than anyone)
Keep coming 'cause I love you. (Better than anyone)
