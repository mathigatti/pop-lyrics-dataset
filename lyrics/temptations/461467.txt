I bet you're wondering how I knew.
Ah, what you're plans to make me blue.
With some other guy you knew before. 
Between the two of us, you know I love you more.


Dennis:

Oh, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)
Not much longer would you be mine. (Not much longer would you be mine)
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine) 
And I'm just about to lose my mind. 

I know a man ain't supposed to cry.
But these tears I can't hold inside.
Losin' you would end my life you see.
'Cause you mean that much to me.

Eddie:

Oh, that you love someone else.
Instead I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)
Not much longer would you be mine. (Not much longer would you be mine)
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine) 
Oh, and I am, and I am just about lose my mind.

Ah, boom, boom, boom,...(ect.)

Dennis:
People say believe half of what you see.
Oh, and none of what you hear.
Whoa, I jus' can't help being confused.
If it's true please tell me dear.
