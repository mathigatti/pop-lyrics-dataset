Into my life you bought a glowin love,
like a ray of sunshine from up above, ha
One day out of the clear blue sky, 
You darkened my world with the words good-bye. 
That's the day you left me for a stranger yeah baby baby 
When you left my life you've gone an you changed ah....baby I'm a tellin' you it Ain't no sun since you been gone....Ooo ooo....


Theres a big black cloud hanging over my head,
its a cloud of lonliness and I feel like I'm dead, Ha! 
Ain't no flowers bloomin' down at the shore
Since you chose to love me no more. 
I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me baby ya did,
Girl ya took the light from my world crushed my dreams and I don't mean maybe, yeah

An imma tellin' you there 
Ain't no sun since you been gone gone gone gone gone

My future, my future was as bright as the sun yes it was 
I aint got no future now that your gone.
ooooo, oooo

Ahh I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me baby, (took away my sunshine)
Girl you took the light from my world (took away my sunshine)
Crushed my dreams and I don't mean maybe 

Aww baby it seems like night in the middle of the day
everything around me is faded and grey. 
Cold are the days Dark creeps the night
Never bringing you back into my life
And there ain't no sun since you been gone gone gone gone gone

(Ain't no sun since you been gone)
its just a dark lonely world without you girl.....(fade)
