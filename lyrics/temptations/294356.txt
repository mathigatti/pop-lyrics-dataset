Hmm, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
You don't have to tell me you've gone to found someone new.
'cause i can feel his presence, whenever i'm-a kissing you.
How can you ask me to try, try and understand
Well, just put yourself in my place.
Go on, just see if you can.
I'm-a begging you. (don't, don't you let him)
Baby, please. (don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
I'm begging you, baby. (don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
So what if he whispers how much he loves you in your ear.
But pay no mind 'cause i love you much more my dear, huh.
My love are like mountains.
That's how strong it is for you.
If you ever walk away in to his arms
Which will surely break my heart in two.
I'm begging you. (don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Baby, baby, i'm begging. (don't, don't you let him)
No, no, no, no. (don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Oh, i couldn't stand it, baby.
[instrumental]
If you leave me for him you would truly be unfair.
Now, just ask yourself, whenever you needed me, wasn't i always there
Now, i'm begging you, baby, baby, down on my bended knees.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, please stay here with me.
Baby, please. (don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Baby, baby, please. (don't, don't you let him)
I couldn't stand it. (don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
I ain't too proud to beg. (don't, don't you let him)
