I saw the saddest thing, other day.
When an old man pass my way.
Walking the streets so all alone.
All because he had no home.
But the saddest thing i've ever seen,
Is a tear from a woman's eye.
A tear from a woman's eye.
Hmmm
I saw a man, no shoes on his feet.
But the saddest thing is to see a woman weep.
A woman is tender thing.
To see her cry, a sad, sad thing.
Nothing touches me deeper inside,
Than a tear from a woman's eye.
A tear from a woman's eye.
Hmmm
[instrumental - humming]
A woman's tears dropping on her cheek,
Is like a sound of thunder, that loudly it rings.
'cause when i see her cry, i know she hurts inside.
Yes, the saddest thing i've ever seen.
Is a tear from a woman's eye.
A tear from a woman's eye.
Hmmm
Sad, sad thing is a tear from a woman's eye.
A sad, sad thing is to see a woman cry.
Sad, sad, sad thing is a tear from a woman's eye.
Sad, sad, sad thing is to see a woman cry.
