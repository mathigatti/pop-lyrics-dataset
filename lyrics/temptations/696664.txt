I've got a lover way over ther, on the mountain side and i know that's where i should be

don't you know i've got a lover way over there across the river wide and i can hear her calling to me

she's calling my name, so sweet and so plain and i can hear her saying

come to me baby
i'm on my way
come to me baby
i'm gonna stay
come to me baby


they tell me that the river's to deep and it's much to wide for you can't get across to the other side

but they don't know i got to get there and hold her in my arms just one more time like a did before when she mine all mine, cause i can hear her saying

come to me baby
i'm on my way
come to me baby
i'm gonna stay
come to me baby
i'm gonna get to you
come to me baby
no matter what i have to do
come to me baby

they tell me that the river's to deep and it's much to wide for you can't make it over to the other side

but they don't know i got to get there and hold her in my arms just one more time like a did before when she mine all mine, cause i can hear her saying

come to me baby
i'm on my way
come to me baby
i'm gonna stay
come to me baby
ooh, baby when i get there, i ain't going nowhere, because a river in't deep enough, a mountain ain't steap enough to keep me from your side
