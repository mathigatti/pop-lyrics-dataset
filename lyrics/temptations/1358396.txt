Oh, Holy Night
The stars 
Are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear 
Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin 
And error pining
'Til He appeared 
And the soul felt
It's worth a thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new 
And glorious morn
Fall on your knees 
Oh, hear the angel voices


Oh, night divine
Oh, night 
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine 
Oh night
Oh, Holy night 
Fall on your knees 
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine 
Oh, night 
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine 
Oh, night
Oh, Holy night 

Oh, night divine
Oh, night 
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine 
Oh night
Oh, Holy night 
Fall on your knees 
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine 
Oh, night 
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine 
Oh, night
Oh, Holy night
