No more one night stands
And broken promises
Tired of all the giving
And you never receive

And I'll give you everything, everything you need

To think about it baby
'Cause you been hurt so many times
And you're really, really scared

And I'll give everything, everything you need
Everything you need...'Cause you are

And I know you heart's been broken many times

t let's take the time, and try and wotks things out
'Cause I know just what you need,and it's me...
