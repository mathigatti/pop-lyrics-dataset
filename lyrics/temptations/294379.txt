Each day you've got someone new
A new heart to break
And leave feeling blue
For you're a handsome guy
Girls just can't pass you by
But I can, my friend
I'm the exception to the rule
I know you think I'm just acting the part
Of the girl with the cold, cold heart
And it won't take long
For you to capture me
With your innocent but meaningful plea
But you won't capture me
I'm the exception to the rule
You tell me
Darling that's where you're wrong
That your love for me is oh so strong
That you will soon, very soon
Make me give in
I know that nine girls out of every ten
Wants you to be their man
But there I am again
That one in ten
So it's useless
For you to try and change me
Because I won't give in, my friend
You could fool all the girls
With your lies
About you being so sweet and kind
But oh no, not me
I'm the exception to the rule
Give it up
I'm the one you can't fool
I'm the one
I'm the exception to the rule
Give it up
I'm the one you can't fool
I'm the one
The exception to the rule
Give it up
I'm the one you can't fool
I'm the one
I'm the one you can't fool
