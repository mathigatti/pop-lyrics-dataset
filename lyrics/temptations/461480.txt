It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember (yes I will)
'cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth


Mama just hung her head and said: Son,

Papa was a rollin' stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died,
All he left us was alone

Hey Mama,
Is it true, what they say that Papa never worked a day in his life?

And Mama,
Some bad talk goin' round town say that Papa had three young, sad children and another wife
And that ain't right!

Heard some talk about Papa doin' some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about savin' souls, and all the time leechin'
Dealin' in naught
And stealing in the name of the Lord

Mama just hung her head and said:

Papa was a rollin' stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died,
All he left us was alone

Hey Mama,
I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal to pay his bills

Hey Mama,
Folks say Papa was never much on thinkin'
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!

Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth

Mama looked up with a tear in her eye and said:

Papa was a rollin' stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died,
All he left us was alone
