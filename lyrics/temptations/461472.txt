Got myself an angel.
Straight from the heavens above.
And I'm truly, truly thankful (Thankful)
For having such a heavenly love.


Just standing she's got it. (Tell the world about it)
Found a four leaf clover. (You put all over)
And I love her. (And I love her)
Listen to me now, she's in love with me.

I got a girl, won't trade her for the world.
'Cause nothing can match what she's worth.
She's sweet as can be and she's crazy about me.
I've got heaven right here on earth.

She's got eyes, that sparkle like diamonds, yeah.
Listen to me, she's got a heart.
Talkin' about her heart, that's made of pure gold.

Woo
She's sugar and spice, baby. (Everything nice)
Peaches and cream. (The little, little things)
And I love her. (And I love her)
I want to tell you that, she's in love with me.

I got a girl, won't trade her for the world.
'Cause nothing can match what she's worth.
She's sweet as can be and she's crazy about me.
I've got heaven right here on earth.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye-ye-ye-yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye-ye-ye-yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye-ye-ye-yeah)

Whenever we go steppin' out.
I can't tell you how proud I feel.
Her beauty so passes for Mona Lisa.
Sometimes I can't believe she's here.

She's a living dream. (She's my protection) 
From lonely night nights. (She's my protection)
And I love her. (And I love her)
Listen to me, she's in love with me.

Let me tell you, 'bout girl won't trade her for the world.
'Cause nothing can match what she's worth.
She's sweet as can be and she's crazy about me.
I've got heaven right here on earth.

Listen to me now, I got a girl won't trade her for the world.
Listen, nothing can match what she's worth.
