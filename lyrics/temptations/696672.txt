There were times I knew
But I found it hard to say
You were special in my life
Never thought youd go away


I'll be strong
I'll get by
Without you in my life
I can see
Through your lies
Did you ever love me
I never found your love

You and I know
Love is leaving
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I
Even try

You and I know
Love is leaving
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else
I will find
A memory I've left behind

If I ever made you cry
Any reason I can't find
It was lonely by your side
Like a fool, I stood by you
I'll be strong
I'll get by
Without you in my life
I can see
Through your lies
Did you ever love me
I never found your love

You and I know
Love is leaving
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I
Even try

You and I know
Love is leaving
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else
I will find
A memory I've left behind

Is there something I could do
Is there something I should say
Is there someone else to keep you from
And now (Woah, woah, yeah, yeah yeah-yeah-yeah)

You and I know
Love is leaving
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I
Even try

You and I know
Love is leaving
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else
I will find
A memory I've left behind

You and I know
Love is leaving
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I
Even try

You and I know
Love is leaving
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Why should I
Even try
