Well, Lord have mercy
Well, Lord have mercy
This ain't no good for me
This ain't no good for me, babe
Well, Lord have mercy
Well, Lord have mercy
Ain't no good for me, babe
Tell me what's goin' down, babe


Every time I wanna say it, it is
Just too much for me
I don't ever wanna say it cause of
All the blasphemy
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love
In sight of me
I might tell on you
Don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's got kids with
your mother in law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother, she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm lookin' right at you
Stop it, it's too much
Monkey business goin' down

Well, Lord have mercy
Well, Lord have mercy
Don't be callin' out "mercy me" (Don't be callin' out "mercy me")
Don't be callin' down, babe (Don't be callin' out mercy)
Well, Lord have mercy
Even burst the breast
Don't be callin' out "mercy me" (Don't be callin' out "mercy me")
Don't be goin' down, babe (Don't be callin' out "mercy")

Every time I wanna say it, it is
Just too much for me
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love
It seems to me
I just can't believe the things I'm seein'
So just let it be
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's got kids with
your mother in law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother, she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm lookin' right at you
Stop it, it's too much
Monkey business goin' down

I read the paper and I can't believe what's goin' round
Somebody's doin' it to somebody's up, somebody's down
The government won't pay my taxes and I'm really mad
My mouth might let it be
So don't you monkey shy with me

Your brother's got kids with
your mother in law
I might drop dead about what I saw

I caught your mother, she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm lookin' right at you
Your brother's gone and kissed
The mother in law
I might tell Dad about what I saw
Your brother didn't make a nickle, or dime too
Sittin' around tellin' how he did it to you
Stop it, it's too much
Monkey business goin' down

(Monkey business goin' down)
(Monkey business goin' down)
(Monkey business goin' down)
(Monkey business goin' down)

(Monkey business goin' down)
(Monkey business goin' down)
(Monkey business goin' down)
(Monkey business goin' down)
