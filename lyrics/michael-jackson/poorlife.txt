People got a new obsession
Talking' about a new recession
Ain't nothin' change, it's still the same, where it comes from
Mama had to cook and clean
Daddy had to learn to read
To get a good job, he did what he do
Mama scrubbed on her knees til they're famous, not blue


We don't need much to make us feel blessed
We've been living like this, our whole life
We living a poor life

Why is it that everytime i see some
One complaining bout' how there life is going
Think about how they got so good
And wouldn't last one minute out in the hood

We living' good and not live in stress
We don't need much to make us feel blessed
We've been living like this, our whole life
We living a poor life

So when you start to lose your grip, we know what it feels like
If we lived daddy's life, do you think that you might
You here for what you give, cause you know that it feels right
Change your life

We living' good and not live in stress
We don't need much to make us feel blessed
We've been living like this, our whole life
We living a poor life
We living' good and not live in stress
We don't need much to make us feel blessed
We've been living like this, our whole life
We living a poor life
