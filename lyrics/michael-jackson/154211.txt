Lisa, it's your birthday
And God bless you this day
You gave me the gift
Of a little sister
And I'm proud of you today


(Chorus)
Lisa, it's your birthday
Happy Birthday Lisa
Lisa, it's your birthday
Happy Birthday Lisa

I wish you love
And goodwill
I wish you praise and joy
I wish you better
Than your heart desires
And your first kiss
From a boy

Lisa, it's your birthday
Happy Birthday Lisa
Lisa, it's your birthday
Happy Birthday Lisa

Yeah

(Chorus 2x)
