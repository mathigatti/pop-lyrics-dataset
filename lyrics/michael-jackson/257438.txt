Chorus:
Gotta find a way somehow
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Gotta find a way somehow
Even though you're gone


Things don't look as bad
As they did yesterday
Even minute I get
Stronger somehow...some way
Cause I gotta keep on living
I got the will to survive
Even though I feel so bad
So bad inside

Chorus:
Gotta find a way somehow
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Gotta find a way somehow
Even though you're gone

All the plans I had
I've got to give them up
And start anew
Making plans for one
Instead of making plans for two
From now on I'll be thinkin
Thinking 'bout myself
It'll be a long time
Before I love somebody else

[Chorus]

I depended on you
For everything
Oh, I really trusted you
How could you do me the
Way you did
You really let me down

[Chorus]
