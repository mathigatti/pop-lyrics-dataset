Sister don't read so she'll never know
What about love? Living a Christian soul
What do we get, she runs away
What about love? What about all I pray?


Don't know the words
She knows the beat
What about God? Living is all I see
What do you get, things she would say
What about love? That's all I pray

Those abortion papers
Signing your name against the word of god
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I'd like to have my child

Sister confused, she went alone
What about love? What about all I saw?
Biding her time, reading the words
Singing a song, reciting a bible verse

All those confused, a mothers despair
Brothers encourage, what about all I see?
You know they die, you came along
What about heart? That's all I know

Those abortion papers
Signing your name against the word of god
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I'd like to have my child

Those abortion papers (Aow!)
Signing your name against the word of god
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I'd like to have my child

Look at my word, what do they say?
Look at my heart burning is all I pray
What do you care? What do you say?
What about love? To feel my sin

Those abortion papers
Signing your name against the word of god
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I'd like to have my child

Those abortion paper (Aow!)
Think about life, I'd like to have my child (Aow!)

(Aow!)

Sister don't know, where would she go?
What about love? What about all I know?

What will you get, end up confused
Love only say, It's just the things I do

Those abortion papers
Signing your name against the word of god
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I'd like to have my child

Those abortion papers (abortion paper)
(This paper) (Hee-Hee)
Those abortion papers (Hee Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
I'd like to have my child (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)

Those abortion papers (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
(Hee Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
Those abortion papers (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
I'd like to have my child (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)

Those abortion papers (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
