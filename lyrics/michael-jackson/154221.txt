Refrain
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way


Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share

Refrain
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

In despair we'll be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough

Refrain
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
Love is all we need

Refrain
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way
