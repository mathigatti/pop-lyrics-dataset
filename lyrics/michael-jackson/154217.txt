You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there
(I'll be there)


I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)

And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you

I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
(Holding on, holding on, holding on)
Yes I will, yes I will

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, well that's all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
(I'll be there)

I'll be there to protect you (Yeah baby)
With an unselfish love I respect you
Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)

And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you

I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
(Holding on, holding on, holding on)
Yes I will, yes I will

If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
Cause if he doesn't, I'll be there
(I'll be there)

Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
(I'll be there)

Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh
I'll be there, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
(I'll be there)

Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
