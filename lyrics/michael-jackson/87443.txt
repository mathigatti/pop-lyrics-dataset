If I could tear down these walls
That keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart
And our perfect love will start
But girl you just won't approve
Of the things that I do
When all I do is for you
But still you say it ain't cool


If there's somebody else
(He can't love you like me)
And he says he'll treat you well
(He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls
(He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world
(He can't trick you like me)

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now many times I've told you
Of all the things I would do
But I cant seem to get through
No matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem
That you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be
More than you could ever dream

If there's somebody else
(He can't love you like me)
And he says he'll treat you well
(He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls
(He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world
(He can't trick you like me)

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now some way I'll have to prove
All that I said I would do
Giving you everything
Fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind
And finally give in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men
Are supposed to do for you my baby

Yo, mummy stop the refrain, I'm real with mine
All the things that I promise, I'll fulfill in time
The chains and the bracelet got the realest shine (bling)
So many trips she had jetlag, and still be fine (Come on now)
He can trick, but his money ain't long enough
He can spend, but his game ain't strong enough
Now, the way you resisting, this ain't cool It's like nothing seems to worry, she's Invincible

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

She's invincible
She's invincible
She's invincible
She's invincible

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
