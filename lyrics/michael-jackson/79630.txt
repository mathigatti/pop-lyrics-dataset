She got your number
She know your game
She put you under
It's so insane


Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill

Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it

Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world
I got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love
And true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
And Susie says it's right

She got your number
How does it feel
To know the stranger
Is out to kill

She got your baby
It happened fast
If you could only erase the past

Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it

Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world
I got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love
And true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
And Susie says it's right

Susie got your number
Susie ain't your friend
(It's going down, baby)
Look who took you under
She stuck seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
(It's going down, baby)
Susie got your number
You know Susie says it's right

It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it
