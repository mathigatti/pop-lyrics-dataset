We're on a mission
In the everlasting light that shines
A revelation
Of the truth in chapters of our minds


So long, bad times
We're gonna shake it up and break it up
We're sharing light brighter than the sun
Hello , good times
We're here to simulate, eliminate
An' congregate, illuminate

(We are here to change the world)
Gonna change the world, Hee
(We are here to change the world)
Gonna change the world, Ooo

So do surrender
'Cause the power's deep inside my soul
Sing it

(We are here to change the world)
Gonna change the world, Sing it
(We are here to change the world)
Hee, Gonna change the world, Ooo

(We are here to change the world)
We're gonna change the world, girl
(We are here to change the world)
My brothers my brother Na
We're gonna change the world
(We are here to change the world)
Hee, Deep down in my body,
deep down in my soul, Baby
(We are here to change the world)
Hee, We're gonna change the world,
Ooo
