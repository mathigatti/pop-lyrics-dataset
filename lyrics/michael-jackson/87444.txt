Hold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine
You and me, makin' love all the way through another night
I remember you and I walking though the park at night
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go


Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
People talk, people say what we have is just a game
Oh, I'll never let you go
Come here girl, just got to make sweet love

'Til the break of dawn (I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love)
Break of dawn (Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart)
Break of dawn (I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you)
Break of dawn (I won't stop 'til break of dawn makin' love)

Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes you've got me nervous yet
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
There's imagination I bet you've never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you've never know

(Break of dawn) There's no sun up in the sky
(Break of dawn) I can see it in your eyes
(Break of dawn) Girl you got to understand
It's the way that I love you, let me show you I'm your man

Break of dawn (I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love)
Is the break of dawn (Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart)
Is the break of dawn (I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you)
Dawn (I won't stop 'til break of dawn makin' love)

Is the break of dawn (I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love)
Is the break of dawn (Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart)
Is the break of dawn (I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you)
Break of dawn (I won't stop 'til break of dawn makin' love)

Let's not wait, the sun is out, let's get up and let's get out
It's the day, a brand new day, let's both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, makin' love 'til it's dark
Let me move, let me soothe, 'til the break of dawn and you know it's true, oh

(I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love)
Break of dawn (Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart)
Is the break of dawn (I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you)
(I won't stop 'til break of dawn makin' love)

(I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love)
(Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart)
Is the break of dawn (I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you)
Is the break of dawn (I won't stop 'til break of dawn makin' love)

(I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love)
Is the break of dawn (Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart)
(I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you)
Break of dawn (I won't stop 'til break of dawn makin' love)
