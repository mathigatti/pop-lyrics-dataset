Girl, I love you
And I apologize
Still I don't know the reason
So I, so I can't tell you why
I hurt the one I love
Made you cry
And girl, I know that I messed up
That it hurts me so deep inside
Well, oh I wish I could go back in time
So I could fix up my mistake
Make everything alright
Girl, I know just what is on your mind
Couldn't blame if you hated me
For the rest of my life


Ooh, baby I
Didn't mean to hurt you
To make you cry
Oh girl, you know I really love you
And it hurts me deep inside
To know that the person that just hurt you
And made you cry
Is one who really, really loves you
And it hurts me deep inside
How could I hurt the one I love

Girl, I'm sorry
And I do realize
That things will never be the same
No matter how hard I try
'Cos I
Hurt the one I love
How could I let you down
And there's no other reason
Why you, why you just on the ground
Well, oh I wish I could go back in time
So I could fix up my mistake
Make everything alright
And girl, I know just what is on your mind
Couldn't blame if you hated me
For the rest of my life

Oh, baby I
Didn't mean to hurt you
To make you cry
(to make you cry, girl)
Oh girl, you know I really love you
And it hurts me deep inside
To know that the person that just hurt you
And made you cry
Is one who really, really loves you
(really, really loves you, ooh)
And it hurts me deep inside

Oh, I wish I could go back in time, girl
I would fix up my mistake
Everything would be alright, yeah
And girl I know just what is on your mind
Wouldn't blame if you hated me
For the rest of my life

Didn't mean to hurt you
To make you cry
(to make you cry, girl)
Oh girl, you know I really love you
And it hurts me deep inside

And it hurts me deep inside

To make you cry

Oh girl, you know I really love you
And it hurts me deep inside
To know that the person that just hurt you

Is one who really, really loves you
And it hurts me deep inside
