Tear me apart, break my heart
Let me in this wonderland with you
Short desire warms my heart
I loved


She said she want to fall in love
She said she want to give it up, oh
She said she want to turn my life all around
She said she want to play the game
I love it when you say my name
I love it when you say you want me around

I want to fall, let me fall, let me fall with you
Please, just let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you
(Let me fall with you)
Girl, let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you
(Just let me fall with you)
Please, just let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you

Now I am here with you
The sun comes through
The moon is watching us, me and you
The sun is going down (the rain comes down)
The rain is coming down
And the wind is blowing us and it is you

She said she want to fall in love (She says)
She said she want to give it up
She said she want to turn my life all around

Stay with me, you are making me say
Stay with me, I am making my way
Inside the world, inside the world
My life, you are my life
You are my world, yea girl
I will always be with you tonight

Ooh, I just want to fall tonight with you
(Happily fell, happily fell)
(Ooh, loving you)
(You are beautiful, wonderful, I love you so)
(You are beautiful)
(I love you so, I love you so)
(Oh, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah)
