Hello, august moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon
'Cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said
If you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue
And it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant
I'll stay home in bed


And I'll be loving you
That's what I want to do
I'll be loving you
That's what I want to do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss
Our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant
I'll stay here with you

And I'll be loving you
That's what I want to do
I'll be loving you
That's what I want to do

It seems you don't know
We reached the hightened mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven
I can really feel it when you're near
Ooh

And the weatherman said
If you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue
And it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant
I'll stay home in bed

And I'll be loving you
That's what I want to do
I'll be loving you
That's what I want to do
I'll be loving you
That's what I want to do
I'll be loving you
That's what I want to do

Loving you
That's what I want to do
Loving you
That's what I want to do
Loving you
That's what I want to do
Loving you
That's what I want to do

Loving you
That's what I want to
