And oh my darling, now you're gone
       Love is here
       And oh my darling, now you're gone
       You persuaded me to love you
       And I did
       But instead of tenderness
       I found heartache instead
       Into your arms I fell
       So unaware of the loneliness
       Thar was waiting there


       You closed the door to your heart, girl
       And you turned the key
       Locked your love away from me

       Love is here
       And oh my darling, now you're gone
       You made me love you
       And oh my darling, now you're gone
       You said loving you
       Would make life beautiful
       With each passing day
       But as soon as love came
       Into my heart
       You turned and you walked
       Just walked away

       You stripped me of my dreams
       You gave me faith, then you took my hope
       Look at me now

       Look at me
       See what loving has done to me
       Look at my face
       See how cryin' has left its trace
       After you made me all your own
       Then you left me all alone
       You made your words sound so sweet
       Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

       My heart cries out for your touch
       But baby, you're not there
       And the lonely cry fades in the air

       Love is here
       And oh my darling, now you're gone
       Love is here
       And oh my darling, now you're gone
       You made me love you
       Oh oh my darling, now you're gone
       Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,
       Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone
