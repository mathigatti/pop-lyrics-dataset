Lookin' through the window
Lookin' through the window (ah)
Lookin' through the window
Look look look through the window
(oh ah)
Lookin' through the window


Lookin' through the windows
The window to your heart (oh baby yeah)
I can see its cloudy
The rain's about to start

Lookin' through the windows (lookin' through the windows)
It seems i've caused your fears (yea yea yea)
And that little doubt girl (and your little doubt girl)
And now it's bringin' tears (and its bringin' tears)

Remember

Just remember what ever makes you feel that way
Don't you worry 'cause i'm gonna stay
Right by your side (by your side)
To keep on lookin' through the windows
Lookin' in you eyes
(ooh lookin' in your eyes, eyes, eyes)
(lookin, lookin' in your eyes, eyes, eyes)

Lookin' through the windows (lookin' through the windows)
Seems like the only way (yeah)
I can know your feelings
If you still love me today

Remember

Just remember what ever makes you feel that way
Dont you worry 'cause im gonna stay
Right by your side
To keep on lookin' through the windows
Lookin' in you eyes
(ooh, lookin' in your eyes, eyes, eyes)
(lookin, lookin' in you eyes, eyes, eyes)

Lookin' through the windows
The window to your heart

Lookin' through the windows
The window to your heart

Za-da-da-da-da-da
