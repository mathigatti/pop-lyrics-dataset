"First rule on this world baby...
Don't pay attention to anything you see on the news."


She was there just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And would you like to go with me?
And she aswered no to me
But I guess I've learned my lesson much too soon

I never thought she'd leave me forever
But who knows just what the future brings?
And would she like to go with me?
And she aswered no to me
But I guess I've learned my lesson much too soon

Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would fill with gold
Just...

I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And hoping that my prayers will see
The day that you'll come back to me
But I guess I've learned my lesson much too soon

Yes, I guess I've learned my lesson much too soon
