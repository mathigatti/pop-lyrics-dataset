I watched you on the floor
Cheek to cheek
She's getting to you
You didn't see, her eyes on me, no
She looked right through you
(Before you make)
Before you make
(A big mistake)
Remember
That looks can fool you, babe (hee!)
There's something I would sure appreciate
(If you can keep a secret)


Baby loves me
But she never shows
She cares
(No, you won't see her kiss
And hug me)
Baby loves me
No she acts like I'm
Not there
(That doesn't mean she
Doesn't love me-ooo)

If they ask her
Tell 'em that we're just
Good friends
Dah! Chika-chika-chika-ah!
Just good friends
Ah! Chika-chika-ah!
Oh
(Doot-do-do-doo)
Hee! Aaow!
Just good friends

[Stevie Wonder]
You better take advice
Never trust-first impressions
I tried to hide this affair
From their suspicions

So even if she's asking you
To stay
You better know where
You stand
(You better know where
You stand)

Baby loves me
Though she never shows
She cares
(No, you won't see her kiss
And hug me)
My baby loves me
Though she acts like I'm
Not there
(That doesn't mean she
Doesn't love me-ooo)

Now if they ask you
Jus' tell 'em that we're just
Good friends

Yes just good friends
(Just good friends)
Root-do-do-do
(Doot-do-do-do)
Just good friends

Listen up, hee we've got a
Problem here

[Stevie]
I can see the signs

[Michael]
I guess the lady

[Stevie &amp; Michael]
Is still making up her mind
(Mind)
(Say we're just good friends)

Baby loves me
Though she never shows
She cares
(Never shows she cares)
No you won't see her kiss
And hug me
(Just good friends)
(My baby loves me)

Though she acts like I'm not
There
You doggone lover, hee
Aaow!
(Doot-do-do-doo)

Don't you wanna know? My
Baby loves me
Though she never shows
She cares
(Never shows she cares)

Hee! Hee!

[Stevie]
She doesn't kiss and hug me
(Just good friends)

My baby loves me
She love me, she love me
Hee! Hee! Hee! Hoo! Hoo!
(Doot-do-do-doo)
(Never shows she cares)
