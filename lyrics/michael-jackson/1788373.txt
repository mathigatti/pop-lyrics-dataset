I am your joy
Your best of joy
I am the moonlight
You are the spring
Our Love's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you


I am forever
I am the one who came
When you fell down
I was the only one around you (the only one)
When things would hurt you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you were free?
When living seemed so hard to be
When things would hurt you

I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

I am your friend
Through thick and thin
We need each other
We'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We never say I don't need you

We are forever
I am the one who said that you were free
When living seemed so hard to be
(The only one)
And nothing would cheer you

I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the walls came tumbling down
And things would hurt you

I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

You are the Sun that lights up the sky
When things are shady
Let come what may we do get by
I was the only one around (the only one)
When things would hurt you

We are forever (I am forever)
We are forever (I am forever)
We are forever
We are forever
We are forever
We are forever

I am forever
I am forever
We are forever
We are forever
I am forever
I am forever
