I'd like to be yours
Tomorrow
So I'm giving you some time
To think it over today


But you can't take my blues away
No matter what you say, hey
You can't take my blues away
No matter what you say
What you say, hey, babe

Hey, babe
What's your thinking
No darlin'
It won't, won't change my mind

But you can't take my blues away
Now tell me what you say, babe
You can't take my blues away
No matter what you say
What you say, hey, babe

This way I feel
I know that's it's true
Because it's for you
You know that it's true
But you try to be
Hard to resist
I ask what it's for
You know you close the door
(No no, no no)
Yeah
(No no, no no)
Tell me what you say, babe
Say, yeah, babe
You can't take my blues away
Tell me what you say
What you say, yeah, babe

I've got the power
Doin' it out
Say anything
'Cause I've got this feeling
Say I
I've got the power
Come on
Yeah
Come on
