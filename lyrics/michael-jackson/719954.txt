You better stop
Your doggin' around
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause if you don't stop
I'm gonna have to put you down


I can't take it much longer
My heart's getting weak
It's not getting any stronger
You keep me so upset
My head's in a whirl
But if you wanna be, yeah
Be my girl

You better stop
Your doggin' around
You know what I'm talkin' about
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If you don't stop
I'm gonna have to put you down
Baby, yes I do, yes I do
Gonna, gonna put you down
You're doggin' me (repeat)
I'm gonna have to put you down

Yes you do, you're doggin' me (repeat)
You better stop
Your doggin' me around
