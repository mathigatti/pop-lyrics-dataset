I need you, girl
I couldn't live a day without you
Well I tried to write a special song
A love song just for you
To explain the way you make me feel inside
Though the meaning may be simple
And the words may not be new
I couldn't make it clearer if I tried
I need you
And I couldn't live a day without you
I need you
More than anyone could ever know
I need you
And I wanna build my world around you
I need you
I need you
Well I sang the words and realized
It'd all been said before
So I tried a different line that meant the same
But it didn't have the feeling
And the first one said much more
So I guess I'll have to say it once again
I need you
And I couldn't live a day without you
I need you
More than anyone could ever know
(More than anyone could ever know)
I couldn't live a day without you, girl
I need you and I wanna build my world around you
Baby
(I need you)
(Oh I need you)
Baby
(Couldn't live a day without you)
(Ooh)
More than anyone could ever know
(More than anyone could ever know)
I couldn't live a day without you, girl
I need you and I wanna build my world around you
(Ooh)
(I need you)
I need you
(I need you)
And I couldn't live a day without you
(I want you)
(Couldn't live a day without you)
I need you
(yeah, yeah)
More than anyone could ever know
(I say it ever and ever)
I need you
(I need you)
And I wanna build my world around you
(I want you)
(Couldn't live a day without you)
I need you
(yeah, yeah)
I need you
Well I tried to write a special song
A love song just for you
I need you
