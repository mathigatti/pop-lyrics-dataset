Aaow!
Hoo Hoo!


I don't care what you talkin'
'Bout baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walkin'
Beggin' back mama
I don't care anyway
Time after time I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I
Can't climb baby
All is going my way

'Cause
(There's a time when you're right)
(And you know you must right)
Who's laughing baby, don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make)
(And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin' baby

So just leave me alone
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone-stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around
(Just stop doggin' me)

There was a time I used to
Say girl I need you
But who is sorry now
You really hurt, you used to
Take and deceive me
Now who is sorry now
You got a way of making me
Feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walkin'-
Beggin' I ain't lovin' you
Don't you get in my way

'Cause
(There's a time when you're right)
(And you know you must right)
Who's laughing baby, don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make)
(And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin' baby

So just leave me alone
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around
(Just stop doggin' me)

'Cause
(There's a time when you're right)
(And you know you must right)
Who's laughing baby, don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make)
(And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin' baby

So just leave me alone
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone-stop it!

Just stop doggin' me around
(Just stop doggin' me)
Don't come beggin' me
Don't come beggin'
Don't come lovin' me
Don't come beggin'
I love you
I don't want it
I don't
I don't
I don't
I, I, aow!
Hee hee!
Don't come beggin' me
Don't come beggin'
Don't come lovin' me
Don't come beggin'
I love you
I don't want it
I don't need it
