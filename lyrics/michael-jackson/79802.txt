There’s a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it’s coming through the walls
Now it’s coming down the stairs
Then there’s screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere


I’m gonna be
Exactly what you wanna see
It’s you whose haunting me
Your warning me
To be the stranger
In your life
Am I amusing you
Or just confusing you
Am I the beast
You visualized

And if you wanna to see
Eccentricalities
I’ll be grotesque
Before your eyes
Let them all materialize

Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh
Is it scary for you baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you baby

There’s a creak beneath the floor
There’s a creak behind the door
There’s a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
Their’s a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin’ and a yawnin’
Where restless soul’s spoke

I’m gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The foolish trickery
And spirits dancing
In the light

But if you came to see
The truth the purity
It’s here inside
A lonely heart
So let the performance start

Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh
Am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for you
So tell me is it scary for you baby
So tell me is it crazy for you baby
Am I scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for ya

Masquerade the heart
Is the height of haunting souls
Just not what you seek of me
Can the heart reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you

Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh
Am I scary for you baby
Is it scary for you
So tell me am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for ya baby
Is is scary for ya baby
Am I scary for you

(I don’t wanna talk about it)
Am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for you
I’m tired of being abused
You know you’re scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you baby
