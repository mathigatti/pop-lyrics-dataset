There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces


There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
A living hope for a world fill with joy
There must be more to life than this

Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying c'est la vie
So this is life?

There must be more to life than killing
There must be more to life than this
A living hope for a world fill with love
There we can all just live in peace

There must be more to life than this
There must be more than meets the eye
A living hope for a world fill with love
There must be more to life, than this
There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this
