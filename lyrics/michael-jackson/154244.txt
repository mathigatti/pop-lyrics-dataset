There's a feeling here inside. 
That I cannot hide, and I know I've tried, 
But it's turning me around. 
I'm not sure that I'm aware 
If I'm up or down, or here or there 
I need both feet on the ground. 


Maybe I'm just going crazy, 
Letting myself get up-tight; 
I'm acting just like a baby, 
But I'm- gonna be-I'm gonna be allright! 

Soon as I get home 
Soon as I get home 
Soon as I get home 

In a diff'rent place, in a diff'rent time, 
Differ'rent people around me- 
I would like to know of that diff'rent world 
And how diff'rent they find me 

And just what's a Wiz, is it big? 
Will it scare me? 
If I ask to leave, will the Wiz even hear me? 
How will I know then- 
If I'll ever get home again? 

Here I am alone, though it feels the same, 
I don't know where I'm going; 
I'm here on my own, and it's not a game, 
And now a strange wind is blowing 

I'm so amazed at the things that I see here, 
Don't want to be afraid, 
I just don't wanna be here; 
In my mind this is clear, 
What am I doing here? 
I wish I was home.
