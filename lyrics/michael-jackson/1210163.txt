(Chigga, chigga)

You know I can't get away from you, girl
You've got me shaking
I tried of all the things you do, girl
My body is aching
Come on, baby, get up and rock it to the rhythem
Put up your heart to me, and lady
Let me set you free

Our love will shine at the dawn of a brandnew feeling
Just take your time, and you see that the the magic's on its way
Girl, if we try, we can send all our senses reeling pass the day
You know I've got the hots tonight

Night, girl (girl)

Without your heart to me, the night
Will let me set you free (let me set you free, girl!)

Our love will shine at the dawn of a brandnew feeling
