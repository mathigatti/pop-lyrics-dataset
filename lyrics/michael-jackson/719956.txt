In the end only love lives on
So take a moment while you can
To stop one heart from breaking


I've felt peace and I've felt pain
Every generation seems to pass the blame
It's up to us to make a change
Let it ring across the land

I have this dream, which I believe
That the world can live as one in harmony
Every child who's born
Needs to believe that he belongs
I have this dream

You and I have this chance
To hold the future in our hands
We can light the darkest night
And make a new tomorrow

I have this dream, which I believe
That the world can live as one in harmony
Every child who's born
Needs to believe that he belongs
I have this dream

It's a dream that once began
Becomes a song that has no end
And when the angels all join in
We'll make the heavens sing
