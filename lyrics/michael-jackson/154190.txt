Lose it? Lose it? 
I don't even know the first thing about what they're feeling; 
What am I afraid of? 
Don't know what I'm made of, 
Can I go on, not knowing? 
Feeling? Feeling? 
Something tells me that it's more than I can deal with; 
Tho I never knew the song, 
Some words still catch on like caring, 
And sharing being together, no matter, 
Can I go on not knowing? 
Don't know what I'm made of, 
why am I afraid of 
Feel-ing? Feel-ing? If I dare to take a chance, 
Would someone lead me?
