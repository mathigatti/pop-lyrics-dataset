Skywriter
Sweep your silver pen,
Across the sky So high
Skywriter
Won't you write the biggest
I love you
Cross the sky


She don't read the letters
I write anymore
Sorry I upset her
But I wasn't sure
Now I know I love her
I hope that she will see
A message high above her
That you write for me, yeah.

Hey Hey
Send a box of cande
And flowers every day
Still she wouldn't listen
Her pride got in the way
Now it's up to you
It won't fade away
Write it on the heavens
Love will make it stay, yeah
