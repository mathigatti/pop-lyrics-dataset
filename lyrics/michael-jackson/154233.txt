Mind Is The Magic 
Come in to me
I know mystical garden
Orchards and violets
All mysteries are parted
Life is a mirageghost
Imagination
Pure inspiration called justification


Nothing's impossible
Nothing's concealed
Everything here is for real
What gives fantastic ghouls all in your head?
Who creates wonders like nobody can?

Chorus:
Siegfried &amp; Roy
You know it's
Siegfried &amp; Roy
So be it
Siegfried &amp; Roy
I'm gonna...
Siegfried &amp; Roy

When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

Move of the head
And I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear
From euphorics, devotions
Everything's happening
Nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real

Seeing black panthers
That suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe

[Chorus]

'Cause when it's Siegfried &amp; Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
(Seeing is believin'...)
When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true

Hallucinations
The game of this kind
This kind of magic
Throws mind

[Chorus]
