Like we really used to before we met the fall
I couldn’t get it, my youth is gone
We really had it all, oh


Hold my like you really used to
Summers in Gloucestershire
You hear these children
Singing, laughing, in the gardens
I wish that we’ll see gloucestershire
I wish that we’ll see gloucestershire
I wish that we’ll see gloucestershire, again

Ahh, ohh, mmm
