Free and untamed that's how I've grown
Settling down ain't my nature
Roots I'll never own
Oh your smile
But tell me, ain't your child
How can you cage a bird
Born to be wild


Refrain
I'm Johnny Raven by and by
Oh, I'm going to leave yoour nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave yoou
When my restless heart says goodbye

Look at you little girl
You feel love so deep
If I could change in a second
I'd change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
But I'm home free for no thrills
Stray I will
Seems I gotta need one girl
Never can feel

Refrain
Yeah I'm Johnny Raven by and by
Oh, I'm going to leave yoour nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave yoou
When my restless heart says goodbye

Everybody knows my name
I'm Johnny Raven yeah, yeah by abd by
I'm gonna fly
When you cry part of me's gonna die
