Morning glow morning glow
Starts to glimmer when you know
Winds of change are set to blow
And sweep this whole land through
Morning glow is long past due


Morning glow fill the earth
Come on shine far all you're worth
We'll be present at the birth
Of all faith looking new
Morning glow is long past due

Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
You should have started long ago

Morning glow all days long
For we sing tomorrow's song
Never knew we could be so strong
But now it's very clear
Morning glow is almost here

Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
We should have started long ago

Morning glow all your life
We can make the new day right
All the bad songs of the night
Will fade into the past
Morning glow is here at last
