There comes a time when we hear a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
There greatest gift of all


We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of Gods great big family
And the truth
You know, love is all we need

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice we're making
We're saving out own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We'll send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice we're making
We're saving out own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

When you're down and out
There seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Let us realize that a change can only come
When we
Stand together as one, yeah, yeah, yeah

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice we're making
We're saving out own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice we're making
We're saving out own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
