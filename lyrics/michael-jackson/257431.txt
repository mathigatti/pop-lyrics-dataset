The game of love
Is such a beautiful game
If you've got time, little girl
I'd like to explain
All the do's and dont's
All the wills and wont's


So Lend an ear, darling dear
(Sweet darling dear)
Do be sincere
And true love will appear
Don't be shy
Or love will pass you by
If you will
My heart you may steal
If you don't
The game of love you lose alone

(Darling dear)

Do be sincere
And true love will appear
Don't be shy
Or love will pass you by
If you will
My heart you may steal
If you don't
The game of love you lose alone

(First)
First I'll place my arms
So gently around you
(Then)
Then whisper darling I'm so glad I found you

Then your lips unwind
A simple touch wouldn't mind
A kiss will stay, darling dear
(Sweet darling)
Darling, darling dear, yeah
(Sweet darling dear)
Darling dear
(Sweet darling dear)
