Those sweet memories.
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we did
Now baby


Do you remember the time
(do you remember?)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl.
Do you remember the time
Oh why?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

On the phone you and me
Remember the time
Till dawn, two or three
What about us girl

Remember the time
Do you. do you, do you,
Do you, do you
Remember the time
In the park, on the beach
Remember the time
You and me in spain
Remember the time
What about, what about...

Do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
