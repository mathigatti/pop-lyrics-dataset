Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Dont try to fight it
There aint nothin that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You got to feel the heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love
Chorus
I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
Were gonna rock the night away


Out on the floor
There aint nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
Theres a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
Cause we got so far to go
When you feel that heat
And were gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
Were gonna rock the night away

And when the groove is dead and gone (yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever, on
Refrain
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

I wanna rock (all night) with you girl (sunlight)
Rock with you, rock with you girl (yeah)
(all night)
Dance the night away

I wanna rock with you (yeah) (all night)
Rock you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
Rock the night away
Feel the heat feel the beat
Rock you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock - rock the night away
