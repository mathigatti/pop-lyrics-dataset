My life, has taken me beyond, the planets and the stars.
And you're the only one, that could take me this far.
I'll be forever searching for your love.


[CHORUS]

I wallked away, but i was wrong
(i can't make it another day)
You're the one, that makes me strong
(i can't make it another day)
you're the fire, that keeps me warm
(i can't make it another day)
How did i get through this strom?
(i can't make it another day without your love)

At night, I pray before i sleep hope of finding you
I've opened up my heart, i want you to come through.
I close my eyes searching for your love.

[ CHORUS OUT ]
