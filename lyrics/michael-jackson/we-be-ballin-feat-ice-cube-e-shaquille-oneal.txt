I love this game, yeah
Haha, haha, haha!
Yeah!


We be balling
Everybody likes sort of plays we calling
Your team falling
We ain't stalling
We just slamming and jamming
Like it ain't nothing wrong

(Booya!) It's back
The NBA's where it's at
We the max
VIP's, watching Shaq stacking up the numbers
Back in the promise stunnah
You ought a check him smarter or a little harder
Now we can fall on land, air and water
Catch a --? -- then you think she ought a
You have to order the smarter
Any team like that
Jordan me and Shaq
A dream team pack
Watch my man Allen and I, take it to the rim!
Two minutes left and we winning by ten
We proudly win, we all --? -- up
(Boo!) You in my house, you get no love

We be balling
Everybody likes sort of plays we calling
Your team falling
We ain't stalling
We just slamming and jamming
Like it ain't nothing wrong
(Bring it) Get your ball on!

[Michael Jackson]
Nothing you can say, nothing you can do
We be balling you, we be balling you
No one to defeat, you'll see what we can do
We be balling you, we be balling you

[Shaquille O'Neal]
Baby like Rolls Royce
Rashaun for short
Keep my flow
Like low punks
Nice and swift
Priceless gift
The part of we hitting
Bigger your bruise
Better field no excuses
Say play at you lose
Pay my dues
Ice Cube is with me
We quite nifty
Ballers making history
By being quick as 50
You ballers, with daisy champ baby
What's your thing
They don't go whoever, whenever
Emitten' angst (Yeah, Yeah!)

I been balling
Shaq calling
There's another game played
LIVE 98' for the fame
Ice Cube, do these kids wanna be him
They die and trade for, --? --- Colosseum
We ain't bet you, kill balling
Forward thrust, crossover left-right
Carved in the dust (What!)
Haha, haha, What! (What!)

[Ice Cube]
We be balling
Everybody likes sort of plays we calling
Your team falling
We ain't stalling
We just slamming and jamming
Like it ain't nothing wrong
Get your ball on!

[Michael Jackson]
Nothing you can say, nothing you can do
We be balling you, we be balling you
No one to defeat, you'll see what we can do
We be balling you, we be balling you

I'm MVP
So what's up now?
The number two team
Just touchdown
Watch me as I can
I put myself over to the floor
And not going in for the score
It's pulling off my flow
They start to push and shove
The skills us possess
Must come from up above
Look, for everybody waiting on us
And scrub, for everybody hating on us
Their waiting on us
A day only visiting
And their trying to come to my house, and when
I see you watching me, but I'm the flybird
And I can take you to the home, like the doctor (Watch)

As I see her getting home
Does she know
That I'm a superstar?
Don't they know who we are
We going all the way baby
We going win this war

Nothing you can say, nothing you can do
We be balling you, we be balling you
No one to defeat, you'll see what we can do
We be balling you, we be balling you

So hard to defeat, we love just to compete
We be balling you, we be balling you
Hate to make you plead, we'll bring you to your knees
We be balling you, we be balling you

[Ice Cube]
Shake them off, shake them off, take them off
For the real, for the real, we rock them in
Shake them off, shake them off, take them off
For the real, for the real, we rock them in

We be balling, we be balling
We be balling, we be balling
We be balling, we be Balling
We be balling
