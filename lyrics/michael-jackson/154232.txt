I woke up yesterday
Knowing that I was lost in the past somewhere
I felt my destiny were sad the rain
Going nowhere


There's a sound, must be melody
I got song you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Make my heart keep turn
To the music got to love that filled my mind

Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only
Oh, oh

The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
The questions in my mind
Have an answer now love don't hold me
All the girls have brighten now
And the darkness is lighter now
Is my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye yesterday

Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know there's music to my ears
Every word that you say

Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

(Fade out)
