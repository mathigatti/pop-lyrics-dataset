Oh, sure don't baby, baby, baby
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
But I love you


Always treat me like a fool
Kick me when I'm down
That you do
I don't know why I love you
But I love you


Oh, you'll never, you'll never stop your cheating ways
With another guy you laugh in my face
Lord, how long must I be disgraced
'Cause I love you
Oh, baby, baby, baby


I don't know why I love you
I don't know you and me, baby
Oh, yeah, I don't know why I love you
But I love you, baby
Oh darling, darling, darling, darling


You throw my heart down in the dirt
Oh, you make me crawl
On this cold black earth, baby, yeah
I never knew, I never knew how much love could hurt
'Til I love you baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah


Can't stop, I can't stop crying
Can't you see
Here I'm pleading on my knees
Upon my knees, yeah, baby, yeah
Won't you help me, help me, please
'Cause I love you, love you, love you
Ooh, sure know, baby


I don't know, you don't know
We don't know nothing about it
I can't do nothing about it
I don't know, baby
I don't know
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, I don't know, baby
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know nothing about it
