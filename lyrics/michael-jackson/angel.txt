(Nobody's going to believe the story
It's ok)


I dreamed I saw a girl
Oh, so beautiful to me
Her eyes shine like the stars
Is she revealed herself to me?

She never said a word
As she smiled and danced for me
And then she disappeared
No I'm left with memories

I know this might sound strange
But i'm trying to explain
How an angel came to me

Whoa
She came
Yes
She did

His presence was so real
And her timing so divine
I know this was a dream
But could this girl be mine

Maybe I'm just a fool
But sometimes dreams do come true
I'm hopelessly in love
With someone I never knew

I know this might sound strange
I still I'm trying to explain
How an angel came to me

So incredible
So delightful
The girl of my dreams
Impossible it seems

I know you ask who could this be
I don't know
Oh
I don't know
No
I don't know


But I wish I could explain
How an angel came to me
