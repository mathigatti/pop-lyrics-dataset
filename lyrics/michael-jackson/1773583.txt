She's lookin' for a job and a finer place to stay
She's lookin' for the hope in the empty promises
She's workin' two jobs
Keepin' alive
She works in a resturaunt night and day
She waits her life away
She wipes the tears away


She cries inside every time she feels this way
And she's dying inside every time her baby cries (no)

Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind just stay alive
Keepin' your wings so we can fly
(Keep your head up tonight)
Keepin' your head up to the sky
And we can just rise up tell me now
Gimme your wings so we can fly

Giving up the life of the birds in the trees
And we're sucking up the air in the earth from underneath
(It's never too late) I can't even breathe
(To see) I can't even see
(Oh keep) keep your head up don't give up today
How long can we wait?
I wish that love would come today

All you need is love
Tell you I'm always coming soon
And all you need is just a moment won't do
Keep your head up

Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind just stay alive (just stay alive)
Gimme your wings so we can fly (fly away, fly away, fly away)
(Keep your head up tonight)
Keepin' your head up to the sky
And we can just rise up tell me now
Gimme your wings so we can fly
(Oh, why)

Everybody say the time is borrowed
And hanging down your head just ain't no good
And if you dance and rise above tomorrow (give it a chance)
Just give yourself a chance
Find the circumstance
Rise and do it again

Keepin' your head up to the sky (oh God, oh no)
Keepin' your mind just stay alive
Gimme your wings so we can fly (hoo-hoo!)
(Yeah, yeah!)

(Keep your head up!) keepin' your head up to the sky
And we can just rise up tell me now (oh)
Gimme your wings so we can fly (hoo-hoo!)

(Keep your head up!) keepin' your head up to the sky
(I needed you then, I needed you now, I needed you night right through the day)
Keepin' your mind just stay alive (I needed you now)
Keepin' your wings so we can fly (hoo-hoo!)
(Yeah!)

(Keep your head up!) keepin' your head up to the sky
(I needed you then, I needed you now, I needed you night right through the day)
And we can just rise up tell me now, (I needed you now)
Gimme your wings so we can fly, (hoo-hoo-hoo!)

(Keep your head up!)
What about yesterday?
What about yesterday?
(Those stars gonna rise (gonna rise) today! Today!)

(Keep your head up!)
What about all their joy?
What about yesterday? (oh)
(Gonna shine, must fly, gonna rise (gonna rise) today! Today!)

(Keep your head up!)
(What about yesterday?

(Those stars gonna rise (gonna rise) today! Today!)
