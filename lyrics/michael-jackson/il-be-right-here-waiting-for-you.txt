Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever


Wherever you do
Whatever you say
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you do
Whatever you say
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
