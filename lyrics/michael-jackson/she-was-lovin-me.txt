She was my life and my greatest star
She was my life when I lost my faith
I never knew how much she loved me
Perhaps it could be, cause she never felt like I've


She had my hand and she gave me a break
Why did she hurt me that way

She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore
She was my love and now she's gone
They told me you don't know about this girl
She was loving me

She was my dream and my happiness
She was my friend and my deepest journey
Now I cant stand seeing her face again
Perhaps it could be, cause she's got someone else

She had my hand and she gave me a break
Why did she hurt me that way

She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore
She was my love and now she's gone
They told me you don't know about this girl
She was loving me

She had my hand and she gave me a break
Why did she hurt me that way

She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore
She was my love and now she's gone
They told me you don't know about this girl
She was loving me

She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore
She was my love and now she's gone
They told me you don't know about this girl
She was loving me

She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore
She was my love and now she's gone
They told me you don't know about this girl
She was loving me
