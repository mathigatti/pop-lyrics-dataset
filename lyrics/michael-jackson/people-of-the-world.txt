People all over the world
People from country to country
Are one and the same in the world
And one song we sing
Life should be in harmony
In this world of selfdestruction
Nations lift your voices and sing

You need to be of semeone die
Need the truth of any die
Got do, got do, people do
I need to be soon if any die
Need to be open any die
Got do, got do, people do

Di ru ru, di ri ri, di ri ri, of black virginia
What I have learned?

People all over the world
People from country to country
Are one and the same in the world
And one song we sing
Life should be in harmony
In this world of selfdestruction
Nations lift your voices and sing

Life should be in harmony
In this world of selfdestruction
Nations lift your voices and sing
