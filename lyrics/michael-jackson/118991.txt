We've been together for such a long time now
Music, music and me
Don't care whether all our songs rhyme
Now music, music and me


Only know wherever I go
We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers
Like music, music and me

Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind you will find
A world of sweet harmony

Birds of a feather will fly together
Now music, music and me
Music and me
