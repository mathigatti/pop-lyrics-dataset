Message to you

The planets are linin' up
We're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line
Waitin' for you
Can't you see?
You're just another part of me

A rather nation
Fulfill the truth
The final message
We'll bring to you
There is no danger
Fulfill the truth
So come together
We're mean is you

We're sendin' out
A major love
And this is our
Message to you
(Message to you)
The planets are linin' up
We're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line
Waitin' for you
So look the truth
You're just another part of me
