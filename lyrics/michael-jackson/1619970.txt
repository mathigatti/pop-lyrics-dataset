Live and sigh, crying eyes
Your touch, your heart, your warmth lullaby
Live to dream, don't it seem
The tears, the pain,
Reality


Don't you know
These dreams I wish could be
The real you and me
I come running back to you
You push me away, you push
You push me away

Darken days, go away
The nights are bright, dream and stay
As I dream loving you
Your touch, your heart, your warmth
Please come true

Don't you know
These dreams I wish could be
The real you and me
I come running back to you
You push me away, you push
You push me away

Don't you know
These dreams I wish could be
The real you and me
I come running back to you
You push me away, you push
You push me away
