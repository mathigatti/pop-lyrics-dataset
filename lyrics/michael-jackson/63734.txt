Your body is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I’m telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don’t shoot to kill


Come on
Come on
Lay it on me
All right

I’m giving you
On count to three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I’m telling you
Just to watch your mouth
I know your game
What you’re about

Well they say the sky’s the limit
And to me that’s really true
But my friend you have seen nothin’
Just wait ’till I get through

Because I’m bad, I’m bad, come on
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I’m bad, I’m bad, you know it
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I’m bad, I’m bad, come on, you know
(Bad bad, really, really bad)

And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who’s bad

The word is out
You’re doin’ wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long
Your lyin’ eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don’t make a fight

Your talk is cheap
You’re not a man
You’re throwin’ stones
To hide your hands

But they say the sky’s the limit
And to me that’s really true
And my friends you have seen nothin’
Just wait ’till I get through

Because I’m bad, I’m bad, come on
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I’m bad, I’m bad, you know it
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I’m bad, I’m bad, you know it, you know
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad bad, really really bad)
You know I'm bad, you know me
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad bad, really really bad)

And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who’s bad

Because I’m bad, I’m bad, come on
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I’m bad, I’m bad, you know it
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I’m bad, I’m bad, you know it, you know
(Bad bad, really, really bad)

(And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again)

You know I’m bad, I’m bad, come on
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I’m bad, I’m bad, you know it, you know it
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know me, you know me, you know me, come on
(Bad bad, really, really bad)

And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you

You know I’m smooth, I’m bad, you know it
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I’m bad, I’m bad baby
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know it, come on
(Bad bad, really, really bad)

(And the whole world has to answer right now)
(Just to tell you once again)

You know I’m bad, I’m bad, you know it
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I’m bad, you know
(Bad bad, really, really bad)
You know I’m bad, I’m bad, you know it, you know
(Bad bad, really, really bad)

(And the whole world has to answer right now)
(Just to tell you once again)
Who’s bad?
