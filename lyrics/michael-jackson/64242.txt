Looking out across the night-time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs


Get me out into the night-time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say, why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?

If they say, why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?

Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say, why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?

If they say, why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?

I like living this way
I like loving this way

Looking out across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say, why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?

If they say, why, why?
Oh! Tell them
Why, why does he do me that way?

If they say, why, why?
Cha, cha, cha
Why, why does he do me that way?

If they say, why, why?
Oh! Tell them
Why, why does he do me that way?

If they say, why, why?
Oh! Tell them
Why, why does he do me that way?

If they say, why, why?
Da, da, da
Why, why does he do me that way?

I like living this way
