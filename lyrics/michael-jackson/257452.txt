You're just preaching the Bible and they still speakin you're a lier 
And you still deal with the fires 
That they made...


dah dah dah dah dah 
dah dah dah dah dah 
dah dah dah dah dah, you 
dah dah dah dah dah 
dah dah dah dah dah 
dah dah dah dah dah 

Why you wanna get me? 
Dreams don't last forever 
Why you wanna fix me? 
See, if the police don't take it 
God forsake it 
I can't take it 

Why you stab me in the back? 

We're so gonna loose 
And she, knows they got this to be 
She... I dah dah dah dah dah 

dah dah dah dah dah 
dah dah dah dah dah 
dah dah dah dah dah people 
dah dah dah dah dah 
dah dah dah dah dah 
dah dah dah dah dah 

Why you wanna get me? 
This dude won't last forever 
Why you wanna hit me? 
See, if the police don't take it 
God forsake it 
I'll fell breaking 

Why you stab me in the back?
