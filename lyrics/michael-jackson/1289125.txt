Akon and MJ
Oh, yeah, yeah


This life don't last forever (hold my hand)
So tell me what we're waiting for (hold my hand)
We're better off being together (hold my hand)
Than being miserable alone (hold my hand)

'Cause I've been there before
And you've been there before
But together we can be all right, yeah
'Cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold
We hold each other 'til we see the sunlight

So if you just hold my hand
Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can
Things will go better if you just hold my hand
Nothing can come between us
If you just hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold, hold my hand
Hold my hand

The nights are getting darker (hold my hand)
And there's no peace inside (oh, yeah)
So why make our lives harder (hold my hand)
By fighting love tonight baby

'Cause I've been there before
And you've been there before
But together we can be all right
'Cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold
We hold each other 'til we see the sunlight

But you can just, hold my hand
Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can
Things will go better if you just hold my hand
Nothing can come between us if you just
Hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold, hold my hand
Hold my hand

I can tell that you're tired of being lonely (yeah)
Take my hand, don't let go, baby hold me (hold my hand)
Come to me and let me be your one and only (hold my hand)
'Cause I can make it all right 'til the morning (hold my hand)
I can tell that you're tired of being lonely (hold my hand)
Take my hand, don't let go, baby hold me (ooh, hold me)
Come to me and let me be your one and only (one and only)
'Cause I can make it all right 'til the morning (hold my hand)

Hold my hand (yeah)
Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can
Things will go better if you just hold my hand
Nothing can come between us if you just
Hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold, hold my hand
Hold my hand

Hold my hand (yeah, yeah)
All I can (yeah, yeah)
Hold my hand
Hold my hand
Nothing can come between us if you just
Hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold, hold my hand
Hold, hold my hand

Hold my hand
