Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful
She's so true, oh yeah
Her dreams are tumblin' 
Her world is crumblin'
Because of you, uh uh
One day you'll hurt her just once too much
And when you finally lose your tender touch


Refrain
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
You gonna send your baby straight to me

I'm gonna give her all the lovin'
Within my heart, oh yeah
I'm gonna patch up every single little dream
You torn apart, understand me now? 
And when she tells you she's cried her last tear
Heaven knows I'm gonna be somewhere near

Refrain
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
You gonna send your baby straight to me

Oh yeah-yeah, you better
You better listen to me, yeah

Heartaches are callin' and tears are fallin'
Because of you, oh yeah
And when you're gone she'll know
I'm the one to go to her rescue
Maybe you didn't know that baby
You're gonna leave her one too many times
And when you come back that
Girl's gonna be mine, all mine
