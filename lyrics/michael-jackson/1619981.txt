You better get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone


Get up, get up, get up
Get up off your high horse, girl
Think what you're doing, doin'
Get up off your high horse, girl
Think what you're doin', doin'

I'm spinnin' around on your merry-go-round
You got me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy

Get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone

Now, now, babe

Get it together
Or leave it alone
You better, get it, get it
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone

Get up off your high horse, girl
Think what you're doin', doin'
Get up off your high horse, girl
Think what you're doin', doin'

I can't stand all this confusion
All this shuckin' and jivin'
You're putting down, down, down

Get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

Big girl what you're doing
Throwin' this heart of mine all away
Oh, big girl you know I love you
To keep a love like mine is hard this day
All ya gotta do, girl
