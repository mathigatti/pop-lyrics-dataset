Read you from a mile away
Lips that makes it easy to adore
A taste of me
Let the fountain pour
Girl, I meant like, stand and see
Ooh, I wanna taste you skin
Ooh, I wanna
Girl, I gotta wonder
If we can drown again


If you can touch me again
Say we will dance
Light fire to my skin
We burn again

Girl, I wanna testify
Ooh, come on and let light eh fire
We can make it work tonight
Baby, come on and let me light the fire

You can let me touch the fire
Ooh, come, let me light the fire
You can make me burn tonight
Rain and thunder when you burn tonight

I can't believe we're burnin' hard right now
Feel the fire
We're burnin' like hell came tonight
My soul desires (deciders)
I can't let nobody stop the thing we got
It makes you wonder
A friend of mine? Sexy wine?
Baby, why you play me like a toy

When you say, ''Take me again''
When that we dance
We passionately stop to burn again

Girl, I wanna testify
Ooh, come on and let light eh fire
We can make it work tonight
Baby, come on and let me light the fire

You can let me touch the fire
Ooh, come, let me light the fire
You can make me burn tonight
Rain and thunder when you burn tonight

(Light the fire)

Girl, I wanna testify
Ooh, come on and let light eh fire
We can make it work tonight
Baby, come on and let me light the fire

You can let me touch the fire
Ooh, come, let me light the fire
You can make me burn tonight
Rain and thunder when you burn tonight

Girl, I wanna testify
Ooh, come on and let light eh fire
We can make it work tonight
Baby, come on and let me light the fire

You can let me touch the fire
Ooh, come, let me light the fire
You can make me burn tonight
Rain and thunder when you burn tonight
