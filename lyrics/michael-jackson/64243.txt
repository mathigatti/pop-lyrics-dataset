There's something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble, just touch me
Don't hide our love
Woman to man


She's just a lover, who's doin' me by
It's worth the giving, it's worth the try
You cannot cleave it, or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it

(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it)
Yea
(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it)

It's just a feeling, you have to soothe it
You can't neglect it, you can't abuse it
It's just desire, you cannot waste it
Then, if you want it, then, won't you taste it

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it

Yeah
(She wants to give it, aahh, she wants to give it)
Doggone
(She wants to give it, aahh, she wants to give it)

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door, and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free

Ah
Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
Ooh

Just promise me, whatever we say
Whatever we do to each other
For now we take a vow to just
Keep it in the closet
Dare me

If you can get it, it's worth a try
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's aching to me, you have to promet it
She wants to give it

(She wants to give it, aahh, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(She wants to give it, aahh, she wants to give it)
Give it

Yeah
(She wants to give it, aahh, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(She wants to give it, aahh, she wants to give it)

Just open the door, and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me, you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move
Cast the spell

Ah
Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want

Just promise me, whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we take a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you

I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
Just promise me, whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet
