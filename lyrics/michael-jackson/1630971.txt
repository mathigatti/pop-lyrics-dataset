Miles away, oceans apart
never been my sight always in my heart
the love is always there it will never die
only growing stronger tears down my eye
I am thinking all the time
when the day will come
standing there before you
accept this Hajj of mine
standing in ihram, making my tawaf
drinking blessings from your well
the challenges that I have suffered
rekindles my imaan
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
praying for the day when I can be near Your Kabah wall
I feel alive and I feel strong
I can feel Islam running in my Veins
to see my Muslim brothers, their purpose all the same
greeting one another, exalting one True Name
I truly hope one day that everyone's a Muslim.
that they remember you in everything they say
standing in ihram making my tawaf, making my tawaf
drinking blessings from your well
the challenges that I have suffered
rekindles my imaan
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
praying for the day when I can be near Your Kabah wall
