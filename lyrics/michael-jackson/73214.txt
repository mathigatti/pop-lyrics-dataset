There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood upon the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
I know this place is doomed
Because now it's haunting me


I don't understand it
Don't understand it

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is floating

Don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got to see it, want to)
Don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got to see it, want to)
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got to see it, want to)
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got to see it, want to)

And who gave you the right to scare my family
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree

They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is floating

Don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got to see it, want to)
Don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got to see it, want to)
You just don't know
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got to see it, want to)
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got to see it, want to)

And who gave you the right to scare my family
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree
And who gave you the right to take intrusion to see me
And who gave you the right to shake my family
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree

You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin ghost of jealousy

And who gave you the right to scare my family
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree
And who gave you the right to take intrusion to see me
And who gave you the right to shake my family
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree

You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

Come on
But it's dynamite
A peice of mine

Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
