Blame it on the boogie

Hee, hee, hee, hee

My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in frisco at every kinda disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye


Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave
Me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, woo

I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't (yeah)
I just can't (woo) control my feet

I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet

Sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me
The devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Ow (sunshine)
Ooh (moonlight)
Yeah (good times)
Mmm (boogie)

You just gotta (sunshine)
Yeah (moonlight)
(Good times)
Good times (boogie)

Don't you blame it (sunshine)
You just gotta (moonlight)
You just wanna (good times)
Yeah, oh (boogie)

Blame it on yourself (sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault (moonlight)
But yours and that boogie (good times)
All night long (boogie)

Can't stop that boogie (sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault (moonlight)
But yours and that boogie (good times)
Dancin' all night long (boogie)

Blame it on yourself (sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault (moonlight)
But yours and that boogie, boogie, boogie (good times)
All night long (boogie)
