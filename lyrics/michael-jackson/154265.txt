Where have I been?
What should I be looking for?
What am I gonna be when I come of age?
Will I be strong? Yeah, yeah...
Will I be a mighty man?
Climb mountains if I can
When I come of age?


Hey y'all I think I'll be a movie star
Or travel to some distant star
Yeah that's it! I'm gonna be an astronaut
And rock it to the moon
And then I'll be the captain of a giant ship
I'm gonna take a long, long trip to a far off land
When I become a man

And what about love?
Will you still be in love with me?
I sure hope you will be
When I come of age
And will you be true?
Will you still want to marry me?
I guess I'll have to wait and see
When I come of age

My folks say I'm too young for love
But they don't seem to understand
That what I feel is love for somebody
A feeling I understand
And while I've got this feeling
It's you, girl, you're so grand
And I'll love you girl just as strong
When I become a age

Wait, be patient honey
You've got to believe in me
Wait, wait for me baby
It'll be just you and me
We'll do all the things
We couldn't do before
When when I come of age
We're gonna be so happy
When, when I come of age
