In this world there's so much confusion
And I've tasted the city life and it's not for me
Now I do dream of distant places
Where I don't know now, but it's Destiny


If it's the rich life, I don't want it
Happiness ain't always material things

I want Destiny
It's the place for me
Give me the simple life
I'm getting away from here
Let me be free, let me be me

I'm a man that's for all seasons
What the city offers me ain't naturally
I look to greet the stars
But there's no stars to see
Gonna search this world until I find my Destiny

If it's the rich life, I don't want it
Happiness ain't always material things

I want Destiny
It's the place for me
Give me the simple life
I'm getting away from here
Let me be free, let me be me

I'm a man that's for all seasons
What the city offers me ain't naturally
I look to greet the stars
But there's no stars to see
Gonna search this world until I find my Destiny

I wanna be far from here
Should I up and fly away so fancy free
Nobody can change my mind
I'm screamming out these words for me
While time
Destiny, ah destiny, it's calling me
Destiny, a place for me
Ah, destiny
I want destiny
