Hey girl, my only wish is to satisfy you (satisfy you),
I want to make this the best i can do (i wanna make this),
To keep you happy with all my might (all of my might),
You'll want for nothing both day and night.
I like to watch you move across the floor, and you know i do,
As much as i do now makes me want you more,
And you know that's true,
You are the only girl i adore, i'd do it all for you,
To give you what you need, all that i live for, oh girl,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no way.
(no way, no way) say you'll never have to worry,
(no way, no way) said i'll never do you wrong, girl,
(no way, no way) you're the reason that i live baby,
(always) and i sing this song to you because...

You came to me when i was in need, i didn't have no one,
And now my sole desire is to please, and you're the only one,
Just like the shining sun you warm my heart,
And make me feel secure,
And i pray to god while on earth we'll never part, oh, darling,
No, no, no, nothing babe.
