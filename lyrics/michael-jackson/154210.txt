Sadness had been
Close as my next of kin
Then Happy came one day
Chased my blues away
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was


Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lamb was I
Till you came in
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now)

Where have I been?
What life time was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until
Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now)
