I'm in love again
This time I think that it's for real
I'm in love again
I think I know just how you feel


It's like waking early on Christmas morning
And finding the toy of your dream
And that's the way you make me feel, girl
And that's the way that it should be

I'm in love again
This time I think that it's for sure
I'm in love again
It's what I've lived my whole life for

You've given me such happiness
You've given me so much joy
You've changed my sadness into gladness
How could I ask for more...

I'm in love, I'm in love again
I'm in love, I'm in love again

Ooh... I'm in love again
(I'm in love again)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...
(Ooh-ooh)
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love again
(I'm in love again)
I'm in love, I'm in love again
(I'm in love again)
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love again
(In love again)
I'm in love again
(In love again...)
