If'n I was God
Well just for spite
I woulddn't set the sun at night
'Til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see


If'n I was God
I'd fix it so without explaining
Folks would know, they'd know
What's going on inside
Of everyone else like me

Nobody hurt nobody else
Oh no I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thanking me

If'n I was God
I'd make us wise
So everyone could realise
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs, everyone

And God that in heaven what I would do
If'n I was you
If'n I was God
Love each other, reach out
And touch somebody's hand
