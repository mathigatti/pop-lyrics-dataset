I was alone in the dark when I met ya
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh
You took my hand and you told me you loved me


I was alone, there was no love in my life
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
I was afraid of life and you came in time
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)

I like the way how you're holdin' me
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me
I like the way how you're lovin' me
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me
I like the way how you're touchin' me
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
I like the way how you're kissin' me
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me
You'll see

It won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet ya
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh
I thank the heavens above that I met ya

I was alone, there was no love in my life
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
I was afraid of life and you came in time
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)

I like the way how you're lovin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me)
I like the way how you're holdin' me
(It doesn't matter how you re lovin' me)
I like the way how you're touchin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me)
I like the way how you're kissin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me)
You'll see

The world's a better place `cause you came in time
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine
I was afraid `cause I was hurt the last time

I like the way how you're holdin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me)
I like the way how you're lovin' me,
(It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me)
I like the way how you're touchin' me
(It doesn'`t matter how you are touchin' me)
I like the way how you're kissin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me)
You'll see
