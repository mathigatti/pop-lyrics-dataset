There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And after be your friend


There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And often be your end (da, uh)

She told me she forgiving me
A lifetime love forever true [uh]
But she left me for another man [uh]
And I'm singing to keep from feelin' blue
All I know is

Shada dada dada daa (oh no)
Shada dada dada daa (uh)
Shada dada dada daa
Come on take me free
(Set me free)

Here I am so all alone (uh! Ah da)
And I am so sad and lonely
Tell me what will I do

I can't heal, I'm holding on
[I’m um] seem to love me
I feel I'm your blue

They told me you should sing a song
Of happy when your feelin' blue
I’ve been singing for so very long
Still I’m crying, tell me what should I do
All I know is

Shada dada dada daa (oh no)
Shada dada dada daa
Shada dada dada daa
Come on take me please
[Set me free]

She told me she forgiving me (ah)
A lifetime, love so guaranteed (uh) [guaranteed]
But she left me for another man
And I'm singing crying helplessly
But I’ll keep singing

Shada dada dada daa (oh lord)
Shada dada dada daa (all my life)
Shada dada dada daa
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

(Wooh)

Shada dada dada daa (oh no) (and I keep crying!)
Shada dada dada daa (yes, they’re one… And me)
Shada dada dada daa (hold on, hold on)
Come on set me free
(Set me free)

All I know is

Shada dada dada daa (wooh, wooh, wooh)
Shada dada dada daa (wooh I, I ooh)
Shada dada dada daa
Come on set me free

(Set me free)

(Wooh) (wooh)

Shada da da da
