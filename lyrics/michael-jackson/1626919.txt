(Centipede)


Your love is like a raging fire
You're a snake that's on the loose
The strike is your desire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire

I feel, oh yeah, a longing for your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To give him all your love
Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Just like a centipede you've got
A lot of loving to touch

Don't you know
In the quiet of the night
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night
So many tears
And crawlin' like a centipede
(Centipede)

You came to strike him with your love
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To bite him with your love
Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Just like a centipede you've got
A lot of lovin' to touch

Don't you know
In the quiet of the night
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night
So many tears
And crawlin' like a centipede
(Centipede)

In the quiet of the night
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night
So many tears

In the quiet of the night
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
(Like a centipede)
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night
So many tears
And crawlin' like a centiped
