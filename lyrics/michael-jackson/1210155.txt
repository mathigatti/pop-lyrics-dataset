Every night she walks Right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart


The girl is mine
(She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
(She like the way I rock, The way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)
I know she's mine
(She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)

I don't understand
The way you think
Saying that
She's yours not mine
Sending roses
And your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
(She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)
Don't waste your time
(Your time, don's waste your time, don't waste your time)
Because the doggone girl is mine
(She like the way I rock, The way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)

I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)

But I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)

So come and go with me
To one town

But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other

Don't build your hopes
To be let down
'Cause I really feel this time
That she'll tell you
I'm the one for her

'Cause she said
I blow her mind

The girl is mine
(She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
(She like the way I rock, The way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)
Don't waste your time
(Your time, don's waste your time, don'T waste your time)
Because the doggone girl is mine
(She like the way I rock, The way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)

(Will.I.Am):
She love the way
I love her low
The way I love her high
(Love her high)
She love to say hello
And never say goodbye
(Say goodbye)

I call her mommy
And she call me papa
I'm sorry Mike
But she love the way
I rock her

And you know, you know
You know I really care
(You know, you know
you know I care)
And she know, she know
The love is right here
And I know, I know
The love is real true
And now they know
They know just how
The Willie do

They like
The way I rock (8x)

The way I roll with it
The way I rock with it
The way I rock With king of pop
None stop with it

The way I rock
The way
The way I rock (3x)
I rock, I rock

Will.I.Am None stop
Rollin With the king of pop
MJ make it hot
Yeah, you like
The way i rock (8x)
