Uh oh, she's just your type right
Trying to figure out how you could play her
Made you brought up in her life right
Cuz shorty got a mind side
And every time you see her walk by
Stop thinking bout your night life
She all that's in your eyesight
And ever since the first day you seen her thinking she the white
type
You figure she'll be perfect loving you
Fantasize a single from her fingers rubbing you
Trying to analyze the situation
You feeling crazy
Wonderin' forever what's so special bout this lady
Feeling like you wanna pull back
But you know you perfect for her you got all of what them fools
lack
Maybe you should make this thing happen
Brandies and things swinging on the porch while the kids napping
You got everything else you need
Snatch her up fill that empty space she can make your life
complete


All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when I'm trying to
get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh I just wanna
touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

(Eve Rap) 
You like the way you stop the way that she got you hot
Excited said you need what she got
Enticing Mami like the cream of the crop
Pressure getting heavy bout to make your heart pop
All your life you waited for this chick
Nobody told you it'd feel like this
Do anything just to feel that kiss
Wanna give her whatever you got
In front of millions making on whatever the plot

If you would take my hand, baby I will show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
'Til the end of time

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
