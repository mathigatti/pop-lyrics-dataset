You're the one,
That I adore
Just kiss me once, I wanna know ya'
Don't know it.
Tell me things,
You ...
I do.
All the things I wanna saying,
Tell me things you are conveying,
All the (lies ?) you have to say
I do.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, babe.
Yesterday is when I fell down
You came my side to make sense
Of what I was around
....All to say
I do.


That's why I want to be
Free, free like the wind blow,
To fly away, just like a sparrow
To feel, letting my hair blow,
To take my time wherever I go.
I ....

You're the one,
That I adore
Just kiss me once I wanna know ya'
You feel the vibe
That I can fell in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of
All the things I feel
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Yesterday is when I fell down
I start tryin' to make sense
Of what I was around
Life is just a thing you don't (pass ?)
The way i do.

Because I want to be
Free, free like the wind blow,
To fly away, just like a sparrow

To feel, letting my hair blow,
To take my time wherever I go.
Free, free like the wind blow,
To fly away, just like a sparrow
To feel, letting my hair blow,
To take my time wherever I go.
I ...
Uh uh oh yeah, yeah.
Yesterday is when I fell down
I start tryin' to make sense
Of what I was around
You start tryin' to make the way to see
What's this thing i do.

Because I want to be
Free, free like the wind blow,
To fly away, just like a sparrow
To feel, letting my hair blow,
To take my time wherever I go.
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blow,
To fly away, just like a sparrow
To feel, letting my hair blow,
To take my time wherever I go.
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blow,
To fly away, just like a sparrow
To feel, letting my hair blow,
To take my time wherever I go.
Free, free like the wind blow,
To fly away, just like a sparrow
To feel, letting my hair blow,
To take my time wherever I go.
Got to be free.
