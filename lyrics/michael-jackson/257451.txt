I have seen love make men stagger
Praying their weakness and wound
Their pride
But you won't be touched by its dagger


When you're close by my side
If you'd only believe
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If you'd only believe
Ooh, ooh, ooh

What your love means to me
(And) I will climb with you the mountain
Sail the shining deep blue sea
'Til we find a place where we can go

Where a soul can be free
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If yo'd only believe
Ooh, ooh, ooh

What your love means to me
And if the skly comes
Tumbling down
Raining too hard for you to see
That's the time when you need

Someone around
And who's got a shoulder like me?
Can you tell me what you're feeling now
Open your heart so you can see
In this world there are so many ways

We can get what we need
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If you'd only believe
Ooh, ooh, ooh

What your love means to me
Why should the slky come
Falling down
Why should it rain on you and me
Just remember when you need
Someone around

Who loves you more than me?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If you'd only believe
Ooh, ooh, ooh
