She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean: I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round


She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed
Of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me: Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts
My mother always told me: Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth

The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told: My baby, we danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried
His eyes were like mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
But she came and stood right by me
Just to smell her sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No, she is not just my baby)
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
(You know what you did)
She says he is my son
(Breaking my heart, babe)
She says I am the one

The Billie Jean is not my lover
The Billie Jean is not my lover
The Billie Jean is not my lover
The Billie Jean is not my lover
(Call me, Billie Jean)
The Billie Jean is not my lover
(She is not at the scene)

The Billie Jean is not my lover
