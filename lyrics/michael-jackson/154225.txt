I watch the snowflakes fall
against my window plain
and wonder if you
are watchin snowflakes too
I take a walk downtown
to where you used to meet me
Theres joy everywhere
but all that waiting there is


[Chorus]
Just a little christmas tree
Lookin sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on christmas eve'

I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
and say a liitle prayer
you'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is

[Chorus]


This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me
(Why did you leave me)
(Why did you leave me)

[Chorus]
