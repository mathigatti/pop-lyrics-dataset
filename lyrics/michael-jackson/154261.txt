Love was taken from a young live
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dimlight
From one more violent crime
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die
Did God told you you could decide?
You saw he didn't run
And then my daddy had no gun


In the middle of the village
Within a distant land
Lies a cold boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand
He's awaken, ground is shaking
His father grabs his hand
Screaming crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain
He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
Why did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace why is there war?
Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids

When innocence is standing by
Watching people loosing lives
It seem as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice

Only God could decide
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done
If we raise our voice as one

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us

We can't take it
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us

We can't take it
We've already had enough

Thank God I care for me
Thank God I care for you
Thank God it came from you babe

We can't take it
We've already had enough

Deep in my soul baby
Deep in your soul and by your side
Deep in my soul
It's so big and I'm still alive
Did God hear it from us?
We can't take it
We've already had enough
It's going down baby
Just let God decide
It's going on baby
Just let God decide
Deep in my soul baby
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough
