[INTRO]
(We've got forever, forever)


[VERSE 1]
I'll plant you a garden
Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years
The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true

[CHORUS]
'cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few

[BRIDGE]
We shall have music
We shal have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time

[VERSE 2]
Then we'll add up the pleasures
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs
How lucky we are to be me and you

[CHORUS]
'cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few
