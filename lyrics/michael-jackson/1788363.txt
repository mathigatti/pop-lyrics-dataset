Ooh
She dances in the sheets at nights
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep


She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She dances for the men at work
Who works her all the time
She can't be rude and she says so
"I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of

She works so hard, just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop
Couldn't break his chains

She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home
Home

Ooh
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
Love, love, love
