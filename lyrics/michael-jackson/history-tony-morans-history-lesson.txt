HIStory

Keep, keep, keep, k-k-k-keep movin'

He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fire's deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Keep movin'
Keep movin'
Keep movin'
Keep, keep, keep, k-k-k-keep movin'

Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history (history)
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry (chivalry)
Every child should sing together in harmony

Keep movin'
Keep movin'
Keep movin'
Keep, keep, keep, k-k-k-keep movin'

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

Keep movin'

Keep movin' on higher ground

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
Before we learn to love our family
