(One?)


(Is there a clap that's supposed to be in here?)

Hot legs all into the room, she's got the
(One!)
(Hot keeper)
Netted stockings, purple panties that show
She's got
Fat lips, with a ring in her nose, she's got
Busted butts, all into the seat, she's got
I was thinkin' that she try to be mean

And the boy don't like it
And the boy don't want it
And the boy don't like it
And the boy don't want it

And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it
And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it

And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it
She Got It

(She got it, one, one, one, one)

Hot lips all up to her neck, she's got
Funky finger but she's giving him sex, she's got
Bad legs all into the truth, she's got
Such a feelin' but she's singin' the blues, she's got

Hot fix, eenie minee month, she doesn't play piano
But she did rock and roll

And the boy don't like it
And the boy don't like it
And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it

And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it
And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it

And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it
She Got It

(She got it, she got it,)

Too much for me now
Too much for me
That big momma dumbo
Too much for me, (oohh)

Hot legs all into the room, she's got
Musty water, hot cheaper perfume, she's got
Netted stockings, purple panties that show ,she's got
Bad lips, with a ring in her nose, she's got
Monkey busty all into the seat
She wants to be a movie star, she'd sell on tv

And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it
And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it

And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it
And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it

And the girl don't like it
And the boy don't want it
She Got It
She Got It

Too much for me now
Too much for me
And I really don't want it
Too much for me

That big momma dumbo
Too much for me, (hooo)
(Let me just look)
