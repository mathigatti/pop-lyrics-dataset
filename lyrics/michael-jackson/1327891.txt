See you out on the block with your man,
Got me on the stand
Girl why you hanging around
When he put you down
So i gotta put you up on me
'cause it's a shame
That girl you settle for less
When u know that im blessed



(hook)
You need to open up you're mind (you're mind)
Give me the chance to get inside (to get inside)


(chorus)
(i can i can)
Do it better than he can
(i will i will)
Be a bigger man
(i am i am)
Everthing you need and more
(can i can i)
Show you im a bigger man

Let me know
When he can't please you
I'll come right through
He'll give inches or for miles
I can make you smile
Cause i no that you
Might be afraid to walk away
But i'll protect you from him
So let the games began

Hook:
You need to open up your mind
(open up your mind)
Give me the chance to get inside
(to get inside)

(chorus)
(i can i can )
Do it better than he can
(i will i will)
Be a bigger man
(i am i am)
Everything you need and more
(can i can i)
Show you im a bigger man

(breakdown)
I know (i know)
For sure
That he can never measure up
Cause i got so much more
To give you
More

(chorus)
(i can i can)
Do it better
(i will i will)
Be a bigger man
(i am i am)
Everything you need and more
(can i can i)
Show you im a bigger man
(i can i can)
Do it better
(i will will)
Oh ay oh
(i am i am)
Yea
(can i can i)
Show you im a bigger man
Oh ay oh
