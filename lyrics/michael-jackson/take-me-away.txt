Take me some place different
Somewhere by the ocean
And not return to the city
And all its' bad emotion


I dont wanna live
I dont wanna live
In the rain no more

I just wanna go
I just wanna go
I here it's always warm

Come on and
Take me away

To where the sun is always shining
And the sky is always blue
I wanna live somewhere that's beautiful
And i wanna be there with you

We can leave this grey behind us
And start our life anew
Forget our work and daily life
Forever me and you

Take me some place different
I know i'm deep in love
Passion in the sunshine
Is what i'm thinking of

I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go
In to work no more

No one understands
Make stupid demands
I don't know what its for
Oh baby take me away

To where the sun is always shining
And the sky is always blue
I wanna live somewhere that's beautiful
And i wanna be there with you

We can leave this grey behind us
And start our life anew
Forget our work and daily life
Forever me and you

I want my baby
I want my baby with me
I want my baby
Tonight......
