All you got to do
Is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah


And all you got to do
Is not answer my calls
When I'm trying to get through
Keep me wondering why
When all I can do is sigh

I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

All I got  to say
Is that I must be dreaming
Can't be real
You're not here with me
Still but I can feel you near to me

I caress you
Let you taste us just so blissful listen
I would give you anything, baby
Just make my dreams come true

Oh baby, you give me butterflies

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(You give me)
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(You give me)
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

If you would take my hand
Baby, I would show you
Guide you to the light, baby

If you would be my love
Baby I will love you
Love you till the end of time

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(Girl, you give me)
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
