Father comes home from work and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he said what's going on
Mother cries desperatly, our little baby's gone!


Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of stepdaddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the streets
How will this girl survive
She ain't got nothing to eat

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Save me from this day now
Save me, 'cause i don't know what to do
Save me from that and a man
Save me from asking me
Save me from 'cause i don't wanna go
Save me, ooh

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She said she wanna be a star
She heard the money's good
She gets off at the train station
The man is waiting there
I'll show you where the money is
Girl, just let down your hair

He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body
Ha! Girl that will take you far
The police come out the corner
Somebody there told
He's arresting this little girl
She's only 12 years old

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
