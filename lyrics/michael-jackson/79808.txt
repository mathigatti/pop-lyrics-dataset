Ah, on the floor and dance
Ah, on the floor and dance
So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake your thing
Especially


There's a chance for dancin'
All night long
There's a chance for groovin'
And it will be soothing with a song

Then why don't you just
Dance across the floor
'Cause there's a chance for chances
And the chance is choosin'
And I sure would like just to groove with you

So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake your thing
Especially
So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake that thing (girl)
Especially

No need for rejection
Determined to be
Gonna groove, gonna move ya
Gonna says things to ya
Just wait and see

Then why don't you just
Dance across the floor
'Cause there's a chance for choices
And it's you I'm choosin'
And I sure would like just to groove with you

So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake your thing
Especially

Get up won't you g'on get down
Shake your body, won't you g'on get down
Get up won't you g'on get down
Shake your body, won't you g'on get down

So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake your thing
