Uh huh alright

This time gonna do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side
Hold on


Shelter come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold I need someone
Oh why oh why why why

If you see her
Tell her this for me
All I need is

One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(See)
(One more)

One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
(Alright)
One more chance at love

Searching for that one who is going to make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold
Hold on

Lightning about to strike in rain only on me
Hurt so bad sometimes it's hard to breathe
Oh why why

If you see her
Tell her this for me
All I need is

One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more chance for love)

One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love

And I would walk around this world to find her
And I don't care what it takes no
Why

I'd sail the seven seas to be near her
And if you happen to see her
See, tell her this for me

One more chance at love
(Yeah, Yeah)
One more chance at love
(Tell her this from me)
One more chance at love
(Yeah, Yeah)
One more chance at love

One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(Loving you)
One more chance at love
(I can't find)
One more chance at love
(Loving you)

One more chance at love
(Yeah one more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(For love)
One more chance at love

One more chance at love
(Yeah I can't stop)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(Loving you)
One more chance at love

One more chance at love
(I can't stop)
One more chance at love
(Loving you)
(Aaow)
One more chance at love
(I can't stop)
One more chance at love
