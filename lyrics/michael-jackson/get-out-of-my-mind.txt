They used to tell me
Made a race against the time
Brother can spare a dime
Just waiting for the bread
At once i go to work
Cause no one else is old
I find my peace at place
Cause there s nothing inside


Bring me back in the street
Get out of my mind
I feel too better than down
All right, all right
Get out of my mind
And let me change
You re mine

They used to tell me
It's always headline
Just waiting for the bread
One side we built red road
One side we built it down
But now we break in time
Brother can spare a dime
For yankees do all of time
It wasn't all this time
Sister remind me,
Come all the time
Say don t remember
I but you can't spare a dime
You don't have to wear
Just waiting for the bread
One side we built red road
One side we built it down
But now we break in time
Brother can spare a dime
For yankees do all of time
