stop!na na na!you'd better save it!
stop,stop,stop,you better save it!


when we played in tag grade school
you wanted to be it
but chasing boys was just a fad
you crossed your heart you'd quit
when we grew up you traded
you promise for my ring
but just like back to grade school
you're doing the same old thing!

CHOROUS:
stop!the love you save may be your own!
darling take it slow or some day you'll be all alone
you'd better stop the love you save may be your own!
darling look both way before you cross me
you're haded for the danger zone

i'm the one who loves you!
i'm the one you need!
those other guys
will put you down
as soon as they suceed!
they'll ruin you reputation!
they'll label you a flirt!
the way they talk about you
they'll turn your name to dirt,oh!

isaac said he kissed you
beneath the apple tree
when Benjie held your hand he felt
e-le-tri-ce-tee!
when Alexander called you
he said he rang your chimes
christopher discovered
you're way ahed of your times!
