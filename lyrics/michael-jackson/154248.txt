(Too Good To Be True)

Moonlight took me by surprise
'light coming from your eyes
Are you with me
Am I here with you
Are we in paradise
Tell me I'm not dreamin'


I know I've been here before
You go, then you come back for more
It's a mystery how you disappear
Like a shadow in the night
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

Chorus:
Are you too good to be true
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
Are you too good to be true
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

Midnight images of you
You slipped, slipped into my room
Could be magic, could be fantasy
Could it be that we're in love
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

Your voice whispers in the dark
You talk, talking to my heart
Are you with me
Am I here with you
Are we in paradise
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

(Chorus)

When the morning comes
Wake me with your love
Let me know that I'm not dreamin'
Tell me this is real
Show me how you feel
Say it's what we both believe in

(Chorus)
