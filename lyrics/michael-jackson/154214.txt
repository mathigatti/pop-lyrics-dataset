Your givin me true love
And everyday I thank the lord
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting so exciting


Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine, still I need a path because
I'm lost in a world
Made for you and me
Oooh... 

Baby, Baby
I hear a symphony
Ooooh... baby

Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Played sweet and tenderly
Everytime your lips meet mine, my baby

Baby, baby
I feel the joy begin
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now baby

Baby, baby
Those tears that filled my eyes
I cried not for myself
But for those who have never felt the joy of love

Baby, baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak of me
I hear a tender note so sweet of love

Baby, baby
As you stand there holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now

Baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
So close to me my baby, baby, baby

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
I hear a symphony
