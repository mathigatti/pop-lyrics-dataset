Chorus:
I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places


I want to go
To a different land
Try my best
To understand
The different traditions
And customs
That people have

The world is bigger
Than this ole town
I wanna get my feet up
Off the ground
I've saved up my money
And I'm leavin' here today
'Cause....

Chorus:
I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places

I want to get
A first class seat
Climbing to a high of forty feet
It don't take long
To get where you wanna go

I'm gonna have myself a ball
This ole world I wanna see it all
I got my clothes packed
And I'm leaving right away
