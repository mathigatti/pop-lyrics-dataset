Girl, there's a better way
I'm talkin' about me and you
You sittin' around with a long face
Thinkin' up nothing to do


And girl, there's a better way
I'm talkin' about doin' the do
You're killin' time there's a better way
Than sittin' around being blue

Don't you know there are better things to do

Work that body
All that body
Work that body
Everybody

Work that body
All that body
Work that body
Ooh

Time to get to know me
Knowin' that nothing to do
You're walking in line at your wrong place
Someone put a spell on you

You know, I don't wanna
I only wanna be with you
But two times two means nothin' to you
'cause you ain't got nothin' to do

Don't you know there are better things to do

Work that body
All that body
Work that body
Everybody

Work that body
All that body
Work that body
Everybody

Work that body
All that body
Work that body
Everybody

Sit down girl
I think I love you
No, get up girl
Show me what you can do!

Everybody
Suspicious
Condition
Pretentious
Admission
Persuasion
Invasion
Ooh

Work that body
All that body
Work that body
Everybody

Work that body
All that body
Work that body
Everybody
