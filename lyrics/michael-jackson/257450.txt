Looking over my photographs 
I saw a picture of you and me Lovin' baby 
I had to write to just to tell you that 
And to find out if you really love missin' me 
Cuz if you don't love me 
If you don't love me 
If you don't love me 
If you don't need me, just like I need me 
If you don't love me 
If you don't love me 
If you don't love me 
What will I do baby? 
Cuz I'm in love with you 
I told the doctor that I got a broken heart 
And my temperature has risen to 103 
Why don't you write me back and save me girl? 
Tell me what I wanna hear Like your missin' me 
But if you don't love me 
If you don't love me 
If you don't need me 
If you don't want me the way I want you 
If you don't love me 
If you don't love me Cuz I'm in love with you 
You! Baby baby I've been missing you 
It was such a long long time ago 
You changed your number and couldn't call you 
So I couldn't steal your soul 
I had to write you just to tell you that 
I may be kissing on your photograph 
If you don't love me 
If you don't love me 
If you don't love me 
Baby baby, give it to me 
If you don't love me 
If you don't love me 
Then I don't love you 
If you don't love me 
If you don't need me 
Give it to me baby 
Give it to me baby 
Love me Bring it to my bed I 
f you don't love me 
I really gotta have it 
If you don't love me 
You know what I'm gonna do? 
If you dont love me 
If you don't love me 
If you don't want mye 
I'm taking my pride 
Give it to me baby 
If you don't want me 
If you don't need me Still, give it to me baby 
If you don't love me 
If you don't love me 
If you don't want me 
Aowww!
