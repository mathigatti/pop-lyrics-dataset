Whether I'm right or whether I'm wrong
Whether I find a place in this world or never belong
I've gotta be me, I've gotta be me
What else can I be but what I am?


I want to live, not merely survive
And I won't give up this dream of life that keeps me alive
I've gotta be me, I've gotta be me
The dreams that I see makes me what I am

That far away prize, a world of success
Is waiting for me if I heed the call
I won't settle down, won't settle for less
As long as there's a chance that I can have it all

I'll done it alone, that's how it must be
I can't be right for somebody else if I'm not right for me
I've gotta be free, I've gotta be free
Daring to try, to do it or die I've gotta be me

I'll done it alone, that's how it must be
I can't be right for somebody else if I'm not right for me
I've gotta be free, I've gotta be free
Daring to try, to do it or die I've gotta be me
