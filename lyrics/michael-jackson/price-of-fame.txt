I took my baby on a river boat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited about the way the things could have been
As in if I don’t care


I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise
Someone called my name
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab
My joy had turned to pain

Father always told me: You won’t live a quiet life
If you’re reaching for fortune and fame
I fell the pressure setting in
I’m living just to win; I’m down in my pain
Don’t you fell’ no pain?

It’s the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don’t be feelin’ no pain
It’s the price of fame, it’s the price of fame
So don’t you ever complain?

I’m a cover of a magazine, watch the scene
They know my every do’s
Just sign your name on the dotted line, you’ll be fine
That always bothers me

Get in your car; you wanna take a ride, look behind
Someone is following you
You try to get away you turn real fast, but too bad
They know you every move

Father always told me: You won’t live a quiet life
If you’re reaching for fortune and fame
I fell the pressure setting in
I’m living just to win, I bleed all this pain
Don’t you ever complain?

It’s the price of fame; you pay the price of fame
So don’t you ever complain?
It’s the price of fame, it’s the price of fame
So don’t be fellin’ no pain?

It’ the price of fame (price of fame)
You pay the price of fame (price of fame)
Father never lies
My father never lies (price of fame)
My father never lies (price of fame)
So don’t be feelin’ this way, boy

I’d like to take sometime and get away, then they’ll say
Is that the boy still alive? 
They make you start taking pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive
Father always told me: You won’t live a quiet life
They start to wonderin’ where have you been
I feel their envious looks at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Then stand here in my shoes
And get a taste of my blues

It’s the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don’t you ever complain?
It’s the price of fame, it’s the price of fame
So don’t be fellin’ this way?

It’s the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don’t you ever complain?

It’ the price of fame (price of fame)
You pay the price of fame (price of fame)
Father never lies
My father never lies, baby (price of fame)
My father never lies (price of fame)
So don’t be feelin’ don’t pain’, boy
