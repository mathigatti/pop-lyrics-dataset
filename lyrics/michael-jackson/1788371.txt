Cause this time of ours is borrowed
We must give a helping hand
Whatever happen to our heroes
They must get another chance
(We can do it again)


We drove close, closer and closer
And even though we're almost there

You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes imagine I'm taking you away
Tonight

Come together all the people (we can do it now)
Here's your chance to make it right (go, take a chance)
And even though (and even though) we're gettin' close (gettin' close)
We're not there just yet
And even though we're almost there

You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes imagine I'm taking you away
Then one more time close your eyes
I'm always here to stay
(oh I)
Tonight

(I'm always here)
(Oh I)
(I'm always here)
We can do it again
(I'm always here)
