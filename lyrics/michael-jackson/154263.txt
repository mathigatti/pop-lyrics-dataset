How many people will have to die before we will take a stand?
How many children will have to cry, before we do
All we can?
If sending your love is all you can give
To help one live


How many times can we turn our heads
And pretend we cannot see
Healing the wounds of our broken earth
We are one global family
Just sending your prayers
Is something you'll feel
Helping one heal

What have I got that I can give?
(What have I got that I can give?
(Tell me)
What have I got that I can give?
To love and to teach you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give?

Now let's rather lay down our fears and reach out and make a pact
Show him the love that is in our hearts let us bring salvation back
Just sending your love has the power to heal
So let's all give

What have I got that I can give?
(Is not allowed to give just a little bit)
What have I got that I can give?
(Everyone should be a part of it)
To love and to teach you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give?

Say the words
I'll lay me down for you
Just call my name
I am your friend
See, then why do they keep teaching us
Such hate and cruelty?
We should give over and over again

What have I got that I can give?
(We should give over and over again!)
What have I got that I can give?
(Oh my God, oh my God)
(Oh my Lord)

See, to love and to teach you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give?
What have I got that I can give?
What have I got that I can give?
(Give you, give to you)

See, to love and to teach you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give?
What have I got that I can give?

(What More Can I give?)
What have I got that I can give?
(I wanna give to you, give it to you)
See, to love and to teach you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give
(They think I'm crazy but I'm not!)

What have I got that I can give?
(To give it to you)
(We wanna give to you!)
What have I got that I can give?

To hold and conceal you
To love and to heal you
What more can I give?
(Give me, give me one time more)
What have I got that I can give?

(What I got, what have I got)
(Say your prayers)
What have I got that I can give?
(Show the world how much you really care)
To love and to teach you
(To love you, teach you)
To hold and to need you
(To hold you, to need you)
(What more?)
What more can I give?

What have I got that I can give?
(What can I give? Tell me what can I give you)
What have I got that I can give?

To hold and conceal you
To love and to heal you
What more can I give?
