You laughed at me, you made me cry
You made a joke, then wonder why
(I am a loser) (I am a loser)
I say, "Hello", you say, "Goodbye"
I reach to you, you don't even try
(I am a loser) (I am a loser)


If losing you makes me happy
Then why does it makes me cry
Losing you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die

I'm born to lose, you know it's true
And here I stand, I'm losing you
(I am a loser) (I am a loser)
You are the one to let me know
You needed me, now I have to go
(I am a loser), alright (I am a loser)

If losing you makes me happy
Then why does it makes me cry
Losing you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die (ever die)

I am a fool, you know it's true
I believed in you, now you don't even try
(I am a loser), alright (I am a loser)
What kind of foolish guy am I
You break my heart, I wonder why
(I am a loser), alright (I am a loser)

(I am a loser) alright
(I am a loser) alright
(I am a loser) baby
(I am a loser) alright
(I am a loser) baby
(I am a loser) alright
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser) alright, alright
(I am a loser) one time, alright
(I am a loser) let me win one time, alright
(I am a loser) I gotta win, I gotta win, I can't lose
Don't talk about this one time, please
(I am a loser) on my begging knees, on my begging knees
(I am a loser) ooo-ooo, alright
(I am a loser) hee hee
(I am a loser) I am a loser, baby
(I am a loser) I am a loser, baby
(I am a loser) I am a loser, uh
(I am a loser) I am a loser, baby
(I am a loser) I am a loser, baby
(I am a loser) I am a loser
(I am a loser) let me win one time, let me win one time
(I am a loser) alright, hee
(I am a loser)

(I am a loser)
Goodbye to you, goodbye to thee
(I am a loser)
Goodbye to you, hello world
(I am a loser)
Maybe tomorrow, maybe today
Who knows who will win
(I am a loser)
