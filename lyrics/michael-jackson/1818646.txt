There comes a time,
When we head a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all


We can't go on
Pretending day by day
That someone, somehow will soon make a change
We are all a part of
God's great big family
And the truth, you know love is all we need
(Michael Jackson)
We are the world
We are the children

We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making,
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
Send them your heart,
So they'll know that someone cares

So there cries for help
Will not be in vein
We can't let them suffer
No we cannot turn away
Right now they need a helping hand
Nou se mond la
We are the Children

We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

When you're down and out
There seems no hope at all
But if you just believe
There's no way we can fall
Well, well, well, well, let us realize
That a change can only come
When we stand together as one

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
Got to start giving

There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
We are the world
We are the children

Its for the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
Choice were making
saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We all need somebody that we can lean on
When you wake up look around and see that your dreams gone
When the earth quakes we'll help you make it through the storm
When the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
We are the World united by love so strong
When the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road your walking on
A sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
We are the World connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet sing it along

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me
