What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain


What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine

Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uuh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uuh

What have we've done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son
What about flowering fields
Is there a time

What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, theses weeping shores

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uuh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uuh

Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uuh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uuh
