There's indication
That someone's up standing on the ground (?)
Across the nation
There's always deep trying to put you down (?)


Now is the time
For us to spend this evening close together... yeah
Deep in the night
We're holding on to someone else's dream
Girl can't you see

We need some starlight
Starlight sun
There ain't no second chance
We got to make it right again
We need starlight
Some starlight sun
I need you by my side to give me
Starlight, starlight, starliiiiight...

They're out to get you
There ain't no (?)
Love came possess you
And make you see that how we're gonna do it

High in the night
This magic's gonna keep us close together
We'll start to fly
God this is the beginning of your life
Deep in the night

Give some starlight
Starlight sun
This is the only chance
We got to make it right again
Give me the starlight
Starlight sun
I need you by my side
So give me
Starlight, starlight, starliiiiight...

Light up the world
And the love start to shine in this mascal way
Take every (?) and show me that this is your light
Give me your starlight tonight

There's indication
That someone's up standing on the ground (?)
Across the nation
There's always deep trying to put you down (?)
