I try to do what's right for me
But no one sees the way I see
And then I try to please them so
But how far can this pleasing go


Somethings soon to come over you
You just can't please the world and yourself
You gotta start doing whats right for you
Cause life is being happy yourself

Then you should bless his soul
It's hard to find
A person like you
You're one of a kind
If I were you, I'd change my mind
And start living for me in these changing times

Sometimes I cry cause I'm confused
Is this a fact of being used
There is no life for me at all
Cause I give myself at beck and call

Somethings soon to come over you
You just can't please the world and yourself
You gotta start doing what's right for you
Cause life is being happy yourself

Then you should bless his soul
It's hard to find
A person like you
You're one of a kind
If I were you, I'd change my mind
And start living for me in these changing times

The life you're leading is so dangerous
It's so dangerous, dangerous all
The life you're leading is so dangerous
Doggone dangerous, dangerous, dangerous

Somethings soon to come over you
You just can't please the world and yourself
You gotta start doing what's right for you
'Cause life is being happy yourself

Then you should bless his soul
It's hard to find
A person like you
You're one of a kind
People will cry
If rain or sun
Try to please all
And you've pleased none
