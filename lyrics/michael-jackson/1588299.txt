I can't wait to get to school each day
And wait for you to pass my way
(And bells start to ring) and angels start to sing
Hey that's the girl for you (ooh, yeah)
So what are you gonna do (ooh, baby)
Hey little girl I love you so (I love you so)


All I do is think of you
Day and night that's all I do (that's all I do, baby)
I can't get you off my mind
Think about you all the time, all the time

I begun to take the long way home
Just so I can be alone
(To think of how to say)
You're fine in every way
Hey I'm in love with you (oh, I love you baby)
I think the world of you (ooh, yes I do)
Oh, won't you please, please be mine

All I do is think of you
Baby day and night that's all I do
I can't get you off my mind
Think about you all the time, all the time, ooh

(Girl you're so doggone fine)
Baby I love you
Think the world of you, ooh
Day and night that's all I do
Ooh baby, can't get you off my mind
I've been dreaming about you (I've been dreaming about you)
Oh baby, I keep thinking about you
All night long, oh
