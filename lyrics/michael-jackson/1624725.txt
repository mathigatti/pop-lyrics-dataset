Just another song
Of trying to change heal our world
At times I think that's all that this would be
But I must remain strong
Gotta do all I can do
Cause I know my God hasn't given up on me
And the children
Born so innocent and free
Is the gift of life still the greatest gift of all
And the homeless
With no clothes and food to eat
We've got to do much better
Cause we're all in this together
What will it take, to make, the world
A better place, you and I know that we
Have gotta change, what will it take
For us to make that change, what will it take
What will it take, to make, the world
A better place, you and I know that we
Have gotta change, what will it take
For you to make that change
Just a little more love
And care for our whole world
I think that's just about all that we'll need
But we gotta stay strong, strong
Gotta give all we can give
And a better place we'll live in guarantee, say
What will it take, what will it take, what will it take
What will it take
What will it take, we've gotta change, let's make that change
For the children
Born so innocent and free
Cause the gift of life is the greatest gift of all
And the homeless
With no clothes or food to eat
If we all just pull together
Then we'd live in peace forever
What will it take, to make, the world
A better place, you and I know that we
Have gotta change, what will it take
For us to make that change, what will it take
What will it take, to make, the world
A better place, you and I know that we
We've gotta change
Have gotta change, what will it take
For you to make that change
What will it take, what will it take, what will it take
What will it take
What will it take, we've gotta change, let's make that change
For the children
Born so innocent and free
Cause the gift of life is the greatest gift of all
And the homeless
With no clothes and food to eat
If we'd all just pull together
Then we'd live in peace forever
What will it take, to make, the world
A better place, you and I know that we
Have gotta change, what will it take
For us to make that change, what will it take
What will it take, to make, the world
A better place, you and I know that we
We've gotta change
Have gotta change, what will it take
For you to make that change
What will it take, to make, the world
What will it take
A better place, you and I know that we
We've gotta change
Have gotta change, what will it take
Let's make that change
For us to make that change, what will it take
What will it take, to make, the world
A better place, you and I know that we
Have gotta change, what will it take
For you to make that change
What will it take, to make, the world
A better place, you and I know that we
Have gotta change, what will it take
For us to make that change, what will it take
What will it take, to make, the world
A better place, you and I know that we
Have gotta change, what will it take
For you to make that change
What will it take, to make, the world
A better place, you and I know that we
Have gotta change, what will it take
For us to make that change, what will it take
What will it take, to make, the world
A better place, you and I know that we
Have gotta change, what will it take
For you to make that change
Ad lib fade
