You take sugar and spice
Everything nice
And you got a little girl, yeah, yeah
You take snakes and snails
Some puppy dog tails
And you got a little boy, yeah, yeah
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of
Snakes, snails, puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice, everything nice
Yeah, yeah, all right
Something else to do



You take a walk by the sea
Two hearts on a tree
And you got a little gladness, yeah, yeah
Blue eyes cry
Two hearts say goodbye
And you got a little sadness, yeah, yeah
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of
Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Hearts on a tree
Walk by a sea
Snakes, snails, puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice, everything nice
Yeah, yeah, all right


One more thing
You take a cruel word spoken
Pride gets broken
And you got a little break up, yeah, yeah
You take a little bit of soul
Sweet words being told
And you got a little make up, yeah, yeah
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of


Words being told
With a little bit of soul
Pride gets broken
Cruel words spoken
Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Hearts on a tree
Walk by the sea
Snakes, snails, puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice, everything nice
Yeah, yeah, all right


Listen everybody
Yeah, yeah, all right
