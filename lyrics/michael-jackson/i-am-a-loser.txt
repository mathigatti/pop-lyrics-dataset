You laughed at me
You made me cry
You made a joke
Then wonder why
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)


I say hello
You say goodbye
I reach to you
You don't even try
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)

If losing you makes me happy
Then why does it make me cry?
Losing you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die?

I'm born to lose
You know it's true
And here I stand
I'm losing you
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)

You are the one to let me know
You needed me, now I have to go
(I am a loser) alright
(I am a loser)

If losing you makes you happy
Then why does it make me cry?
If losing you makes me your winner
Then how did our love ever die? (ever die?)

I am a fool
You know it's true
I believed in you
Now you don't even try
(I am a loser) alright
(I am a loser) aaa-aah

What foolish kind
Of guy am I?
You break my heart
I wonder why
