In the news today, from the strange and weird fact file
Singer Michael Jackson sleeps in an oxygen chamber
The singer says that the hyperbaric chamber has the benefit of reversing
The aging process


Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
It's the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
It's the blackmail story in all your glory

It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it
And you don't have to eat it
To buy it is to feed it
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
You see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual

In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses
Damn self righteousness
In the black
Stab me in the back
In the face
To lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
It's the headline story of
All your glory

It's slander
With the words you use
You're parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it
And they don't glorify it
To read it sanctifies it
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves

(Baby)
Just because you read it in a magazine
(Baby)
You see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
You see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, and everybody wants to believe all about it

Just because you read it in a magazine
Believe me
Or see it on the TV screen
(Baby)
Don't make it factual
(Baby)
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Baby
Just because you read it in a magazine
(Baby)
You see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual

Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it
And they don't glorify it
To read it sanctifies it
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Slander
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen you torture men
But why do we keep foolin' ourselves

(Baby)
Just because you read it in a magazine
(Baby)
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
(Baby)
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
You see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to read all about it

(Baby)
Just because you read it in a magazine
(Baby)
You see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
You see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
(Gotta believe)

Just because you read it in a magazine
You see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
You're so damn disrespectable
