I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of may


Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl, my girl
Talking about my girl, my girl

I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song, yeah
Than the birds in the trees

Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl, my girl
Talking about my girl, my girl

Ooh, oh, oh, oh
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Hey, hey, hey
Do, do, do, do, do, do

I love my baby
She makes me feel proud
I climb the highest mountain
And say it out loud

I don't need no money, yeah
Fortune or fame
I´ve got all the riches, baby
One man can claim

Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl, my girl
Talking about my girl, my girl

Do, do, do, do, do, do

I’ve got sunshine
On a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of may
With my girl, my girl
Talking about my girl
My girl
My girl
