She's a PYT (a pretty young thing)
But you're the PYT (she's a pretty young thing)


I was upstairs, she came and woke me
I was asleep and tired
She came inside, my primadona
The girl is my heavenly prize

The girl's a...
The girl's a P
The girl's a Y
The girl's a T
The girl's a... She is just the one, right

The girl's a PYT (my pretty young things)
PYT (pretty young thing)

[Will. I. Am:]
Damn girl you a sexy thang
Let me be your lil' sex machine
Cause you lookin' really cute in them jeans
I'll peel 'em off like a tangerine
I can see you in the magazines
Modeling Maybelline
Yeah you can be my beauty queen
Yeah boo, let me be your king... yes

The girl's a...
The girl's a P
The girl's a Y
The girl's a T
The girl's a... she is just the one, right

The girls a PYT (pretty young things)
PYT (pretty young thing)

[Will. I. Am:]
Pretty young things repeat after me
Say na na na na na na

[Chorus x2]

[Will. I. Am:]
It's the king of beats
Rollin' with the king of pop
Will.I.am non-stop
MJ on top
