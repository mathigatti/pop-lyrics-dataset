Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait


You're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so

You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you, girl, it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on
So every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me? I'd tell them no

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh
Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Just leave us alone, leave us alone
Please leave us alone
