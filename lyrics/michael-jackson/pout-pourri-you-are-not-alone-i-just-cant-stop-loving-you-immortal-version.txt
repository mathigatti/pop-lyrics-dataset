Another day has gone I'm still all alone
How could this be you're not here with me
You never said goodbye someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold


Everyday I sit and ask myself how did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone I am here with you
Though you're far away I am here to stay
But you are not alone I am here with you
Though we're far apart you're always in my heart
But you are not alone... lone lone why lone

Each Time The Wind Blows
I Hear Your Voice So
I Call Your Name . . .
Whispers At Morning
Our Love Is Dawning
Heaven's Glad You Came . . .
You Know How I Feel
This Thing Can't Go Wrong
I'm So Proud To Say
I Love You
Your Love's Got Me High
I Long To Get By
This Time Is Forever
Love Is The Answer

(Siedah)
I Hear Your Voice Now
You Are My Choice Now
The Love You Bring
Heaven's In My Heart
At Your Call
I Hear Harps,
And Angels Sing

You Know How I Feel
This Thing Can't Go Wrong
I Can't Live My Life
Without You

(Michael)
I Just Can't Hold On

(Siedah)
I Feel We Belong

(Michael)
My Life Ain't Worth Living
If I Can't Be With You

(Juntos)
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
And If I Stop . . .
Then Tell Me Just What
Will I Do

(Siedah)
I Just Can't Stop Loving You

(Michael)
Noche de estrellas
Haz que me quiera
Como a ella yo

(Siedah)
De madrugada
Ven que te espera
Todo mi amor

(Michael)
Soy joven, lo sé
Pero siento que
Te quiero y solo vivo por ti

(Siedah)
Me conoces bien
Y sabes también
Que yo no puedo
Vivir sin tu amor

(Juntos)
Todo mi amor eres tú (Ooh)
Todo mi amor eres tú
Cuando no estás
No hay quien me dé
Lo que das tú

(Michael)
I Just Can't Stop Loving You

(Siedah)
We Can Change All The World
Tomorrow

(Michael)
We Can Sing Songs Of
Yesterday

(Siedah)
I Can Say, Hey . . .Farewell
To Sorrow

(Michael)
This Is My Life And I,

(Juntos)
Want To See You For Always
I Just Can't Stop Loving You

(Siedah)
No, Baby

(Michael)
Oh!

(Both)
Pues todo mi amor lo eres tú

(Juntos)
And If I Stop . . .

(Michael)
Oh! Oh! Oh . . .Oh . . .

(Siedah)
What Will I Do? Uh . . .Ooh . . .

(Both)
I Just Can't Stop Loving You

(Michael)
Hee! Hee! Hee! Know I Do
Girl!

(Both)
Pues todo mi amor lo eres tú

(Michael)
You Know I Do
And If I Stop . . .

(Juntos)
Then Tell Me, Just What
Will I Do

(Michael)
I Just Can't Stop Loving You

Remember The Time
Remember The Time
Remember The Time
