Put your arms around me child, 
Like when you bumped your shin; 
Then you'll know I love you now, 
As I loved you then 
Though you may be trying sometimes, 
And I'll need you and you're not there; 
You know I may get mad and turn away, 
But you know that I still care 


But you cannot ask for me, 
Than can come from me; 
I am older than you are, 
And one day you'll see 

If I lose my patience with you, 
And I suddenly start to scream; 
It's only because I just want you to be 
Everything I see in my dreams 

Chorus : 
And I'd like to know it's there, 
The feeling that we have, 
When you know that you can come running to me, 
Whenever times are bad 

Don't lose the feeling that we have 
Don't lose the feeling that we have 

Though you're growing older now, 
And I'm watching you grow; 
I know I make you sad sometimes, 
And I see your feelings show. 
But one day I'll look around, 
And you will be grown; 
You'll be out in the world, 
Such a pretty girl, 
But you'll be on your own 

Chorus : 
And I'd like to know it's there, 
The feeling that we have; 
Knowing that you can come to me 
Whenever you are sad 

Child, I'd like to know it's there, 
The feel that we have- 
Don't lose the feeling that we have. 
Don't lose the feeling that we have
