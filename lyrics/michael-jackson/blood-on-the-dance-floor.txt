Alone tonight
Me here tonight
Till it's all right
Damn lover friend of mine


She got your number, she know your game
She put you under, it's so insane
Since you seduced her, how does it feel
To know that woman is out to kill?

Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number, and Susie says it's right

Susie says it's, Su-Su says it's
(Take my-take my money)
Susie got your, Su-Susie got your
(Throw my time away)
Blood is on, is on, blood is
(You've been talking garbage)
The dance floor, the dance the night
(You're damn, damn good for me)

I never knew, but I was walking the line
Come, go with me, I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried, she left me standing alone

Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
This is Heartbreak Hotel, it's so evil
Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

10 years ago today
Dangerous, and Susie ain’t your friend
Dangerous, with seven inches in
Dangerous, blood is on the knife
Dangerous, and Susie says it's right

A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart

So just leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Stop it, just stop dogging me around

It was blood on the dance floor, to enjoy that simple dance
It was blood on the dance floor, everything was on my side
It was blood on the dance floor, like it was love and true romance
It was blood on the
And I just can't take it, the girl won't break it

You've been, you've been, you don't, you don't, don't
You don't, you don't, don't mess with my baby
She don't, she don't, she don't know it
She just, she just, mess with my baby
