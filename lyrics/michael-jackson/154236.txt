Chorus:
Never can say goodbye
No no no no, I
Never can say goodbye


Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no...

Tell me why
Is it so

That I
Never can say goodbye
No no no no, I
Never can say goodbye

Evertime I think I had enough
I start heading for the door 
There's a very strange vibration
That pushes me right to the core
It says turn around you foole
You know you love her more and more


Tell me why
Is it so
Don't wanna let yo go

(Instrumental)

(Chorus)

I keep thinkin that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling and there's that anguish,
there's that doubt
*It's that same old dizzy hang up
*Can't live with you or without

Tell me why
Is it so
Don't wanna let you go

(Chorus)

(Repeat till fade)
