It was on a street so evil
So bad that even hell disowned it
Every single step was trouble
For the fool who stumbled on it
Eyes within the dark were watchin'
I felt the sudden chill of danger
Something told me keep on walkin'
Told me I should not have gone there


Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife (ooh)
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
'Cause I just can't stop this feeling
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture (ooh)

She was up a stair to nowhere
A room forever I'll remember
She stared as though I should have known her
Tell me what's your pain or pleasure
Every little thing you find here
Is simply for the thrill you're after
Loneliness or hearts on fire
I am here to serve all masters

She said: Reality is a knife
When there's no love in your life
Unmerciful is the night
When you just can't stop this feeling
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

And I still can't find the meaning, no
No, no, of the face I keep on seeing
Was she real or am I dreaming
Did the sound of your name
Turn a wheel
Start a flame in me (ooh)

Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
And I just can't stop this feeling
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

She said: Reality is a knife
When there's no love in your life
Unmerciful is the night
When you just can't stop this feeling
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture
