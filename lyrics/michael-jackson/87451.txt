Ain't the pictures enough
Why do you go through so much
To get the story you need
So you can bury me


You've got the people confused
You tell the stories you choose
You try to get me to lose
The man I really am

You keep on stalking me
Invading my privacy
Won't you just let me be

Cause you cameras can't control
The minds of those who know
That you'll even sell your soul
Just to get a story sold

I need my privacy (Yeah, yeah)
I need my privacy (Yeah, yeah)
So paparazzi (Yeah, yeah)
Get away from me (Yeah, yeah)

Some of you still wonder
Why one of my friends had to die
To get a message across
That yet you haven't heard

My friend was chased and confused
Like many others I knew
But on that cold winter night
My pride was snatched away

Now she get no second chance
She just ridiculed and harassed
Please tell me why

No there's a lesson to learn
Respect's not given, it's earned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity

I need my privacy (Yeah, yeah)
I need my privacy (Yeah, yeah)
So paparazzi (Yeah, yeah)
Just get away from me (Yeah, yeah)

Now there's a lesson to learn
Stories are twisted and turned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity

I need my privacy (Yeah, yeah)
I need my privacy (Yeah, yeah)
So paparazzi (Yeah, yeah)
Get away from me (Yeah, yeah)
