[VERSE 1]
Ooh baby now, I've been watchin' you girl
When you dance you steal the show
Just like you steal my heart...
When the lights were low
All the guys are waiting
pleading just to squeeze you tight
Oh, darling no no no please not tonight


Cuz now you're in my arms girl, you thrill my soul
C'mon hold me close
Rock me slow
Baby never let me go

[CHORUS]
Oh, baby make tonight all mine
I can make you happy
Jjust gimme a try
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time
Make tonight all mine
(Baby I...)
Can satisfy you
Gonna 'lectrify you
C'mon let me prove it
Show you I can do it

[VERSE 2]
I've been walkin' like a shadow,
Right behind you by myself
While you've been walking home
With someone else
Don't you know it hurts me,
Seeing you with other guys
Oh, darling no no no please not tonight

When the party's over, let me walk you home
I'll hold you close
Rock you slow
Never, never let you go

[CHOURS]
Oh, baby make tonight all mine
I can make you happy
Just gimme a try
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time
Make tonight all mine
(Baby I...)
Oh, all, all mine, mine, mine, mine yeah &lt;ad libs&gt;
