Lonely teardrops, my pillow nerver dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, say you will
My heart is cryin', cryin'


Just give me another chance for a romance
Come on and tell me when do you return
'Cause everybody that you been gone away
You know my heart does nothin' but burn, cry

Lonely teardrops, my pillow nerver dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, say you will
My heart is cryin', cryin'
