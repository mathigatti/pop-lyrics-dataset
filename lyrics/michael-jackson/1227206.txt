People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth


(Kanye)
Yeah, Ah, Ahã

(MJ)
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Chorus:
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)

She told my baby that's a threat
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
Eyes would like mine
Gonna dance on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Chorus:
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

(Kanie)
Ahã
Yeah we hear
Number One

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
