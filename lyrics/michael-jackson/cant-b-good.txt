Open my eyes first thing I see
Your lovely smile smiling at me
Kiss my forehead up out of bed
Off to start your day here in bed I stay
Thinking bout last night be playing in my mind
When you touch me there
Ooh ooh it feels so right
Then interscinds
What am I doin
Get up out of bed
To myself thinkin


This can't be good,
This can't be good,
This can't be good
This can't be good,
This can't be good,
This can't be good

What's goin on what's happening to me
Promised myself I would never let this be
Never again, never that way
Cut me so deep that I havent' been the same
What I feel right now, I felt before
When I hear your name
And my fellins are floored
I'll fight it if I can
But I don't know if I should
The one thing I know
This can't be good babe

Oh I thing I'm falling in love again
Told myself I never would
Ii think I'm falling in love again
This can not be good
