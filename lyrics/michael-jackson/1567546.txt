Half A Chance
Gill Vince


Give me half a chance to make you love me
Give me half a chance to make you stay
Give me half a chance before you leave me
Half a chance before you turn and walk away

I'm holdin' on just like you told me
I put my heart right on the line
You know your love it really sold me
But I never had the chance to make you mine

Give me half a chance to make you love me
Give me half a chance to make you stay
Give me half a chance before you leave me
Half a chance before you turn and walk away

You said you'd never say it's over
Well I guess my heart can't beat your pride
You said I'd always be your lover
But you're gone and my tears still haven't dried

Give me half a chance to make you love me
Give me half a chance to make you stay
Give me half a chance before you leave me
Half a chance before you turn and walk away

Half a chance before you turn and walk away
