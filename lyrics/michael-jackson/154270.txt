(Start)
The first day I saw your face
My heart begin to race
My feelins being to rise
As I look into those eyes
What is this I'm feeling
As you look so appealing


We are worlds together
All for the better
I feel your love
Like doves in a world together

You are my girl
With teeth like pearls
So why don't you come with me
And feel world's peace

So take my hand
In to peace and new lands
In a world of love
Like two flying doves
So let it be you and me
For forever and ever and pass eternaty

So take my hand
In to peace and new lands
In a world of love
Like two flying doves
So let it be you and me
For forever and ever and pass eternity
