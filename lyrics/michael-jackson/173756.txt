You and me
We've traded hearts
I guess that's how
It always starts out
And then I guess it always ends


Look at us
(Now)
Sayin'
I don't think that you and me
Can just be friends
Maybe this is how the whole thing
Has to just end

And if we could
Have loved enough
(La la dee, la la dee dah dah, la la dah, la la dah, la la dah,
la...)
We would have handled
When it got rough
But one of us let go too soon

So here we are
(Here we are)
Now sayin'
I don't think that you and me
Can just be friends
Maybe this is how the whole thing
Has to just end

I wish you'd understand...

It's funny how
When love has gone
There's only one left holdin' on
When someone's always hurtin' more
Still lonely for the other

Sayin'
I don't think that you and me
Can just be friends
(Hmm...)
I don't ever wanna feel so much again
Feel again...
Unless it's you..
You... again

(La la dee, la la dee dah dah, la la dah, la la dah, la la dah,
la...)
I guess that's how it always starts out
And then I guess
It always ends

Look at us
(Look at us)
(Now)
Now sayin'
I don't think that you and me
Can just be friends
(Hmm...)
Maybe this is how the whole thing
Has to just end?

La la dee, la la dee dah dah, la la dah, la la dah, la la dah,
la...
