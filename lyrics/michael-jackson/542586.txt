Live and sin
Ten years ago on this day
My heart was yearning
I promised I would never ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart
And left me yearning


As we walked into the room
There were faces
Staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me

We walked up the stairs
Still concealing gloom
There were two girls sitting in my room
She walked up to my face
And said this is the place,
You said meet you right here at noon

This is Heartbreak hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak hotel
So this is Heartbreak hotel
This place is Heartbreak hotel

Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I am undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other

Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's a trial thought in beguile
To hurt me (this is scaring me)
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me

We came to this place, where the vicious dwell
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through

This is Heartbreak hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak hotel
So evil Heartbreak hotel
This place is Heartbreak hotel

Someone stop my heart!
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Hee!
Ten years ago today!
This is Heartbreak Hotel

Who!

Ooh!

Someone stop my heart!
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Hee!
Ten years ago today!
They took my mind!
Oo!
You broke my baby's heart!
This is Heartbreak Hotel
You spoken through to me!
Who!

Nooo-aaa!
