Nation to nation
All the world must come together
Face the problems that we see
Then maybe somehow
We can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor
She said later
What has come of all the people
Have we lost love of what it's about


I have to find my peace cuz
No one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom
What are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems
Times and tears for fears
We must live each day
Like it's the last

Go with it, go with it
Jam
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to

Jam
It ain't, It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to

The world keeps changing
Rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom
The baby boom has come of age
We'll work it out

I told my brothers
Don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system
Don't you talk to me
Don't scream and shout

She pray to God, to Buddha
Then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self
Do we know right from wrong
I just want you to
Recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me
I found peace within myself

Go with it, go with it
Jam
It ain't, It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to

Jam
It ain't, It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to

Jam
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to

Jam
It ain't, It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to

Jam, jam
Here comes the man, hot damn
The big boy stands, movin' up a hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man
Michael Jackson, Smooth Criminal
That's the man, Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door
3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan
First i cooled like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy
Now with michael
Cause it ain't hard to

Jam
It ain't, It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to

Jam
Get on it
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't stop
It ain't too much for me to

Jam
It ain't, It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to

Jam
It ain't, It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to

It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam

It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam

Get on it
Jam
It ain't, It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to

Jam
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to

Jam
Too much
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to

Get on it, get on it
Give it baby
Give it to me
Come on
You really give it too me
Got to give it
You just want to give it
