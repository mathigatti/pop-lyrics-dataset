Twenty-five miles from home, girl
My feet are hurtin' mighty bad
Now I've been walkin' for three days
And two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty bad
But I got a girl waitin' for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see, she's got the kind
Of lovin' and kissin'
Make a boy go stone wild


I got to keep on walkin'
Oh I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby callin' my name
It's as if, as though
I'm standin' at her front door
And I can hear that doggone thing
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
And when I kiss her lips
I turn backward flip
And I forget about these feet of mine

I got to keep on walkin'
Oh I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

Yeah I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
Hope my feet don't fail me now
I got five more miles to go
I got nine, eight, seven
Six, oh six

I got five more miles to go now
Over the hills just around the bend
Although my feet are tired
I can't lose my stride
I got to get my baby back again

I got to keep on walkin'
I got to walk on
Let me tell y'all
I'm so tired now
But I just can't lose my stride
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you now
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
I got to walk on
