Girl don´t you say
Girl don´t you make
Girl don´t you make
Make me cry
Make me cry


You had my life
In the palm of your hand
Why you threw it away
I´ll never ever understand
You took away the best part
The best part of me
You took away, you
How cruel could you be
You´re just another heartache
I´ve got to learn to take
You´re just another habbit
I have to learn to break
Am I alone again
Am I alone again
Am I alone, alone, alone

don´t say goodbye again
don´t say goodbye again
don´t make me cry, cry, cry
don´t say goodbye again
don´t say goodbye again
don´t make me cry, cry, cry, again
Again, again

The more I try the more you hurt me
Why
Tell me why
Tell me why

I can take an aspirin
For a bad headache
But what pill for loneliness can I take
I can seal to you
Just like cellophane
But I need you, baby
Like a star needs fame
You´re not another habbit
I have to learn to break
Let´s try to patch it up
Before it´s too late
I am in love with you
I am in love with you
I am in love, in love, in love

don´t say goodbye again
don´t say goodbye again
don´t make me cry, cry, cry
don´t say goodbye again
don´t say goodbye again
don´t make me cry, cry, cry, again

The more I try the more you hurt me
Why
Tell me why
Tell me why
