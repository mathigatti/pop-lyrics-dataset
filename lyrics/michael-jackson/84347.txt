I just want to lay next to you
For awhile
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people
Misunderstand me
That's because they don't
Know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you
God I need you
I love you so much


[Michael]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say
I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

[Siedah]
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call
I hear harps,
And angels sing

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life
Without you

[Michael]
I just can't hold on

[Siedah]
I feel we belong

[Michael]
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what
Will I do

[Siedah]
'Cause I just can't stop
Loving you

[Michael]
At night when the
Stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true

[Siedah]
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

[Michael]
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying
I do

[Siedah]
I do
This thing can't go wrong

[Michael]
This feeling's so strong

[Siedah]
Well, my life ain't
Worth living

[Both]
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what
Will I do

[Michael]
I just can't stop loving you

[Siedah]
We can change all the world
Tomorrow

[Michael]
We can sing songs of
Yesterday

[Siedah]
I can say, hey, arewell
To sorrow

[Michael]
This is my life and I

[Both]
Want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you

[Siedah]
No, baby

[Michael]
Oh!

[Both]
I just can't stop loving you

[Siedah]
If I can't stop

[Both]
And if I stop

[Siedah]
No

[Michael]
Oh! Oh! Oh, oh

[Siedah]
What will I do? Uh, ooh
(Then tell me, just what
Will I do)

[Both]
I just can't stop loving you

[Michael]
Hee! Hee! Hee! know I do
Girl

[Both]
I just can't stop loving you

[Michael]
You know I do
And if I stop

[Both]
Then tell me, just what
Will I do

[Both]
I just can't stop loving you
