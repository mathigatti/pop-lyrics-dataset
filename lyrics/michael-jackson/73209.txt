Aoww!
(Come on, babe)


They wanna get my ass
Dead or alive
You know he really tried
To take me down by surprise
I bet he missioned with the CIA
He don't do half what he say

Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Tom Sneddon is a cold man, now
Tom Sneddon is a cold man

He out shock in every single way
He'll stop at nothing just to get his political say
He think he hot 'cause he's the S.D.A.
I bet he never had a social life anyway
You think he brother with the KKK
I bet his mother never taught him right anyway
He want your vote just to remain D.A.
He don't do half what he say

'Cause Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Go on, boy
Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Go on, boy
Tom Sneddon is a cold man, now
Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Thomas Sneddon is a cold man

Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Tom Sneddon is a cold man, now
Tom Sneddon is a cold man
He just, he just, go on, boy!

Slash!

Aoww!
(Come on, babe)

Does he send letters to the FBI
Does he say to either do it or die

Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Go on, boy!
Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Go on, boy!
Tom Sneddon is a cold man, now
Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Thomas Sneddon is a cold man

Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Tom Sneddon is a cold man, now
Tom Sneddon is a cold man
He just, he just
Thomas Sneddon is a cold man

Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Tom Sneddon is a cold man, now
Tom Sneddon is a cold man
He just, he just, doggone
Thomas Sneddon is a cold man

Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Tom Sneddon is a cold man, now
Tom Sneddon is a cold man
He just, he just, he just
Cold man
