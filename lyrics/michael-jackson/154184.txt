Everybody look around-
'Cause there's a reason to rejoice
You see-
Everybody come out,
And let's commence to singing joyfully...


Everybody look up-
And feel the hope
That we've been waiting on-
Everybody's glad
Because our silent fear
And dread is gone...

Freedom you see,
Has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself
To check it out

Can't you feel a brand-new day?
Can't you feel a brand-new day?
Can't you feel a brand-new day?
Can't you feel a brand-new day?

Everybody be glad
Because the sun is shining just for us
Everybody wake up!
Into the morning, into happiness

Hello world!
It's like a different way of living now...
And thank you world
We'd always knew that we'd be free somehow

In harmony,
Let's show the world that we've got liberty
It's such a change
For us to live so independently-

Freedom, you see-
Has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about,
You owe it to yourself to check it out

Can't you feel a brand-new day?
Can't you feel a brand-new day?
Can't you feel a brand-new day?

Everybody be glad
Because the sun is shining just for us
Everybody wake up!
Into the morning, into happiness

Hello world!
It's like a different way of living now...
And thank you world
We'd always knew that we'd be free somehow

In harmony,
Let's show the world that we've got liberty
It's such a change
For us to live so independently-

Freedom, you see-
Has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about,
You owe it to yourself to check it out

Can't you feel a brand-new day?
Can't you feel a brand-new day?
Can't you feel a brand-new day?

Can't you feel a - brand new day?...
