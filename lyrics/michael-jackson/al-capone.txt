Why did you let him get away?
After the scary, what you say?
Shooting me bullets, cold as ice
Standing my face then pulled the knife


She’s heard just fired down, he’s in
No one had job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get her?

Too bad, forget it
‘Cause there’s Al Capone who’s in it
So sad, regret it
Cause the madman’s out tonight

Should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
I don’t wanna sleepin’
Nobody should be grieving this way

Should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
I don’t wanna sleepin’
Nobody should be grieving this way

Why did you let him get away?
After the scary, what you say?
Shooting me bullets, cold as ice
Standing my face then put it back

She’s heard just fired down, he’s in
No one had job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get her?

Too bad, forget it
‘Cause there’s Al Capone who’s in it
So sad, regret it
And I told her out tonight

Should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
I don’t wanna sleepin’
Nobody should be grieving this way

Should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
I don’t wanna sleepin’
Nobody should be grieving this way

Too bad, forget it
‘Cause there’s Al Capone, who’s in it
So sad, regret it
‘Cause the man is out tonight

Should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
I don’t wanna sleepin’
Nobody should be grieving this way

Should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
I don’t wanna sleepin’
Nobody should be grieving this way

Why did you let him get away?
After the scary, what you say?
Shooting me bullets, cold as ice
Standing my face then put it back

She’s heard just fired down, he’s in
No one had job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
How could you let him get away?
