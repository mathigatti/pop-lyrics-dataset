[INTRO]
Too Late 
Too Late 
Too Late 


[VERSE 1]
In this automatic age 
We shop through the yellow page 
Gone is the corner store 
There is a supermarket there for you 

People give way to change
But feelings remain the same 

[CHORUS] 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
Well it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 

[VERSE 2]
It's a new day, a new age 
A photograph just taken, is ready one minute later 
Cars are bigger and better 
But the manufacturer's sastified never 
In a world full of crime 
I can't let you think that's right 

[CHORUS] 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 
No, no 

[BRIDGE 1]
So you wanna be a star (so you wanna be a star)
You are who you think you are (ah think you are)
You don't have to go further 
Than my loving arms 

[CHORUS half]
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 

[BRIDGE 2]
Are you sure you wanna go to New York City (New York City) 
Where girls make it big if they're pretty (If they pretty) 
Let say you get that penthouse view 
But who's gonna love you the way I do (just the way i do) 

[CHORUS] 
It's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time, no
Too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

[CHORUS] 
it's too late, too late to change the time 
It's too late, too late to change the time 
Ooh, too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
