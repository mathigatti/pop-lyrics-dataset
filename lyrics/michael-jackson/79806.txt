Love ain't what it used to be
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in stick it out
That ain't what it's all about


He want to do something keen to you
He want to wrap his arms
All around you girl
He want to shake it up
Shake it down
Doing it right
He want to jump back
Half flap, doing it right

He want to lay you down
Turn it up, kicking it loose
He want to fly high nigh high
Baby for you'se

He want to motormouth
Float around, baby the back
He want to shake it up
Shake it down
Moving round ha ha

Love ain't what it used to be
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in stick it out
That ain't what it's all about

Susie like to agitate
Get the boy and make him wait
Mother's preaching Abraham
Brothers they don't give a damn

He want to do something keen to you
He want to wrap his arms
All around you girl
He want to do it up keep it high
Deep in the night
He want to eye ball
Get hard
Playing it right

He want to turn the key
Hurt the sheets
Move to the left
He want to hot scrub
Hot love
Making it wet

He want to give hot jump shot
Move to the left
He want to time bar
Slam dunk ha ha ha

Hoo! Hee!
Keep it goin'
Party now
Hee! Hee!

Love ain't what it used to be
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about

Sister say she love him some
(She's doin' it, she's doin' it)
God is jammin' on the run
Mother's preaching Abraham
Brothers they don't give a damn

Johnny's begging pretty please
(Keep the brother on his knees)
Keep the brother on his knees
(Hee hee!)
Susie likes to agitate
(Keep doin' it keep doin' it)
Get the boy and make him wait

Sister's marries to a hood
Sayin' that she got it good
Holy Mary, mercy me
I can't believe the things I see

Thinkin' that they got it made
They doin' what they used to hate
Push it in, stick it out
(Keep doin' it) (Keep doin' it)
That ain't what it's all about
That ain't what it's all about

Holy Mary, mercy me
(She's holy Mary moly Mary)
I can't believe the things I see
(Goin' on now) (Hee Hee!)
Mother's preaching Abraham
(She's doin' it she's doin' it)
Brothers they don't give a damn

(Holy Mary moly Mary)
Sister say she loves him some
(She's goin' down)
God is jammin' all around
(God is jammin')
Holy Mary, mercy me
(She's holy Mary moly Mary)
I can't believe the things I see

You're doin' it
You're dirty, keep doin' it
You're dirty, keep nasty
You're nasty, you're doin' it
You're dirty, you're dirty
You're doin' it, you're nasty
You're doin' it
Keep dirty, keep dirty
You really want it

(Go'on now)

Holy Mary, mercy me
I can't believe the things I see
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about
