Xscape


Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The systems in control, it's all run by the book
I've got to get away so I can free my mind
Xscape is what I need
Away from electric eyes

No matter where I am, I see my face around
They pin lies on my name, they push them from town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to find a place
But I won't hide away

Xscape
Got to get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
The man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta please nobody but me

I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games
It's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to?
When is my personal life and I don't live for you
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
You be concerned about you,
I can do what I want to

Xscape
Got to get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
The man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta please nobody but me

Xscape
Got to get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
The man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta please nobody but me

Xscape, Where did I go
This problem world won't bother me
This problem world won't bother me
yeah, oh, yeah, ohh

Xscape
Got to get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
The man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta please nobody but me

Xscape
Got to get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
The man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta please nobody but me

Xscape
Got to get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
The man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta please nobody but me
