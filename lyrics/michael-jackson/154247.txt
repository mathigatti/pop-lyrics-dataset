Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby


I thought the grass was green on the other side
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye
There's a card in my hand
Tears fall like rain
I wanna come home again
I want you to... 

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ain't no love in thsis world
Ain't no love in this world without you

In my search to find myself
I saw your face and nothing else
Every place I go everything I do
I still feel the need for you
Come on and... 

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby

I'm on my way back to you
And I wanna make it up to you
And all the prolems that I caused you
If ti takes my life I'll make it up to you
I just want you to take me, take me
Take me, take me, take me, take me

Take me back, forgive me
Take me back where I belong
If you can, if you can find it
In your heart to forgive me
