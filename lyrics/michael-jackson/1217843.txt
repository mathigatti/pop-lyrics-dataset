Konvict, Konvict
I met her on the walk way
Staring as she walked pass
She looked back at me side ways and said
I can't help but to ask
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' something


We end up going back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
We hit it off until the morning
Until you hear her say
Ama ma se
Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa
Ma ma coo sa

Billie jean is always talkin'
When nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin' to start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'

It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin' to start my baby crying
Talkin', squealin', lyin you got my baby crying

It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

Ama ma se
Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa
Ma ma coo sa
What did I make her say

It's getting little crazy (is getting crazy)
Always messing with my baby (messing with my baby)
And that's the reason she crys
When I am not by her side
At the lonliest night (without my baby)
But I love you
Always pompin when I'm thinking about you
I wanna be back tonight and share that look on your face
When you say

Ama ma se
Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa
Ma ma coo sa
I want to make her say

It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
