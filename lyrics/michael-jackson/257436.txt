I guess I'll always a dreamer
Dreaming my life away, dreaming my life away
A romantic fool, that's what I am
I think about you, all day long
Though it's impossible, for us together
Oh it's not real, a love I can't feel


Guess I'll always be a dreamer
Dreaming my life away, dreaming my life away
I just can't wait, till I go to sleep
I'll be with you, all night long
Circumstances held me in a terrible face
It's fantasy, I just like to share these moments together

Guess I'll always be a dreamer
Dreaming my life away, dreaming my life away
And nothing comes but sleep, to a dreamer
And when you wake up the dream is gone away

Guess I'll always be a dreamer
Dreaming my life away, dreaming my life away
Guess I'll always be a dreamer
