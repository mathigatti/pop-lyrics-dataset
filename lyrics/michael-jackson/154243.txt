Never try to talk about it
It's got to sound good to me inside
I just think about it


I'm so undemanding
'Cause they say love is blind
I've lived this life pretending
I can bear this hurt deep inside

The truth is that I'm longing
For love that's so divine
I've searched this whole world wishing
She'll be there time after time

So someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

I've lived my life the lonely
A soul that cries of shame
With handicapped emotions
Save me now from what still remains

I'll be your story hero
A serenading ryne
I'm just needing that someone
Save me now from the path I'm on...

Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

When you say we will dance 'til the light of day
It's just like the children in earth's joy
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay
It's because I'm needing that someone

Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Love
