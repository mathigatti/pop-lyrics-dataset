Hee! Hee!
Ooh!
Go on girl!
Aaow!


Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk
Your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car
And we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

I like the feeling you're giving me
Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh I'll be working from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now baby-hee!
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
A-acha-acha (my lonely days are gone)
Acha-ooh!

Go on girl!
Go on! Hee! Hee! Aaow!
Go on girl!

I never felt so in love before
I promise baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now baby-hee!
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
(The way you make me fell)
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
(You really turn me on) hee hee!
(You knock me off of my feet) hee hee! Ooh!
(My lonely days are gone)

Give it to me, give me some time
(The way you make me feel)
Come on be my girl, I wanna blow your mind
(You really turn me on)
Ain't nobody's business
(You knock me off of my feet)
Ain't nobody's business, but mine and my baby
Go on girl! Aaow!
(My lonely days are gone)

Hee hee! Aaow!
Chika, chika
Chika, chika, chika
Go on girl! - hee hee!
(The way you make me feel)
Hee hee hee!
(You really turn me on)
(You knock me off of my feet)
(My lonely days are gone)

Give it to me, give me some time
