Everybody wanting a piece of Michael Jackson
Reporter's talking the moves of Michael Jackson
Just when you thought he was done
He comes to give it again
They could put it around the world today
He wanna write my obituary


No matter what, you just wanna read it again
No matter what, you just wanna feel it again

Why is it strange that I would fall in love
Who is the boogie man you thinkin' of
How am I crazy cause I just don't know
This is breaking news (2x)

Everybody watching the news of Michael Jackson
They want to see that I fall,
Cause I'm Michael Jackson
You write the words to destroy
Like it's a weapon
You turned your back on a love
And you can't get it again

No matter what, you just wanna read it again
No matter what, you just wanna feel it again

Why is it strange that I would fall in love
Who is the boogie man you thinkin' of
How am I crazy cause I just don't know
This is breaking news (2x)

All the news today they say we "crazy celebrity'
I know it's crazy day, we want this play, baby

Why is it strange that I would fall in love
Who is the boogie man you thinkin' of
How am I crazy cause I just don't know
This is breaking news (2x)

You're breaking news
