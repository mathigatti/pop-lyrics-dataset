Never have I ever been so sure
(Oh, no, now)
Never thought I'd see you walk in that door
(Oh, now, yeah)
I can make you feel (like you're a queen)
No remedies (no compromise)
Would you rather be, right here with me
I want you right here next to me


Do you really wanna stay?
(We can take it slow)
Do you wanna walk away
(If you let it go)
Girl I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind
Do you really wanna stay?
(We can take it slow)
Do you really wanna go?
(If you let it go)
So I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind

She never thought she'd be here waiting on me
(Oh, no, now)
I'd never thought I'd be here back in my ways
When you're in need
Your fantasy (all here with me)
Would you rather be, right here with me
Girl, get into me

Anything, oh anything
To chase the rain goodbye
When you left with all your dreams
I couldn't say goodnight
She was contagious, she was contagious
She was my baby
Te quiero, I love you
Say goodbye, say goodbye

Don't go away
Stay by my side
Stay by my side
