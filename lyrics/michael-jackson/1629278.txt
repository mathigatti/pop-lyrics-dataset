For the moon and the stars
Prays in all day full,
What is and what was
Take hold of your iman
Don't givin to shaitan
Oh you who believe please give thanks to Allah.
Allahu Ghefor Allahu Rahim Allahu yuhibo el Mohsinin,
Hua Khalikhone hua Razikhone whahoa ala kolli sheiin khadir


Allah is Ghefor Allah is Rahim Allah is the one who loves the Mohsinin,
He is a Creater, He is a Sistainer and He is the One Who has Power over all.
