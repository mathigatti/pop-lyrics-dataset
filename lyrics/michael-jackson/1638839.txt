You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance {You can't really stand it, baby}
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance {Ooh}


You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance {You can't really stand it, baby}
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance {Ooh}

Standin' at the edge of time
'Bout to lose my mind
'Cause you try to take him away from me
But I won't let it be

You just walk into my life
And try to take away my only prize
But you better get ready
'Cause his love is right here with me

You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance

He belongs to me
Just wait and see
I'll take him in my arms
He's in love, in love too much with me

Nothin' you can do or say
Could make him look your way
So you better get ready
'Cause he's gonna come walkin' my way

You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance {You can't really stand it, baby}
You don't stand another chance (You don't stand, baby)
You don't stand another chance {Ooh}

You don't stand another chance (Stand)
You don't stand another chance (You don't stand, baby)
You don't stand another chance (You don't stand)
You don't stand another chance (Another chance)

Sit and wait at home
But leave me alone
You'll be with him when he's up, not down
Until the mornin' ground

Let me tell you somethin', it's true
He's not in love with you
So you better get ready
'Cause there's nothin' comin' down your way

You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance {You don't stand it}
You don't stand another chance (You don't stand)
You don't stand another chance (Another chance)

You don't stand another chance (Another chance)
You don't stand another chance (You don't stand, baby)
You don't stand another chance {Ooh} (Baby)
You don't stand another chance

Hey
Hey
You don't stand
Hey
Hey
You don't stand

Hey
Hey
You don't stand
Hey
Hey
You don't stand

You don't stand {Ooh} (You don't stand)

Well, you know
Somebody's gotta lose
We all can't win (Another chance)
Maybe next time {Ooh}

You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance {You can't really stand it, baby} (You don't stand, baby)
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance (Another chance)

You don't {Ooh}
You don't stand it
Another chance

You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance {Yeah}
You don't stand another chance {You can't stand}
You don't stand another chance

You don't stand (Ow, baby) {Ooh}
