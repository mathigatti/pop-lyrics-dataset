I was a fool
Too blind to see
I turned my back
On all your needs
What a price
I almost let you get away


You're like the precious air I breathe
Without your love
I'm not complete
Now, I know
And my forever starts today

'Cause it's alright now with me
Yes, it's alright now, you see
I'll be all you'll ever need
This time

I can believe in who I am
Now that you're back with me again
I can see
That what is meant will always be

Let me reach out
And take your hand
I'll make you know
I am your man
You're the one that I will love eternally

'Cause it's alright now with me
Yes, it's alright now, you see
I'll be all you'll ever need
This time
'Cause it's alright now with me
Yes, it's alright now, you see
I'll be all you'll ever need
This time

This is the time
When we give to each other
Whatever we need
We learn that by giving
We'll always receive
And I know that our love
Will be all it can be
Ooh, this time
