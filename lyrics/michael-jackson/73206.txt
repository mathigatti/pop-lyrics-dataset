Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting
So what does it mean, damnit!
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damnit!


Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're selling out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

With such confusions
Don't it make you wanna scream
(Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusing
Victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody, please, have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me
Just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me
Just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me
Make me wanna scream

Tired of your telling
(Telling)
The story your way
(The story your way)
You're causing confusion
(Confusion)
Then think it's okay, damnit

Keep changing the rules
While you're playing the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane

(Now, baby)
With such confusion
Don't it make you wanna scream
(Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusing
Victimize within the scheme
(Scream it baby)
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie
Oh father, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me
Just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me
Just stop pressuring me
Stop fucking with me
Make me wanna scream

Oh, my God, can't believe what I saw
As I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice
All the injustice

A man has been brutally beaten to death by Police
After being wrongly identified as a robbery suspect
The man was an 18 year old black male

Yeah yeah
Baby

With such collusions
Don't it make you wanna scream
(Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusing
(Make you wanna scream)
Victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it
Just can't take it

Stop pressuring me
Just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me
Just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me
Make me wanna scream

Stop pressuring me
Just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me
Just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me
Make me wanna scream

Stop your pressure!
