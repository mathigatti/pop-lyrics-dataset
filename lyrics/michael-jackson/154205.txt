Miss Lady Girl
Is putting her love on the shelf
Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else


She's taken her heart
And put it away under lock and key
But its high time
Miss Lady Girl sets her heart free and gives her love to me

Some think that diamond rings; fancy cars
Will make a big impression
But I know that all she needs is my tender
Love and affection
Cause she still says

That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will

No one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I know that I will be the one who will

Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it, get it

Miss Lady Girl
Has buried her feelings deep inside
Cause she don't want
To be taken for another ride

She's sick and tired
Of being on that lonely merry-go-round
She just don't know
That the ultimate love of her life is about to be found

They think that ready cash, flashy clothes
Will her life with laughter
But I've got the very thing that she needs
True love forever after
Then no more will she say

That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will

No one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I know that I will be the one who will

Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it, get it
