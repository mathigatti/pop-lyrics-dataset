Aaow!
Tcha!
Chika chika!


As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet

She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay?
Would you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign at the window
Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie

He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down, it was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A smooth criminal

Aaow!

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
(Annie, are you okay?) Annie, are you okay?
(So, Annie, are you okay?) Annie, are you okay?
(Are you okay, Annie?)
(Annie, are you okay?) Annie, are you okay?
(So, Annie, are you okay) Annie, are you okay?
(Are you okay, Annie?)
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay?
Would you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign at the window
That he struck you a crescendo, Annie

He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down, it was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been struck by
A smooth criminal

Chika, chika, Aaow!

(Okay, I want everybody
To clear the area right now!)

Aaow!
Aaow!
Aaow!
Haow!

Aaow!
Annie are you okay? (I don't know)
Would you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sign at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie (I don't know)

He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie (Dang gone it)

Annie are you okay? (Dang gone it, baby!)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dang gone it, baby!)
There's a sound at the window (Dang gone it, baby!)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie
Hoo! Hoo!

He came into your apartment (Dang gone it!)
Left bloodstains on the carpet
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down (Dang gone it!)
It was your doom Annie

Aaow!
Aaow!
Aaow!
Aaow!

Chika, chika
Chika, chika, Aaow!
