No mercy
This is officially a Refugee Camp Remix
Home with it


I'm right back where I wanna be
Told me that you're doin' wrong, (oh my, zippin' through)
Word out shockin' all alone (no)
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwin' rocks to hide your hand (yeah, hey)

You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done enough for me
You are disgustin' me
(Yeah, yeah)
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad

Ah, look who just walked in the place (refugee camp)
Dead and stuffy in the face (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Look who's standing if you please (yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, though you tried to bring me to my knees

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

You say jump forte
Like the major holiday
I met with MJ on the ranch of seven fey
Flowin' to them g six, that's how you saw them remix
Blast off a cramp while I laugh at yo re-six
T double O B A to the D
You just double A
Small town battery
Buffet
You can't eat of them floor we bend
Word like the power lunch of the four seasons
Too bad

What do you want from me
What do you want from me

Tired of you haunting me
(Yeah, yeah)
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad

Look who got slapped in the face (refugee camp)
It's dead and stuffy in the pplace (get the cash)
Right back where I wanna be
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

It's just too much for me
You just too much for me
You just too much for me
You just too much for me
Too bad, too bad about it
You just too much for me
You just too much for me
You just
Just too
Now get the feelin'

Beat it

I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm right back where I wanna be
