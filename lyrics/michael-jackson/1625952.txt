Last night, an angel came to me
I was cryin' alone
My heart was bleeding
Last night, an angel came to me
I was cryin' alone
My mind was dying
God have mercy


Stop them destroying me
An angel came to me
To save my life
Listen to his voice
Please hear his soul
This angel came to me
To save me
Last night, an angel came to me
I was doing wrong
I was doing wrong
Last night, an angel came to me
I was sleepin' wrong
I was sleepin' wrong

God have mercy
Stop them destroying me
An angel came to me
To forgive me
Listen to his prayers
Please feel his love
This angel came to me
God saved me
An angel came to me
To fulfill his prophecy
He listened to my prayers
Please feel my love
This angel came to me
I recognised him
I recognised him

Ad libs:
An angel, baby, did you hear it
(An angel)
I tell you baby, did you hear it
(An an-gel)
I tell you baby, did you hear it
(An angel)
I tell you honey, did you hear it
(An an-gel)
An angel came to me
An an-gel.
