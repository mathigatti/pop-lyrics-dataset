No sense pretending is over
Hard times just don't go away
You gotta take that chip off your shoulder
It's time you open up, have some faith


Nothing good ever comes easy
All good things come in due time, yes it does
You gotta have something to believe in
I'm telling you to open your mind

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line

You see yourself in the mirror
And you don't like what you see
And things aren't getting much clearer
Don't you think it's time you go for a change

Don't waste your time on the past, no no
It's time you look to the future
It's all right there if you ask
This time if you try much harder
You'll be the best that you can be

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line

If you wanna make it right
And you wanna do it now
You gotta learn to try
You can make it right somehow

Let love come free
And that's just so easy now
You gotta go for what you want
You gotta know what you got to do

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line
