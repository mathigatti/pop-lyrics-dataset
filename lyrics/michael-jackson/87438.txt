Here come ol' flat top
She come groovin' up slowly
She's got Joo Joo eyeball
She one holy roller
She got hair down to her knees
Got to be a joker he just do what he please


She wear no shoe shine
She's got toe jam football
She's got monkey finger
She shoot Coca-Cola
She say: I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Come together
Right now
Over me

She bag production
She's got walrus gum-boot
She's got Ono sideboard
She one spinal cracker
She got feet down through his knees
Hold you in his armchair
You can feel his disease

Come together
Right now
Over me
Come together babe
Come together babe
Come together
Come together

She roller coaster
She's got early warning
She's got muddy water
She one Mojo filter
She say: One and one and one is three
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see

Come together
Right now
Over me
