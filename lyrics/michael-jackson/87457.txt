Stone shaker is looking fine
She's a heart-breaker every time
She never seems to realize
That someday she'll be crying too, ooh!


(She is) a sharp shooter that's moving fast
A slight cruiser loaded with gas
Slowing down to make a pass
You think it's gonna hit you
So why not take a chance?

'Cause this is Hot Street (burnin' It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street, ooh!

A street walker when there's time to spare
Big spenders holding their share
A heart of gold, but no one cares
(No one seems to care)
Within their eyes

Some young lovers are laughing loud
And there's some old suckers trying to get down
The evening spins around and round
(Spins around and round)
Yes, people of the night smoking through the dark

'Cause this is Hot Street (burnin' It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street, ooh!

(All night mover) Just trying to put a little fun in their lives
(Winners, losers)
You see them standing on the corner in the neon light, ow!
(Tonight) ooh! Yeah, yeah, ooh!

Some feeling you can't explain
It's such a hard feeling lying in bed's flame
The evening starts to fall again (starts to fall again)
It's time to come alive
So why not take a chance?

'Cause this is Hot Street (burnin' It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street, ooh!
'Cause this is Hot Street (burnin' It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street, ooh!

(Burnin' it up)
(Fun on the run)
(Ready or not)
(The fantasy will never stop)
