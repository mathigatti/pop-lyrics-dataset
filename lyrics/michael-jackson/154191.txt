[VERSE 1]
Cinderella, stay awhile
You're the one
That I've been lookin' for
Cinderella, when you smile
All around me sunbeams
Start to fall


Midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Now that you are here
Stay awhile

[VERSE 2]
Cinderella, I just know
That the magic slipper's
Gonna to fit
Cinderella, do not go
You're my princess
I am sure of it

This is love for sure
Love that's sweet and pure
Love that will endure
Stay awhile

[BRIDGE]
When you speak the angels all sing
This is the kind of magic you bring, oh

[VERSE 3]
Cinderella, stay awhile
This is like a fairytale with you
Cinderella, when you smile
All my fairytales are coming true

Well my only fear
Is midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Stay awhile, oh

(Fairytales, make-believe and you)
(Fairytales, make-believe and you) 

Cinderella, stay awhile
Don't you go
Oh
