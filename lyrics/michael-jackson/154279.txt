When you're down and trubled 
And you need some love and care 
And nothin', no nothin' is goin' right 
Just close your eyes and think of me 
And soon I'll be there to brighten up 
Yeah, even your darkest night 
You just call out my name 
And you know, wherever I am 
I'll come a-runnin' 
To see you again 
Chorus : 
Winter, spring, summer or fall 
All you have to do is call 
And I'll be there, yeah I will 
You've got a freind 


When the sky above you 
Grows dark and full of clouds 
And that old north wind 
He begins to blow 
Here's what you do baby 
Keep your head together 
And call my name out loud 
And soon you'll hear me 
Knockin' at your door 
Oh yes I will, yes I will 
You just call out my name 
And you know, wherever I am 
I'll come a-runnin' 
To see you again 

Chorus 

Ain't it good to know 
That you've got a freind 
People can be so cold 
They'll hurt you and desert you 
And take your soul if you let them 
Oh, don't let them 

Chorus : 
Winter, spring, summer or fall 
All you have to do is call 
And I'll be there, yes I will 

You've got a freind, yes you do 
You've got a freind, yes you do 
Right till the end, for you 
Ain't it good to know
