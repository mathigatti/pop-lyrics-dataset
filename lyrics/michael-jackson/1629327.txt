Gonna tell you right
Gonna show your stuff
Don't ever stop
'Til you get enough
The feelin's good
Comin' off the day
You're reachin' up
The choice is made
(Well) they say the sky's the limit
There's nothin' stoppin' you
You're a brand new generation
And Pepsi's comin' through
You know I'm Bad
I'm bad, come on
And Pepsi's cool
It's cool, you know it
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it, you know
And the whole world has to answer right now
To tell you the Pepsi way
It's cool
