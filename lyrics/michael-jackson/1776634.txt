My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love...
(Huhhh-Ooh)


(Chorus)
I walked away but I was wrong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the one that keeps me strong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm
(I can't make it another day)
How did I get through this storm?
(I can't make it another day without your love...)

(Hoohoo)
(Come on now!)

At night, I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you
(finding you)
I've opened up my heart to let you to come through
I'll be forever searching for your love...
(Huhhh-ooooh)

(Chorus)
I walked away but I was wrong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the one that keeps me strong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm
(I can't make it another day)
How did I get through this storm?
(I can't make it another day without your love...)

(Come on now!) (Hoohoo Hoohoo)
(Come on now!) (Hoohoo)
(Huhhh-ooooh)

(Chorus)
I walked away but I was wrong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the one that keeps me strong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm
(I can't make it another day)
How did I get through this storm?
(I can't make it another day without your love...)
