I don't know
Bet you want to try
Every time you see


Do you remember
When we fell in love
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember
How it all began
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember
Back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare
(Tell me)

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember
How we used to talk
(You know)
We'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said like
I love you so I'll never let you go

Do you remember
Back in the Spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby!

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
Remeber my baby

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
Remeber my baby

Remember the times
Ooh
Remember the times
Do you remember girl
Remember the times
On the phone you and me
Remember the times
Till dawn, Two or three
What about us girl

Remember the times
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
In the park, on the beach
Remember the time
You and me in Spain
Remember the time
What about, what about
Prrrap, dap, dap, dap prrrap

Remember the times
Ooh, in the park
Remember the times
After dark, do you, do you, do you?
Remember the time
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
Yeah yeah
