[1st Verse]
There's A Steam Beat
And It's Comin' After You
You Can Take It
If You Only Let Your Feelings Through


[Refrain]
So D.J. Spin The Sounds
There Ain't No Way That Your Gonna
Let Us Down
Gonna Dance Gonna Burn This Disco Out

[Chorus]
Groove All Night
Keep The Boogie Alright
Get That Sound
Everybody Just Get On Down

[2nd Verse]
Got A Hot Foot
Better Freak Across The Floor
Join The Party
And We'll Keep You Movin', That's For Sure

[Refrain]
So D.J. Spin The Sounds
There Ain't No Way That Your Gonna
Sit Us Down
Gonna Dance 'Til We Burn This Disco Out

[Chorus]
Groove All Night
Keep The Boogie Alright
Get That Sound
Everybody Just Get On Down

[Bridge]
Once You Get The Beat Inside Your Feet
There Ain't No Way To Stop You Movin' Good
Now The Weekend's Come It's Time For Fun
You Got To Groove Just Like You Know You Should

[3rd Verse]
People Now
Are You Ready
Won't You Rock Across The Room
Got A Feelin'
That We're Gonna Raise The Roof Off Soon

[Refrain]
So D.J. Spin The Sounds
There Ain't No Way That Your Gonna
Sit Us Down
Gonna Dance 'Til We Burn This Disco Out

[Chorus]
Groove All Night
Keep The Boogie Alright
Get That Sound
Everybody Just Get On Down

[Refrain]
So D.J. Spin The Sounds
There Ain't No Way That Your Gonna
Sit Us Down
Gonna Dance 'Til We Burn This Disco Out

[Chorus]
Groove All Night
Keep The Boogie Alright
Get That Sound
Everybody Just Get On Down

[Chant:]
Gonna Dance, Gonna Shout
Gonna Burn This Disco Out
Gonna Dance, Gonna Shout
Gonna Burn This Disco Out
Gonna Dance, Gonna Shout
Gonna Burn This Disco Out
