As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped and got out
And looked down, I noticed I got a flat


So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said, "don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there"

Woah, oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

Woah, oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
A where kids are playing and people are laughin' and smilin'
And nothing to fear

She said, "this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness"
She turned around, looked down at my eyes and started crying
And grabbed my hand, "you've got a friend"

Woah, oh
Take me to a place without no name
(No name!)
Take me to a place without no name
(A place without, a place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name
(Take me, take me, place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name
(A place without)

Woah! Yeah, doggone! Woah

She started liking me, kissing me and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen, things I've never done
This really looks like a lotta fun

I've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
Why in the world could I want to leave?

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Woah!
Take me to a place without no name
(Doggone, take me, no name)
Take me to a place without no name
(A place without, no, no, no)
Na, na, na, na, na (na, na)
(Place without no name)
Na, na, na, na, na (na, na, na)
(A place without no name)
