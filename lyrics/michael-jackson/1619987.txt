I don't like it baby
When you're stopping me on the floor
'Cause the more I keep on dancin'
The more I keep wanting some more


I don't care what you're saying
You're talking in my ear much too loud
And the music's taking my body
On a trip from nine to five

Keep me dancin' all night
All night, all night
Gonna dance up fire
Calling engine number 109
There ain't no chains to hold me
Gonna burn this place down till five

You can't stop this fever
'Cause my temperature is burning hot
And all I want to do is dance, dance
Sweating from my face to my feet

Keep me dancin' all night
Keep me dancin' all night
Keep me dancin' all night
Keep me dancin' all night
