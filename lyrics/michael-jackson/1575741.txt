People all over the world
are the same everywhere I go
I give in to this, I give in to that
Every day it bothers me so


Am I in a bad situation
People taking me to the exteme
Am I being used
I just need a clue
I don't know which way to go

So I took my problems to a doctor
So he could check it out, (he don't know)
Took it to a palm reader so she could
Read my hand, (she don't know)

(Five minutes later )
I started to understand
I started screaming, shouting, acting mad
No one could help me but myself
But I gave everything I had

Chorus:
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me

Always wanting something for nothing
Especially what they don't deserve
Reaching in my pocket
I just got to stop it
Even though they got a lot of nerve

Am I in a bad situation
People taking me to the extreme
They don't use rejection
So I need protection
To keep my equity

So I took my problems to a doctor
So he could check it out, (he don't know)
Took it to a palm reader so she could
Read my hand, (she don't know)

(Five minutes later)
I started to understand
I started screaming, shouting, acting mad
No one could help me but myself
But I gave everything I had

Chorus:
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
