All right

We can walk away
But I turn my head to see if you would stay, baby
We can love the day
Then I'm hoping that we throw those stones away


Baby, yeah

Baby, don't you leave me standing here
Why you leave me standing here
Now you got me here in tears
Hold me

Hold me tonight (ah)
Spread your love tonight (yeah)
It's gonna be all right (ah)
Everything will be just fine
In love with me tonight
Tell me it's gonna be just fine
It's gonna be all right
Say it's gonna just fine
Everything's just fine (yeah)
Everything will be just fine

All right

She wrote me a letter, it's burning in my heart
She's setting me free (she's in the dark)
Whisper in the dark, save me from these thoughts
Un-break my heart
Don't you let it fall apart

Please, stay this way
Don't you run away
I got premonition (I used to dream)
Ooh, girl, it burns just like the sun

Hold me tonight  (ah)
Spread your love tonight (yeah)
It's gonna be all right (ah) (oh, oh)
Everything will be just fine
In love with me tonight
Tell me it's gonna be just fine
It's gonna be all right
Say it's gonna just fine
Everything's just fine (oh)
Everything will be

Wake me up when all this is new like morning (like morning)
Girl, your smile always makes me cry
(If you think you're gonna)
Just hold me, kiss me, touch me (oh)
(Stay with me tonight) (ah, ah)

All right, it's all right
All right, it's all right
It's all right, all right with me

It's all right, all right
It's all right, all right with me
It's all right, all right
It's all right, all

All right, it's all right
All right, it's all right
All right
