They say I'm different
They don't understand
But there's a bigger problem
That's much more in demand
You got world hunger
Not enough to eat
So there's really no time
To be trippin' on me


You got school teachers
Who don't wanna teach
You got grown people
Who can't write or read
You got strange diseases
Ah but there's no cure
You got many doctors
That aren't so sure
So tell me

Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Stop trippin'

We've got more problems
Than we'll ever need
You got gang violence
And bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people
With no food to eat
With no clothes on their back
And no shoes for their feet

We've got drug addiction
In the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption
Police brutality
We've got streetwalkers
Walkin' into darkness
Tell me
What are we doin'

To try to stop this

Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Ooh stop trippin'
Yeah stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'

Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Stop trippin'

Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Ooh stop trippin'
Yeah stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'

Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
