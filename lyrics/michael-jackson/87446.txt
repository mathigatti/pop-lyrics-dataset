My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk


I can not explain the things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you need (oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh)

It feels so right (girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life
All my life (oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh)
It feels like I (like I)
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (see)
And I finally found, come on girl

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I'm gonna give (you rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (you rocked my world)

You rocked my world, you know you did (girl)
And everything I'm gonna give (I want you, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently

Girl, you know it seems
My life is fully complete
Our love is true because of you
Keep doing what you do (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Who'd think that I
Have finally found the perfect love
I searched for all my life (searched for all my life)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Who'd think I'd find (whoa, oh, oh)
Such a perfect love that's awesomely so right (whoa, girl)
