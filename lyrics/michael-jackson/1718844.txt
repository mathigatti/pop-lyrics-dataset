Girl, close your eyes...
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothing that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love


I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
I'm gonna rock the night away

When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you this part of town
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way

So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (live it off the wall)

Lovely
Is the feeling now
Fever
Temperatures rising now
Power (oh power)
Is the force the vow
That makes it happen
It asks no questions why, ooh
Get closer (closer now)
To my body now
Just love me
Until you don't know how

Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop until you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop until you get enough

Guitar solo

Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop until you get enough
