Sun comes up on this new mornin'
Shiftin' shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything


And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With the tender touch, you know so well
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters
Baby who can really tell,
When two hearts belong so well

And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun refuse to shine
When I say, I love you
Baby you gotta know
(That's for all time)
Baby you gotta know
(That's for all time)

Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'll go anywhere
Just as long as you are there

And maybe the walls will tumble
Sun refuse to shine
When I say, I love you
Baby you gotta know
(That's for all time)
Baby you gotta know
(That's for all time)

Oh, then on these quiet days
Where souls embrace
So silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say

And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun refuse to shine
When I say, I need you
Baby you gotta know
(That's for all time)
Baby you gotta know
(That's for all time)

Say that you never know
(That's for all time)
Baby you gotta know
(That's for all time)
Baby you gotta know
(That's for all time)
Baby you gotta know
(That's for all time)
(Know that's for all time)
(Know that's for all time)
Say that you never know
(That's for all time)
Baby you gotta know
(That's for all time)
