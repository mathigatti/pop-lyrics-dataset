Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you â€” a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)

Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)
