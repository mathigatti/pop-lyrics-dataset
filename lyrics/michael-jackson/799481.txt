Memories of growing up
And working hard
Our childhood passed us by

Mom and dad
They sacrificed their wants and need
So we could reach the light
Although the times were tough for us
We knew they both worked hard
They gave us all their hearts could give
And still made room for love
We're all united
And standing strong
And still today
We're one big family

2300 jackson street
Always home
2300 jackson street
Always home

In harmony, together we'll join
Hands and sign
Our love across the land

Remember we always said,
If we got a change
We'll plan our work
And work our master plan

Although the road of life is tough
It has its ups and downs
We are the one and all
We can conquer all
We are united
And standing strong
And still today we're one big family

2300 jackson street
Always home
2300 jackson street
Always home

Mother and father
They raised us to be
The best that we could be
Now the stage is set
The curtain's up
The crowd applauds your name

Then give a smile
Let's do your best
No matter how far we go

2300 jackson street
Always home
2300 jackson street
Always home
