She wrote Dear Michael,
You'll probably never get this letter
Michael, I wrote you a hundred times before
Knowing how I feel, I'll write a hundred more


Dear Michael, everytime your record's on
Michael, I close my eyes and sing along
Dreaming you're singing to me

And then she wrote
Michael, I love you
I've held tears back long as I can
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope
Cause I wanna be more than just your number one fan

I'm gonna answer your letter
I'll start beginning with the ABCs of loving you
Your letter really touched my heart
I've been dreaming of meeting the picture
That you sent along, signed with all your love

(Michael, Michael)
(I want you)
(She wrote)
I'm gonna write you back
Ooh, I promise you that
Girl, I think I love you
Hurry, hurry Mr Postman
Take my letter
Tell her her I love her
Hurry, hurry Mr Postman
Take my letter
Tell her I love her
