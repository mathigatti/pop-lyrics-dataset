[Fala]
You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it


And then one day
You get it
It's so good too

But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good

But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones cause

[Canto]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know, know, know
I know, I know

Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
