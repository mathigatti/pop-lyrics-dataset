This is it, here I stand
I'm the light of the world, love you grand
Got this love I can feel
And I know yes for sure it is real


And it feels as though I've seen your face a thousand times
And you said you really know me too yourself
And I know that you have got addicted with your eyes
But you say you gonna live it for yourself

I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thught that I would be your lover
C'mon baby, just understand

This is it, I can say,
I'm the light of the world, run away
We can feel, this is real
Every time I'm in love that I feel

And I feel as though I've known you since 1000 years
And you tell me that you've seen my face before.
And you said to me you don't want me hanging round
Many times, wanna do it here before

I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
C'mon baby, just understand

This is it, I can feel
I'm the light of the world, this is real
Feel my song, we can say
And I tell you I feel that way

And I feel as though I've known you for a thousand years
And you said you want some of this yourself
And you said won't you go with me, on a while
And I know that it's really cool myself

I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
C'mon baby, just understand

I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
C'mon baby, just understand
