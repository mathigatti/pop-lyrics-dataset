What goes around, comes around

I've had my eyes on you
For three long years
When no one else wanted you
I took you in and held you near


But then you drifted away
After you said you'd always stay
How could you be so mean and untrue?
He didn't want you until he'd seen
What my love did for you, yeah

Oh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home

I've had no love affairs
For three long years
Remember how I used to care
When you were down, I dried your tears

Who did you think was the fool?
I let you treat me so cruel
This is the moment of truth for you
Do you think your playing is through?
I don't think I can trust you

Oh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?

What goes around, comes around
He put you down, now you're the clown

I've had my eyes on you
For three long years
When no one else wanted you
I took you in and held you near

Yeah, yeah baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Na, na, baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?

Yeah, yeah, yeah

What goes around, comes around
He put you down, now you're the clown

Yeah, yeah baby, what goes around, comes around
He put you down, now you're the clown
