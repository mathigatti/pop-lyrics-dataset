Can you feel it
Can you feel it


Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

All the colors of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who is hating his brother when hate won't do
'Cuz we're all the same
yes the blood inside of me is inside of you

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Can you feel it

You know, I was
I was wondering, you know
If, if you could keep on
Because the force has got a lot of power
And it makes me feel like
It makes me feel like

Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Keep on with the force don't stop
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Said, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

It's black, it's white
Yes we're one and the same, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's black, it's white
Yes we're one and the same
It's black, it's white
Yes we're one and the same, yeah, yeah, yeah
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
