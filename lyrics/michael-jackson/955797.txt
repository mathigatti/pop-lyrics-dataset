The suns gonna shine
The flowers are gonna grow
The clouds will bring us showers
The rivers gonna flow


Men ain\'t got no power
To kill nothing but himself
Men is a creation
Men is nothing else, so

Always into trees
Always into oceans
Always into seas

(What\'s up with you?)

We can\'t stop this world
Cause it\'s not our world
We can just
Jackie Chan it up

Even when we\'re falling
He\'s mighty patient
He\'s got your number
Beat your disease

He knows you\'re falling
You\'re falling, you\'re falling
(Falling) Men is a creation
Men is nothing more, so

Always into mountains
