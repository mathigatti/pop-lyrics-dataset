When we grow up, will I be pretty?
Will I be big and strong?
Will I wear dresses that show off my knees?
Will I wear trousers twice as long?
Well, I don't care if I'm pretty at all.
And I don't care if I never get tall. I like what you look like...
... and you're nice small.
We don't have to change at all.


When we grow up, will I be a lady?
Will I be on the moon?
Well, it might be alright to dance by its light, but I'm gonna get up there soon.
Well, I don't care if you're pretty at all.
And I don't care if you never get tall.
I like what you look like...
... and you're nice small.
We don't have to change at all.

When I grow up, I'm gonna be happy.
I'll do what I like to do.
Like making noise!
And making faces!
And making friends like you.

And when we grow up, do you think we'll see that I'm still like you and you're still like me?

I might be pretty.
I might grow tall.
But we don't have to change at all.

(Michael: I don't wanna change, see. 'Cause I still wanna be your friend. Forever and ever and ever and ever.)
