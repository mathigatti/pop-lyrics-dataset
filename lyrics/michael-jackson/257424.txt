Always be not always and if always, bow our heads in shame.
Always, please be not always.
And if always, bow our heads in blame.
'Cause time has made promises, just promises.


Faces, did you see their faces?
Did they touch you?
Have you felt such pain?
To have nothing, to dream something, then lose hoping.
Is not life but lame?
But time has made promises, just promises.

Mothers cry, babies die helplessly in arms while rockets fly and
Research lies in progress to become.

But what of men are flesh and blood?
We turn our backs on life.
How can we claim to stand for peace when the race is armed in
Strife, destroying life?

Always, be not always.
But if always, bow our heads in shame.
Always, please, be not always.
'Cause if always, bow our heads in blame.
'Cause time has made promises, just promises.
