Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it


If you look around
The whole world's coming together now, babe

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Feel it in the air
The wind is taking it everywhere, yeah

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

All the colors of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who is hating his brother
When hate won't do, hoo
'Cos we're all the same
Yes the blood inside of me is inside of you

Now tell me can you feel it
(Hee) can you feel it
Can you feel it

Now tell me
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it, yeah yeah, uhh

Every breath you take
Is someone's death in another place
('Nother place, 'nother place, 'nother place)
Every healthy smile
Is hunger and strife to another child
('Nother child, 'nother child,)
But the stars do shine
In promising salvation, is near this time
(Near this time)
Can you feel it now
So brothers and sisters show me know how

Now tell me, can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it, yeah, yeah, hu
Can you feel it, hee
Can you feel it, uh-uh
Can you feel it

All the children of the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedley, hoo
Yes it's alright
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Tell the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers when death won't do, hee
Yes we're all the same
Yes the blood inside my veins is inside of you

Now tell me can you feel it
(Tell me) can you feel it
Can you feel it, hee

(When you see was going down) can you feel it
(You feel it in your bones) can you feel it
(Can you feel it) can you feel it
