Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no


That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker

She plays a game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now she's thinking that I will never know
Ans she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same

That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker

I never thought that I
Would stop dreamin' about you, stop being without you
But everyone told me so
To stop caring about you, and start being without you
But I'll find a way to go
And start doin' without you, and stop talkin' about you
And what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away

That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker

That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker

That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker

That girl
Should have known she was a
That girl
Should have seen right through her
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
