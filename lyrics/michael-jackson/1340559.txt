Dance
Let me see you move
Dance, c'mon
Let me see you move


Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby
Love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night's gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it, 'cause

Baby
Every time I love you
In and out my life
In and out, baby
Tell me
If you really love me
It's in and out my life
In and out, baby
So, baby
Love never felt so good

Oh, baby
Love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it was ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby
Love never felt so good (so good)
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night through the thick and thin
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it cause

Baby
Every time I love you
It's in and out my life
In and out, baby
Tell me
If you really love me
It's in and out my life
Driving me crazy
Baby
Love never felt so good

Dance
Let me see you move
Let me see you move
Dance, c'mon
Let me see you move
Let me see you move
Michael

And the nights, that feels good
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it cause

Baby
Everytime I love you
It's in and out my life
In and out, baby
Tell me
If you really love me
It's in and out my life
Driving me crazy
'Cause, baby
Love never felt so good

Baby
Everytime I love you
It's in and out my life
In and out baby
Tell me
If you really love me
It's in and out my life
Driving me crazy
Cause baby
Love never felt so good

Never felt so good
It never felt so good
Never felt so good
It never felt so good
It never felt so good
