It's time you put away your fear
And it's time try to dream a little big
It's time to give your dreams another chance
And it's time to take away the will in hand


To the flames that's burning strong
To the rain that's coming on
I'll be holding on to memories
I can make it on my own

I believe I'm ready to win
I know I'm ready to soar
If you pick me up when I down
Turn it all around
I know I'm ready to win

They say it's a miracle today (Oh my)
You are never going far today (Hold on)
Life is your chance (Oh no)
You got your chance
Go get your win
It feels like I can fly with broken wings

Now the wind is blowing strong
I can do it on my own
I can do it all alone now
And I'm never turning back again

I believe I'm ready to win (Oh, my friend)
I know I'm ready to soar
If you pick me up when I am down
Turn it all around
I know I'm ready to win

They say I'm dreaming life away
(They say I'm throwing it all away)
And I can't get back my yesterday (Dream again)
So I say I never saw love without you

I believe I'm ready to win (I believe in miracles)
I know I'm ready to soar (Oh my friend)
If you pick me up when I am down
Turn it all around
Cause I know I'm ready to win

Call my name!
(I know I'm ready to win)
And I know I'm ready to win
You and me, baby
I believe it, baby
(I know I'm ready to win)
I know I will win
(I know I'm ready to win)
Sing, yeah!
Baby, I know!
(I know I'm ready to win)
Yeah, yeah, I believe
(I know I'm ready to win)
