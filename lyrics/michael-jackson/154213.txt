I can't believe that is real
The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide
I know it's you honey baby, yeah


That makes the world go round
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby come and take me

Take me by the hand
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me
Oh.. it always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
You broke my heart into half
I know it's you and me
Baby yeah...
