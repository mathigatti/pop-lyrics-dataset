Maria hey hey Maria
Maria don't you hear me calling Maria
Maria girl you know you were the only one


Hey hey Maria
Maria don't you miss me just a little
Maria after all you were the only one
Come on back to me Maria
Maria come on back to me girl

Hey hey Maria
Maria it's been long so long
Maria since you've been gone

Hey hey Maria
Maria don't you need me just a little
Maria 'cause honest girl you were the only one
Come on back to me Maria
Oh come on back to me girl

Maria I need you
Maria why d'you keep a-running away
Oh baby you keep a-running away
Oh baby yeah Maria
I need you honey

Oh Maria you sweet little sunflower
Oh hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me Maria
If you're on that lonely night

That's my life without you girl
I'm so lonely I'm so blue
Without you darling my life is through
Come on back
