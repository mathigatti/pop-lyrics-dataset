She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throws it back to me
I've spend a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say


Love is a feeling, give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire, quench my desire
Give it when I want it, talk to me woman
Give in to me, give in to me

You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling, quench my desire
Give it when I want it, takin' me higher
Love is a woman, I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me

You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay, and it's okay
You wont be laughing girl when I'm not around
I'll be okay, and I'll, I'll not find
Gotta, the peace of mind, no

Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling, quench my desire
Give it when I want it, takin' me higher
Talk to me woman, love is a feeling
Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me

Oh! Love is the feeling, I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire, takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher, satisfy the feeling
Give in to me, give in to me

I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna hear it, give it to the fire
Talk to me woman, quench my desire
I don't like a lady, talk to me baby
Give in to me

Give in to the fire, give in to me
Give in to me, give in to me
Love is a woman

Give in to me, give in to me
Give in to me, give in to me
'Cause I'm on fire, talk to me woman
Quench my desire, give in to the feelin'
