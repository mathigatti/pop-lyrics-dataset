I'm just an average man, with an average life
I work from nive to five, hey hell I pay the price
But I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone?


I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
[Oh oh oh]
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Tell me: Is it just a dream?

When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone
I'm trying to avoid
Well, can the people on tv see me or am
I just paranoid?

When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of psycho too much
That's why...

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
[Oh oh oh]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

I don't know anymore!
Are the neighbors watching me?
Well, is the mailman watching me?
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh what a mess!
I wonder: Who's watching me now?
[Who?]
The IRS?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
[Oh oh oh]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me: Is it just a dream?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
[Oh oh oh]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Uh... Oh oh oh
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me: It can't be!

I always feel like somebody's watching me...
