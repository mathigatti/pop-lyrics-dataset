There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
'Cause they're hiding everywhere


Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is this scary for you, baby
Is this scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is this scary for you, baby

There's a creaking on the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is pokin'

I am gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Perform before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night

But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

I always feel that
Somebody's watchin' me
I always feel that
Somebody's watchin' me
You're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
