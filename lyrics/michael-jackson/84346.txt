Say, say, say
What you want
But don't play games
With my affection
Take take take
What you need
But don't leave me
With no direction


All alone
I sit home by the phone
Waiting for you, baby
Through the years
How can you stand to hear
My pleading for you
You know I'm cryin

(Now) go, go, go
Where you want
But don't leave me
Here forever
You you you stay away
So long girl, I see you never

What can I do, girl
To get through to you?
'Cause I love you, baby
Standing here
Baptized in all my tears
Baby, through the years
You know I'm cryin

You never ever worried
And you never shed a tear
You're sayin that my love aint real
Just look at my face these tears aint dryin'

You, you, you
Can never say
That im not the one
Who really loves you
I pray, pray, pray, everyday
That you'll see things
Girl, like I do

What can I do, girl
To get through to you?
'Cause I love you, baby
Standing here
Baptized in all my tears
Baby, through the years
You know I'm cryin

Say say say
