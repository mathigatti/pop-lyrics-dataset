This life don't last forever (hold my hand)
So tell me what we're waitin for (hold my hand)
Better off being together (hold my hand)
Than being miserable alone (hold my hand)


Cause i've been there before
And you've been there before
But together we can be alright.
Cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold
We hold each other till we see the sunlight

So if you just hold my hand
Baby i promise that i'll do all i can
Things will go better if you just hold my hand
Nothing can come in between us if you just hold, hold my, hold my, hold my hand.

The nights are getting darker (hold my hand)
And there's no peace inside (hold my hand)
So why make our lives harder (hold my hand)
By fighting love, tonight.

Cause i've been there before
And you've been there before
But together we can be alright.
Cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold
We can just hold each other till we see the sunlight

So if you just hold my hand
Baby i promise that i'll do all i can (if you just,if you just)
Things will go better if you just hold my hand
Nothing can come in between us if you just hold,hold my,hold my hand

I can tell you're tired of being lonely(yehhh)
Take my hand dont let go baby hold me(hold mee)
Come to me let me be your one and only(hold my haand)
So i can make it alright til' the morning(hold my
Hand)

I can tell ur tired of being lonly(hold my hand)
Take my hand dont let go baby hold me(hold mee)
Come to me let me be your one and only(one and only)
So i can make it alright til' the morning(hold my
Hand)

Baby i promise that i'll do all i can (if you just,if you just)
Things will get better if you just hold my hand
Nothing can come in between us if you just hold,hold my,hold my hand
