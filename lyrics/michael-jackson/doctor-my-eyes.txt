Doctor my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears
Without crying now I want to understand


I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good
Without hiding
You must help me if you can

Doctor my eyes (eyes, eyes)
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise
To leave them open for so long (yeah) yeah

As I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will
I never noticed them until
I got this feeling that it's later than it seems

Doctor my eyes (eyes, eyes)
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries (cries, cries)
Just say if it's too late for me (oh yeah) oh yeah, oh
Yeah

Doctor my eyes (eyes, eyes)
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize
For having learned how not to cry, yeah
