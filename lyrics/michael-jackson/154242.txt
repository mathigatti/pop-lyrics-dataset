Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me


So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page
Living encaged like animals and cannibals
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Peace of mind's so hard to find.

I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now

Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces
A war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion
How we're living
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn

How can we preach, when all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine

We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other
Whatever happened to protecting each other
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever.
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and
afflicted
Family values are contradicted
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and
I've had enough

I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now
