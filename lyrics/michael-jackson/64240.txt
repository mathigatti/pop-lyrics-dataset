You know, I was
I was wondering, you know
If you could keep on
Because the force it
It's got a lot of power
And it make me feel like, ah
It, it make me feel like, ah


Lovely is the feelin' now
Fever, temperature's risin' now
Power (ah power) is the force of the vow
That makes it happen
It asks no questions why
So get closer (closer now) to my body now
Just love me 'til you don't know how

Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain't nothin' like a love desire
I'm melting (I'm melting) like hot candle wax
Sensation (ah, sensation) lovely where we're at!
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complaining
'Cause this is love power, ooh

Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Oh baby, keep on, keep on

Heartbreak, enemy despise
Eternal (ah, eternal) love shines in my eyes
So let love (oh, let love) take us through the hours
I won't be complaining (no, no)
'Cause your love is alright, alright

Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Keep on with the force, don't stop (don't stop, baby)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough (oh, my baby)
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Lovely is the feeling now
I won't be complaining (ooh!) ooh!
The force is love power

Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop (don't stop, darlin')
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Keep on with the force, don't stop (don't, please baby)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on (keep on now) with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough (keep on, darlin')
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough (love power)
Keep on with the force, don't stop (yeah)
Don't stop 'til you get enough (keep on, darlin')
