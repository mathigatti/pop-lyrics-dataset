He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate


He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fire's deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land?
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan?

Everybody sing

Every day create your history
Every path you take, you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill

No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land?
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand?

Everybody sing

Every day create your history
Every path you take, you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Every day create your history
Every page you turn, you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land?
(Lord, we need Your assistance)
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers?

And be one family, oh

(Every day create your history) history
(Every path you take, you're leaving your legacy)
(Every soldier dies in his glory) his glory
(Every legend tells of conquest and liberty)

(Every day create your history) history
(Every page you turn, you're writing your legacy)
(Every hero dreams of chivalry)
All around the world we sing
(Every child should sing together in harmony)

Yeah, yeah, together
A soldier dies (a soldier dies)
A mother cries (a mother cries)
The promised child (the promised child)
Shines in a baby's eyes

All nations sing (all nation sing)
Let's harmonize all around the world
