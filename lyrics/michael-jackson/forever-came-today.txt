(ever, forever, ever, and ever and ever)
(ever, forever, ever, and ever and ever)


There you are standing there reaching out for me
Something warm in your eyes touched my heart
And all the love i never knew
I found in you

Suddenly, my world, my life was standing still
And you touched my hand i knew that we had laid a plain
For everlasting love
I'm forever dreaming of

At last, at last
My forever came today
When you walked into my life
(made my lonely life a paradise)
(it came today, forever came today)

Ooh, look into my eyes and see how much i want you
Feel my touch, you know how much i need you
I may be young, but i'm old enough to know
Look at me, i will never let it go
Let this moment thrill me a lifetime
Make it last, make it last
Make it last forever

(ever, forever) make it last forever (ever and ever and ever)
(ever, forever, ever , and ever and ever)

Darling, ooh, my darling make me yours
As i touch your face
Tell me love has led me (led me)
To this place and your warm embrace

Thanks to you, thanks to you my search has ended
And i want the world to see how gently love has shined on me (shined on me)
With everlasting love (everlasting love)
That i been forever dreaming of

At last, at last
My forever came today
When you walked into my life (walked, walked into my life)
(my my lonely life a paradise
(it came today, forever came today)
(it came today, forever came today)

Ooh, you give me love by the hour
Ooh, you're my precious little flower
Girl, you give me so much sweetness
Ooh, you give my life completeness
Make it last for more than just a day
Make it last for more than just an hour
Make it last forever
