I was alone at dawn, she woke me
She was asleep and tired
She came inside and whispered to me
The girl is what I had inside


But she's a PYT, a pretty young thing
The girl's a PYT, she's a pretty young thing

I was upstairs she came and woke me
I was asleep and tired
She came inside my prima donna
The girl is my heavenly prize

The girl's a PYT, my pretty young thing (to me)
PYT, pretty young thing

She is always there whenever I need her
Telling me the words, that's right
Telling me things I do about her
She is just the one, Right!

The girl's a PYT, pretty young thing
The girl's a PYT (to me), pretty young thing
PYT (to me), pretty young thing
The girl's a PYT, yeah, pretty young thing

The girl's a PYT, she's my pretty young thing
The girl's a PYT, pretty young thing

I love her so
I'll never let her go
I'm loving you today
I'm loving you tomorrow
My girl, my girl, my girl
I know I love her so
