If you call out loud
Will it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis
And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
So give yourself a chance


'Cause you can climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea - hee
All you need is the will to wart it
And uhh - little self-esteem

So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You gotta know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself
No matter what it's gon' take
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith

Gon' keep it brother
You got it

And when you think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of
When you're all alone
And you can go by feel
'Stead of circumstance
But the power's in believing
So give yourself a chance

I know that you can
Sail across the water
Float across the sky - high
Any road that you take will get you there
If you only try

So keep the faith, ow
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
I told my brother
How to do the thing right
Lift up your head
And show the world you got pride
Go for what you want
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith

Gon' keep it brother
You got it

I know that keepin' the faith
Means never givin' up on love
But the power that love has to make it right
Makes it, makes it right!

So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round, brother
You gotta know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

Better stand up
And act like you wanna do right
Don't play the fool
For the rest of your life
Work on it brother
And you'll make it someday
Go for what you want
And don't forget the faith
Look at yourself
And what you doin' right now
Stand back a minute
Just to check yourself out
Straighten out your life
And how you're livin' each day
Get yourself together
'Cause you got to keep the faith

(Keep the faith)
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
(Keep the faith)
And your feet flat on the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

Lift up your mind
Before your mind gets blown
Some things in life
You best just leave them alone
Go for what you want
Don't let it get in your way
You can make it happen
But ya got to keep the faith

(Keep the faith)
Gon' keep it brother
You got to keep the faith
Yeah keep the faith
(Keep the faith)
Gon' keep it sister
You got to keep the faith - now, now
(Keep the faith)
I told my brother
How to do the thing right
Lift up your head
And show the world you got pride
(Keep the faith)
Go for what you want
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner
If you keep the faith
(Keep the faith)
Straighten out yourself
And get your mind on track
Dust off your butt
And get your self-respect back
(Keep the faith)
You've known me long enough
To know that I don't play
Take it like you want it
But you got to keep the faith

(Keep the faith)
Gon' - don't let nobody take you down
Just keep your eyes on the prize
(Keep the faith)
And your feet flat on the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

But till that day
I said you've got to keep the faith!
