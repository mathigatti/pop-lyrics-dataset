How long I have left?
For the night not dawn
I have one more chance
Me dream of you


Clouds of water cover your sky
Going to rain today!

Hopefully rain drops of honey

What kind of dream I ?

You're a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare ?
Anyway do not want to wake you

Feeling now is the first thing
And I feel love for you

Everynight I feel you
Then I can only feel you in dream

What kind of dream I ?

You're a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare ?
Anyway do not want to wake you

All my beautiful dreams are yours
baby, do not want to wake you !!
