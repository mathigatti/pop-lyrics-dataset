Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for


The way you make me feel, babe
You really turn me on (alright)
You knock me off of my feet
Hee
My lonely days are gone
Ooh

I like the feeling you're giving me
Just hold me closer baby, I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be working from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before

Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
Cuz you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
Now baby, hee]
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
My lonely days are gone
Ooh
Go on girl

I never felt so in love before
Promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
Cuz you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet darling
Now baby, hee
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
My lonely days are gone

Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
Hee, hee

Give me some time
Come on be my girl

Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby's
