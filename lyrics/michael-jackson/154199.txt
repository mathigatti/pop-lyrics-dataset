He's gone!


Every where I turn no matter where I look
The systems in control its all ran by the book
I gotta get away so I can free my mind
Escape is what I need
(lectric') lectric eyes

No matter where I am I see my face around
They pin lies on my name and put them town to town
Don't have a place to run but there's no need to hide
I got ta
Find a place
So I can hide away

Escape
Gotta get away from the system, rules and the world today
Escape
The pressure that I feel from relationships had to go away
Escape
The man with the pen that writes the lies that has no ink
Escape
I do what I wanna cuz I gotta be nobody but me

Sometimes I feel like... I've gotta get away

I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games
Time to make a change
Why is it I cant do whatever I want to? (hoah)
When in my personal life friend i dont live for you (you!)
So don't you try to (don't you try it) tell me what is right for
me
To be con cerned about you
I cant do what I want to

Escape (I got to)

Escape

Escape
I do what I wanna cuz I gotta be nobody but me (Get away!)

Escape

Escape

Escape
