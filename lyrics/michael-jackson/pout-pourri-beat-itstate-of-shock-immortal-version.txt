They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it.


You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just Stop!!!

You wanna see who's bad?
You wanna see who's bad?
C'mon, c'mon let's do it
Let's see who's bad
Come on, c'mon, let's go!

Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad?
I'm telling me (I'm telling me)
You're doing wrong (You're doing wrong)
Your lucky world (Your lucky world)
About too long (About too long)

You're doing wrong (You're doing wrong)
You're doing wrong (You're doing wrong)
You're doing wrong, boy (You're doing wrong, boy)
You're doing wrong (You're doing wrong)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad, bro? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)

Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong, who's right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
