Oooh
Foolish of me, I couldn't see 
The forest for the trees 
You've been so true 
I've been so cruel to you 
Oh, girl please don't leave me


Chorus : 
If you stay I'll find a way 
To erase the past 
Baby don't leave me 
Girl don't take your love from me 
Oh girl 

What can I say to make you stay 
Baby, don't leave me 
You've been so kind 
It blows my mind to know
Oh girl, I really hurt you  

Chorus : 
Tell me girl, it's not to late 
And you give me a chance 
To make it up to you 
Don't take your love from me 
Girl don't take your love 
Don't take your love 

Bridge: 
Girl, if you take your love away from me 
I'm gonna be in misery 
Your love is the strength that I lean upon 
How will I make it when it's gone 
Of all the little things I wanted to say.... 
...I really wanted to do
Girl , this time...
Ooh, oh girl I really mean it 

Chorus : 
So tell me girl, it's not too late 
And you'll give me a chance 
To make it up to you 
Don't take your love from me 
Don't take your love, no no no no no
Don't take your love
Don't leave me girl 

Don't take your love from me 
Baby, don't take your love from me 
Don't take your love from me 
Oooh, don't take your love from me 
Baby, don't take your love from me
