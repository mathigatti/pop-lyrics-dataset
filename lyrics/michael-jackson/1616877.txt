We can do it nice and slow

Sex o'clock it's getting dark
And do all alone
So dim the lights, lock the door
Baby, come on


'Cos I've waited for this moment
For so long
I don't want just anybody
Who wants to get it on
I don't think that I can
hold my feelings
Back no more
So baby, please stop
Ooh, it's getting hot
Girl, you better not
Why you always wanna tease me

I don't wanna waste no time
So bring your body close to mine
We can do it nice and slow
And easy
(I don't wanna waste)
I don't wanna waste no time
So baby, just let it all unwind
Girl, don't tease me

Well it's time
Let your mind
Blow the horn
Come a little closer baby
Don't be afraid
Let me show you the
way to my love
Come on

'Cos I need somebody
do love me all night long
I don't want just anybody
Who wants to get it on
(I don't wanna waste no time)
I don't think that I can
hold my feelings
Anymore
So baby, please stop
Ooh, it's getting hot
Girl you better not
Why you always wanna tease me

I don't wanna waste no time
(why you wanna tease)
Don't tease me
(No)
We can do it nice and slow
(I don't understad)
Why you wanna tease

(I don't understand)
Tease, tease me
I don't wanna waste no time
Why you wanna tease,
don't tease me
Girl, don't tease me
(tease me, tease me)

I don't wanna waste no time
So bring your body close to mine
(tease me)
We can do it nice and slow
And easy
(don't tease me, baby)
I don't wanna waste no time
Baby, just let it all unwind
Girl, don't tease me

Why you wanna tease me
(Tease me)
Tease me
(Tease me)
Why you wanna tease me
(Tease me)
Say why you wanna, why
you wanna, why you,
why you, why you wanna
tease me
(Tease me)
Why you wanna tease me
(Tease me, tease me)
No, no, no, no, no

(repeat chorus to end)
