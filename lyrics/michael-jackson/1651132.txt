If I don't love you this way
If I don't love you this way


If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say, yeah
If I don't need you this much
Why do I ache for your touch, yeah

With you it seems
I can reach the stars
With reckless hopes and dreams
But you it seems
Still don't believe
How valuble you are
I'm really loving you
Not pretending to

If I don't love you this strong
Why do I beg to belong, yeah
How can you doubt that I care
When I'm with you everywhere, yeah

With you I find
I can close my eyes
To the world surrounding me
And you create
The sweetest things
That I could ever be
I'm really loving you
Not pretending to

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say, yeah
If I don't need you this much
Why do I ache for your touch, yeah

You just have to smile
To make my life worth while
Doesn't that explain
That I'm playing no games

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say, yeah
If I don't need you this much.
