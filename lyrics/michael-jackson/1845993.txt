(verse1)
Is it me or did i just catch you digging on me
Girl if you like what you see
You must be reading my mind
Cause girl i'm checking for you to.


(pre-chorus)
It's so incredible, just how you came to me
Girl it's like deja vu when i look at you (yeah)
It's undeniable, that you were meant for me
Girl like the morning light shine, you were here by design

(chorus)
So lets go all night long
I just got to have you
I can't wait no more
Your body's talking to me
Lets get on the floor
So we can do the dizzle all night long
All night long

(verse 2)
Baby we should get out there and make history
The chemistry is right between you and me (yeah)
Girl we can make this our song and we can party till the dawn
It's incredible

(pre-chorus)
It's so incredible, just how you came to me
To me, it's like deja vu every time i look at you
It's undeniable, that you were meant for me
Like the morning light shine, you were here by design

(chorus)
So lets go all night long (oh yeah)
I just got to have you
I can't wait no more
Your body's talking to me
Lets get on the floor
So we can do the dizzle all night long
All night long
