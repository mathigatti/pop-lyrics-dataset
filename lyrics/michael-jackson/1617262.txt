Hoo!

Live and sin
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning
I promised I would never, ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning


Hee! Hee!

As we walked into the room
There were faces staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said, "Welcome to your doom."
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me!

We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom
There were two girls sitting in my room
She walked up to my face
Said: This is the place
You said meet you right here at noon

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I am undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other

Hee! Hee!

Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's a trial thought in beguile to hurt me
This is scaring me!
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years!
This is scaring me!

We came to this place, where the vicious dwell
Found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through!

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

Someone stop my heart!
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Hee!
Ten years ago today!
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Hee!

Hoo!

Someone stop my heart!
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Hee!
Ten years ago today!
They took my mind!
Oo!
You broke my baby's heart!
This is Heartbreak Hotel
You spoken through to me!
Whoo!
