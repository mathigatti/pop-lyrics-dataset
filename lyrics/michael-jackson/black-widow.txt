Hah!
Go!
Yea, girl
Aaow!


She drinks to your mind
She drinks 'til you faint
You walk in the line
She's making you stay
She's keeping the count
She's making you pay
She's ready again
Get ready again

She needs you, boy
She wants you, boy
She haunts you, boy
Don't you see she got me thinking

Black widow woman (you're dirty, baby)
In a web of seduction (stop lying, baby)
She's a lucky filled woman
She has something to say (you're dirty, you're nasty)
(You ain't no friend of mine)
She's the one, the one for me

She fed you a line
You brought it this time
Connecting the dots
You wouldn't decline
The look in her eyes
You're telling me so
The truth is a lie
The truth is untold

She needs you, boy
She wants you, boy (yeah!)
She haunts you, boy
You, you, you, got you, baby

Black widow woman (you're dirty, baby)
In a web of seduction (stop lying, baby)
She's a lucky filled woman
She has something to say
(You're dirty, you're dirty, you're dirty)
She's the one, the one for me
(You're dirty, baby)

And with your love, I feel at home

Aaow!
Go!
Hoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo!
Hoo!
You ain't no friend of mine
Hoo!

You're dirty
You're haunted
You're doing it
You're nasty
You're nasty, but I love you, girl

Black widow woman (you're dirty, dirty)
In a web of seduction (you're nasty, baby)
She's a lucky filled woman
She has something to say
She's the one, the one for me

Black widow woman (you're dirty, baby)
In a web of seduction (you're doing it, baby)
She's a lucky filled woman
She has something to say
She's the one, the one for me
(You ain't no friend of mine)

Black widow woman
In a web of seduction (yeah, you're dirty)
She's a lucky filled woman (you're dirty)
She has something to say
She's the one, the one
(Go!)
