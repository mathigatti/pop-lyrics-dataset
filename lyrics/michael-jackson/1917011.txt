Now I got a mission
The story unfolds
What the wise men have told you, is already known
That a woman and a man
Should go by the plan
And we find out how high we can fly


There's just one religion
One family of love
We suffer the children
As God cries above
And the giving, not the taking
With hearts open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare
And what of our world
What does it become
When the damage is done
And you held out, you said no, you stand up

[Michael]
Only God knows
That it's all in the game
It's all in your name
Carry me to the gates of paradise
They're the same
It's all in your name

[Barry]
Look to Heaven
An angel of peace
To love and protect us
Through all of our tears
And the gateway to peace
It stands open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare
And where is the peace
We're searching for
Under the shadows of war
Can we hold out, and stand up, and say no

[Michael]
Only God knows
That it's all in the game
It's all in your name
Follow me to the gates of paradise
They're the same
It's all in your name

[Barry]
Can we wait and I'll be there
Loving you and understand you
Need your life now and understand
They'll all know

Michael:
It's over

[Barry]
Then we'll all know

[Michael]
It's over

[Michael]
See? that it's done

[Barry]
And it's all in your name

[Michael]
It's all in the game
It's all in your name
Follow me through the gates of paradise
They're the same (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

It's all in the game
It's all in your name
Follow me through the gates of paradise
They're the same
They're the same (yeah yeah)

It's all in the game
It's all in your name
Follow me through the gates of paradise
They're the same

It's all in your name
