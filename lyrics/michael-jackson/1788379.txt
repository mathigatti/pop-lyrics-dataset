What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta


What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta

What you're gonna do, cause I'm gonna get you
No way to run no way to hide
All the things you've said
And the things you've done to me
You can no longer make me cry

Look what you've done to me, baby
I can no longer smile, baby
And I've waited so long, just to carry on
I'm the blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (gangsta)
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(I'm the blue gangsta)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I could never fall in love)
The blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (what you're gonna do)
Look what you've put me through
Now I'm the blue gangsta (aaaah)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta

You've tricked me nine to five
Loving you is a crime
People telling me
You've got another guy
I've been abused
Watch me light in defuse
Said you'd be my wife
Nothing but big lies

Don't know what I've done
Everything you've got
Things you've done to me
Are coming back to you
You know just what I've done
The things you've done to me
I'm the blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (oh no)
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(I'm the blue gangsta)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta

What you're gonna do (what you're gonna do)
You ain't no friend of mine
(what you're gonna do)
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (naah)
(Look what you've done girl)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta

See, I am so amused
To the things you've said
And the things you have done to me
There is nothing in this world
Make me change

Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you've put me through (Baby)
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(Aaaah)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta (blue gangsta)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(what you're gonna do)
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(look what you've put me through, baby!)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I never thought I fall in love)
The blue gangsta

What you're gonna do (what you're gonna do)
You ain't no friend of mine (what you're gonna do)
Look what you've put me through
(look what you've put me through, girl)
Now that I'm the blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I never wanna fall in love)
The blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(you ain't no friend of mine)
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(you ain't no friend of mine)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I never thought I fall in love)
The blue gangsta

What you're gonna do (what you're gonna do do)
You ain't no friend of mine
(look what you've put me through)
Look what you've put me through (what are you gonna do)
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (what you're gonna do)

(I never thought I fall in love)
The blue gangsta
