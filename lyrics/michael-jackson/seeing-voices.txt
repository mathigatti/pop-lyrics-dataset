I sing of what you see and might think about
Because of what you see
Moving hands, mobile faces
Where by the eye not the ear traces
What's on the mind


So when you see hands
Weaving the space between friends
Think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices

Speech without sound
Face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices

Believe it they ramble on exactly as we would
And talking with someone we know
And even they stumble on expressions as we would
And talking with anyone

So

When you see hands weaving
The space between friends
Think of them as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
So think of hands as being
As though you were seeing voices

So when you see hands
Weaving the space between friends
Think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices

Speech without sound
Face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices

So think of hands as asking or telling
Or spelling out choices
Just think of hands as being
As though you were seeing, voices

Just think of hands as being
As though you were seeing
Voices, voices
Voices
