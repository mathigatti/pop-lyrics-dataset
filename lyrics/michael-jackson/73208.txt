Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart


No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around like a child
But pardon me

People say I'm not ok
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates and adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on a throne

Before you judge me
Try hard to love me
Look within your heart then ask:
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare watch me fly

Before you judge me
Try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had
Have you seen my childhood?
