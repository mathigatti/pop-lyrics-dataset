Feeling like this is the end of the world
Missing on the chance to fall in love (I do got it)
Feeling like your love is dangerous, but I love you, girl
Feeling like I'm never good enough
Let the heaven open, it's raining in heaven
Feels like warm july


We'll be something new, I'm here for you
And there's no need to cry

Heaven's like water, water
Drowning my love, it feels like
Heaven's like water, water
People leave me alone
Heaven's like water, water
What am I to do?

Feeling like this is the start of something new
Feeling like this is the world of me and you
Cause you ain't judging me, you just touching me
You ain't bugging me, I'm waiting on you
I'm hoping it's true, baby, it's you
When the storm is ranging
We can walk the moon

Girl, I love you, you're my fortune
You keep me alive

Heaven's like water, water
Drowning my soul, it feels like
Heaven's like water, water
People leave me alone
Heaven's like water, water
What am I to do?

I lie awake, I count the days
When I'm not there with you, I cry my eyes away
I'd rather stay, I rather play again
When I'm not there with you forever, always
(Water, water)
Don't you do this to me

Tell the angels no
I don't wanna leave my baby alone
Won't you leave us alone
Tell the angels no
I don't wanna leave my baby alone

It feels like, leave us alone
(Water, water)
Leave us alone, it feels like
(Water, water)

How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
(Water, water, water)
(It's like water, water)

All over me, it's all over me
(It's like water, water, like water)
All over me, it's all over me, it's all
All over me (water)
It's all over me
(Water, it's like water, water)
