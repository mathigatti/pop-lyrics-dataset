All along, I had to talk about it
But like a two edged sword
It cuts you and it stabs me


All along, I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world

You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place

You say you love me but it's hard to see
'Cause when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know

Who do you love?
I don't want ya
If you can't answer
You know me

(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry, girl (cry girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)



I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you
You're sitting in your room

You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask
So I can see your face

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know

Who do you love?
I don't want ya
If you can't answer
I know you

(Heaven must be wearing)
Heaven must be wearing
(Your smile is scary)
You got me scared, girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, yours are good
You got me scared, girl

(Heaven must be wearing)
Heaven must be wearing
(Your smile is scary)
You got me scared, girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, yours are good
You got me scared, girl

I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
And when I come to you
You're sitting in your room

You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask
So I can see your face

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know

Who do you love?
I don't know
I don't wanna talk about it
(let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it
(let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it
(let's talk about it)
