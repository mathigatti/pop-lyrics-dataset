When I was a child
I cried on mama's shoulder
She would look at me and say:
When you grow older
You will come to know
The joy and love of one good man
Everything will come in time
If you believe it
Anything you truly want
You can echive it
Picture the love you'll find
With one good man


Some day a price will come your way
He'll smile at you and say
He's waited all his life
For someone like you
And if the love is real
Within you heart you'll feel
I'm yours for life
Cuz you're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me

Many years have past away since mama told me
I hadn't find a man
To love, to have and hold me
There where many men
But not of them one good man
I began to dout that I would
Find my true love
But then at one noon it happened
I found you, love
You were like a dream come true
You were that one good man

Some day a price will come your way
He'll smile at you and say
He's waited all his life
For someone like you
And if the love is real
Within you heart you'll feel
I'm yours for life
Cuz you're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me

It's true, I knew from that day on
My lonely days were gone
Those lonely tears I've cried
Since you are by my side
Now and forever more
You'll be with me
And we will love
You are my everything

When I was a child I cried
On mama's shoulder
She would look at me and say:
When you grow older
You'll find a man to love
And now I see that
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me
