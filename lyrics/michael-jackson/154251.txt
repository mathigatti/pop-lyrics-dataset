Love is like a circus and a carnival is beautiful to see
Love can turn your mind around like ferris wheels and spinning
Carosels


You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze

Oh, everyday is a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, love
Is the greatest show on earth

The fantasy you see is like a child again through rainbow
Colored eyes
Step right up its circus time and get your moneys worth of love
Today


You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze

Everyday is a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, yeah
Is the greatest show on earth


Everyday is a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, love
Is the greatest show on earth


Love, love, love
Is the greatest show on earth (yeah e yeah)
Love, love, yeah
Is the greatest show on earth
Love, love, yeah
