The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl


The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl i could not trust
The girl is bad
The girl is dangerous

I never knew, but i was walking the line
Come go with me, I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cries she left me standing alone

Shes so dangerous, The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
but your no damn good for me

She came at me in sections
Whit the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin, a touch, a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point, of no return

Deep in the darkness of passions insanity
I left taken by lusts, Strange inhumanity
The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was living in vain
She called my house
You said, "You know my name"
(She caught me)
"And don't you pretend you never did me before"
(Don't you, don't you do it)
With tears in her eyes my baby walked out the door

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous

I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damned lover
Friend of mine

I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulations
You hurt my baby

And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of a strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil
But her inner spirit as sharp
As a two-edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
