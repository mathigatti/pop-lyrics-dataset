I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
"People... It feels so good to be back.."
And to the Republic for which it stands,
One nation, under God, indivisible with liberty
And Justice for all.
Mosh with me now...


Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, reenergize, and rewind.
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercize my right to express when I feel it's time.
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight and you take it as "I'm gonna whip someone's ass".
If you don't understand don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin'
And juggling both perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Whose has had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure moving past that
Mister "kiss his ass-crack" he's a class act
Rubber band man yeah he just snaps back

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed carry on give me hope, give me strength,
come with me, and I won't stear you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light, of the end, of the tunnel, we gon' fight,
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors

All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together let's all form and stomp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color all that matters is we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yea the wetter the better
They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we're stronger now more then never,
They tell us no we say yeah, they tell us stop we say go,
Rebel with a rebel yell raise hell we gonna let'em know
Stomp push, shove, mush, fuck Bush, until they bring our troops, come on just . . .

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed carry on give me hope, give me strength,
come with me, and I won't stear you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light, of the end, of the tunnel, we gon' fight,
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors

Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us,
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's trying to tell us something maybe this is .God just saying
we're responsible for this monster, this coward, that we have empowered
This is Bin Laden, look at his head nodding'
How could we allow something like this, Without pumping our fist
Now this is our, final hour
Let me be the voice, and your strength, and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme, just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply it by six
Teen million people are equal of this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al Quaida through my speech
Let the President answer on high anarchy
Strap him with AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our soil
No more psychological warfare to trick us to think that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies, the stars and stripes
Have been swiped, washed out and wiped,
And Replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight you'll know why, because I told you to fight

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed carry on give me hope, give me strength,
come with me, and I won't stear you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light, of the end, of the tunnel, we gon' fight,
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors

And as we proceed, to mosh through this desert storm, in these closing statements, if they should argue, let us beg to differ, as we set aside our differences, and assemble our own army, to disarm this weapon of mass destruction that we call our president, for the present, and mosh for the future of our next generation, to speak and be heard, Mr. President, Mr. Senator
