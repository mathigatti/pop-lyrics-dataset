She won our hearts the arts she loved 
Is painting pictures for free 
When she was done she hung them up 
For all the children to see 
Goodbye April lady 
It's been good to have you around 
Goodbye April lady 
You've done a lot for the folks in this town 
The children learned to read 
She strung their beads 
It's sorry she was the one 
As you can see isn't she good 
She don't leave nothing undone 
Goodbye April lady 
It's been good to have you around 
Goodbye April lady 
You've done a lot for the folks in this town 
She taught them all to love 
She was their cream 
And we don't want her to go 
But we know too well 
She fell in love 
And there's no stopping her so 
Goodbye April lady 
It's been good to have you around 
Goodbye April lady 
You've done a lot for the folks in this town 
Goodbye April lady...
