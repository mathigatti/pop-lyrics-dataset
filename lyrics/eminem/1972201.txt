I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart


I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it

I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

I'm the man in my city ain't nobody wit me
You can ask the real niggaz and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50&amp;#8242;s
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26&amp;#8242;s watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stolen' the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices' try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now shoulda seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and dare her to have children?
Hope he got some insurance 'cause death her is enduring?
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
The gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous

I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart
