Blow My Buzz
Eminem &amp; D12


Swifty:
Yo, this is one of those days when yo' ass just wanna chillout.
And motherfuckers be all in yo' where and shit...
And that naggin bitch, it's just like to hear herself talk...
Blowin all yo' high away. Yeah, that's some fucked up shit.
But it happens, youknowimsayin?
(Yeah, yeah)

[Eminem]
Schizophrenia
How many of you got it?
How many motherfuckers can say they psychotic?
How many motherfuckers can say
They brains dryrotted from pot?
You got it like I got it or not?
If you did you would know just what I'm talking 'bout
When your tongue's rotting out from cotton mouth
When you end up becoming so dependent on weed
That you end up spending a G
In the vending machine
You got the munchies
Look at you
Junk food junkie
Potato chips and lunch meat
Up in the front seat
Sometimes you can get so paranoid from ganja
That it's got you thinking the whole world is watching ya
Or maybe you don't smoke
Maybe you just grow
But whatever your drugs, yo
Go for the gusto
Just don't
Come fuck with me when I'm doing my drugs
You see me in the club don't come fucking my high up and

[Chorus]
Blow my buzz
Do what you want to just don't
Blow my buzz
Then I'm gon' sit here and just
Roll my drugs
And if you talk I'm gonna
Fuck you up
Just don't say shit and we'll be cool

[Bizarre]
Bitch let me in the house
(Ay Von?)
Naw, just came to each your mother out
It's the big guy
Doing the butterfly to the ground
Go 'head
(Bizarre, sit your nasty ass down)
I spot this fat bitch from across the room
Now suck my dick while your boyfriend's in the bathroom (ya ya)
My face is pink
Looking for a sink
And don't worry 'bout what I put in your drink
It's called a date rape drug
Ten minutes you'll be fucked up
Open your nasty ass legs up (ya you whore)
Bitches I'm catching
Blunts I'm matching
Don't call me Bizarre
I'm the Reverend Jesse Jackson

[Swifty]
Who the fuck is this guy?
Why the hell you in my presence?
It'd be cool if you was asking me some reasonable questions(damn)
But you on some bullshit nigga
This your last beer (for real)
Get the fuck off my dick
And tell your bitch to bring her ass here
I kick a hoe out
Without giving a cat fear (uh huh)
And leave her barefooted just for nagging in my damn ear
When I'm out eating
You fags interfere
They don't go until I let 'em know a mac is sitting here
I get drunk and I smoke weed
What your ass wanna hear?
I didn't answer you clear?
I meant Manson is here, ok?
You want some lle'?
I'll front your ass some play
But other than that get the hell out my face
Because you niggas trying to

Chorus

[Kuniva &amp; Kon Artis]
Yo, Denaun, you seem shook
I really am, dog, look
This fat bitch keep chasing me
Trying to give me the nook'
Ah man, you probably led her on
I just bought her a beer
I saw her rubbing on your ear
While she was wiping your tears
I admit, I was high
But you ain't see me crying
Nigga, you lying and you blowing my high
Just stop denying it
Well at least somebody in this bar is
This big bitch did
The ultimate by saying she wanted to have my kid
Look man, you grown
Just leave me alone
I'm in the zone
Call it a night
Get stoned
And take that fat slut home (take her ass home)
Just quit the drank
Hit the dank
Do some drugs (man)
Go kill yourself
Fuck you
Well stop blowing my buzz

[Proof]
I'm at the front of the bar
By the lounge in the back
With a slut on my arm
While I'm downing the yac
Got the pills in my system
Floating around
Everytime I start drifting
Someone open they mouth
Yo, my ear been spit, licked, and freestyled in (Yo, my flow iscool my whole crew)
I think I'm going Def like Mos senile men
Only one good demo outta three thousand
(Yo, I ain't wanna rap for you anyway)
(Aiight, aiight)
Peace out then
Next nigga that bump me
I'ma do the humpty
And elbow bitches
Till everybody jump me
(Yo man, what's up with you man? Why do you keep on ??
Fuck you! What's up man!? What's up!?)

Chorus

Outro:
We'll be cool
We'll be cool if you don't talk right now. I'm just tryna smokemy weed
Smoke my weed. I'm tryna drink with my niggas, just shut the fuckup
While I am sittin here with Jolene (?)
Smokin rolls...
