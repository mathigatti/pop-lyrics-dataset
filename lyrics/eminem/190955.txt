The invasion, green line, the infiltration, we commin'
I got 50 cent, i got g-unit
D-twizzy in this bitch, wit obie trice
So watch what you say, before you call our name,
Cus you say one more thing, and it won't be nice


Here we go i shoulda known i was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later you little haters are too jealous of us to love us
You hated it g-unit made it and obie's comin, d-twizzy's comin you sick to ya stomach
Fifty percent of it is 50 cent the other 50% of it is who's color of skin it is
But if you even consider takin our label down
You better find our building and fly a fuckin plane into it
But i ain't tryin to get too intervene into it
I'm just tryin to give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cuz then it's gonna get to the point where it escalades into some other shit
Then i'm a flip
Then i'm a get to stompin' in my air force one
So you won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or its one
It's gonna feel like it's so many feet kickin' you
You think nike just made these into cleats in the shoe
I don't know what it is or what i could be
But i get a woody when these pussy's try to push me
Thinkin' the gon' put me into the position to pickle me
Ya'll tickle me pink i think i'd just rather have pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock tickoty tock tickoty a little bit of the diggity dock diggity mixed with a little bit of the jiggit ja jicket
With a small pinch of biggie
Look at me i'm just the bomb diggity
