So look straight into my eyes,
Tell me the truth and not lies
Now I understand
Now I understand
Too good to be true our worlds collide
Tell me the truth and not lies
Now I understand
Now I understand


It started off nice a dream I slept through
I felt so good a touch so gental
You was everything you was on my mental
I was your pad and you was my pencil
You were the words I was the instrumental
Without an us theres no song to sing to
You were the match the gas that lit you
You were the fire inside me that lit through
You were the air that kept me alive
When I could barely breathe and felt dead
Inside
And my whole life felt like it was at its end
Then I saw your face and my smile came
Back again!
Things turned up when I was close to you
You reserrected me yea I rose to you
No one loved me this much only you
But I didnt know what the hell I was
Supposed to do!

So look straight into my eyes,
Tell me the truth and not lies
Now I understand
Now I understand
Too good to be true our worlds collide
Tell me the truth and not lies
Now I understand
Now I understand

No more lies ima let you know
Now how much I feel for you
Nomore holding back what I feel
And who I wouldnt kill for you
I'm still here with a heart
Big enough to pump this blood through
Both of us
To the people that deny what we have
They can choke on big ol swollen nuts
They can hate let em hate
I'm getting so damn sick of them
We jumped over lust and fell in love
We dont gotta prove shit to them
How can I say how much you mean
To me without sounding so damn stupid
I dont think you understand I love you
So much its so confusing

So look straight into my eyes,
Tell me the truth and not lies
Now I understand
Now I understand
Too good to be true our worlds collide
Tell me the truth and not lies
Now I understand
Now I understand

We've been through shit and we keep going
Through it
Passion and dedication
Dedicate ourselves to us and we can make
It
Through anything we can take it
No matter the weather, we stay wet
Together in the rain and the hurricane
Hold my hand baby and we can beat it, love
Is pain
Its so insane we stuck we cant leave it
Nope it wont let us so let us get wetter!
Fuck it
Lets dance in this rain get now get up!
Katrina couldnt wash away my love
For you even if we let her!
Cuz baby I'm too tied to you
We can make it through I wont lie to you
You think this weather is strong?
Just hold on and see what the fuck I can do!

So look straight into my eyes,
Tell me the truth and not lies
Now I understand
Now I understand
Too good to be true our worlds collide
Tell me the truth and not lies
Now I understand
Now I understand
