"Fuck it, Friends or no friends I had enough bullshit
to last me clear to the ends"[4x]


[Eminem]
I shoulda been able to see that you were the one
behind this
but i was blind as fuck to think that you were the
kind that stuck some more in the spine this
It was another friendship broke in half
and watch you turn everything into a game and joke and
laugh
and both of us know we can't discuss the situation
Like adults each confrontation just results in
accusations and insults
so I'm just let it go from that
we need to be I told you now, from that
what goes around comes back around
believe me, duck from that, come here you fuckin...

[Chorus : Proof]
Come here you fuckin backstabber
why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you fuckin backstabber
why i oughta, be the nigga that's up to no good, haha

[Eminem]
Take a second to stop and think about what you done
and you woulda thought that being a friend, Instead of
what you won
All because of what you run your mouth
you wanna prance around and gloat?
let's see how well you dance around
when i got my hands around your throat
Cause It's a matter of time till I get my blows in and
it won't be long
You shouldn't go walkin around and stickin your nose
in where it don't belong
Cause everytime you talked when you was stretchin the
truth
There's gonna be one more flyin' knuckle you're gunna
catch in the tooth
come here, come here you fuckin...

[Chorus : Proof]
Come here you fuckin backstabber
why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you little backstabber
why i oughta, be the nigga that's up to no good, haha

[Eminem]
Come here you lil double-crossing goin behind my back
snitchin
good for nothin but trouble causin instigating fact
switcher
you were the least that i suspected
Until the puzzle well into place with every peice that
I selected
But I'll never let that crap happen again
You come backstabbin' again
catch it smack dab in the chin
that's for backstabbin a friend
cause every name in the book
wouldn't be enough
so i just figured I'd say your name in the hook
check it out, come here you fuckin....

[Chorus : Proof]
Come here you fuckin backstabber
why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you little backstabber
why i oughta, be the nigga that's up to no good, haha

[Outro :Proof]
Backstabbers don't live too long
Around my way friendships betrayed
In the hood you die for that!
For those that don't love this combat and verbally say
this
This could relate to the death of a backstabber
That's like the desire to make social distant
vibration combustion of the neck
The backstabber for the female, you sleezin ass bitch
nigga!
So remember, the backstabber always loses in the end
A friend is a friend to the end
F-R-I for Fri, E-N-D a friend for the end.....yes
To eternity.....the backstabber shall never flourish
Take em out.......
