[DJ scratching] - "Do it!"

[Eminem]

Sneakin in through the back door, fruity MC's get ambushed
Rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed
Then I'm movin on down from the right to left
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death
To get jacked, attacked and cracked in two
Smackin through 'til youre black and blue for actin true
I'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands
Proof that I be sniffin on aerosol cans
I'm stompin, I'm kickin, I'm chokin, I'm stampin em
clompin em, stickin, and pokin and clampin em
To electric chairs and tightenin bolts
Hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts
I'm zappin, rappers, singers, and dancers
Faster than you could snap your fingers for ransom
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathin
Survivin by connivin and theivin


[DJ scratching] - "Do it!", "Eat em up"


[Eminem]

I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters
It felt like I was bein attacked by spiders
Developin a fear of biterphobia
I'm holdin a gas can and lighter over ya
If I detect ya, I'ma pulverize
Dissect your brain, diggin in your skull for lies
And I'ma torture, with material iller
than a stark ravin mad serial killer
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is
A major risk to a plagiarist
So beware of the aura, A terror for the horrible
Will scare ya tomorrow, is the airbourne assault of the rappers
Hit the source to better my skills,
I head for the border
And run the Galloping Hills, the choice is yours
Cause now buddy's noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse
Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage yours to bite like labradors
In the range of my double-barrel
And your life is in danger, trouble, and peril

[Eminem]

I trample and stamp liars, like they were campfires
Cuz vampires right on my balls like clamp pliers
And swing on my big thingamajig
So I'm bringin my nig Proof for backup when I sing at my gig
Cause biters are fallin head over heels
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels
That's how I became paranoid
Chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with
an ultimatum I assault and slayed em
with rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em
Energetic and imaginative,
pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives
Will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10
That's why I'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen
