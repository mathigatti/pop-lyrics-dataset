So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cuz I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick

[Eminem]
Two pills I pop, till my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid 20's
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fighting with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fucking wasp in the hospital, lost
Stinging the fuck out of everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife by the blade and stab you with the fucking handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds hurtin'
(Bitch, it's too late)
'Cuz once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

[Swifty]
I'm an instigator, three-eighty slug penetrator
They bring creative murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known to the equator
They knew I did it, for having blood on my gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double-barreled gaugean
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in your face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Henny I do shit on purpose
You'll never hear me say forgive me
I'm snatchin' every penny, it's gotta be that way
Nigga face it, that weed I sold to you? Regate laced it
You had it, I'll make the President get a face-lift
Niggas just afraid, handing me their bracelets
Chilling in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kaluha and Gin, and throw up on themic
Don't like this rule, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cuz I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick
'Cuz I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cuz I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick

[Bizarre]
I'm a compulsive liar, set my preacher on fire
Slash your tires, find out, thinkin they're mine
Plate's expired, so as soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jacking my dick off in a band of barbed wires
Hey, is Bizarre performing?
Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
Aren't you a male dancer?
Naw bitch, I'm retired, for fuckin' a bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for letting the record skip
Letting the record skip - letting the record skip (damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost $300 dollars to get my pitbull an
Abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches are hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom

[Proof]
Ayo flashback, two seats, too deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with something, nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hashrats
At a Stop The Violence rally
I blast gats, be it a mom or publishing
Get your ASCAP-ed, the Kuniva, divider
Yo cash that, run your motherfucking pockets
ASAP, I don't need a platinum chain
Bitch, I'll snatch Shaq's, born loser
Half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns, and get laughed at
Bitch smack 'em, rich rappers get ejac-jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

[Kuniva]
We stranglin' rappers to the point they can't yell
'Cuz their crew is full of fags, sweeter than bake sells
Wreckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Cruising and causing more trouble than nine hoodlums
I rattle your Adam's apple untill it crackles
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, 'cuz I'm a looney
I got an adept mind, and it's polluted
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs, and young ballers
Shoot up they household, even the young toddlers
Brigades barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets wrap you bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doing a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva yo-yo
I'll leave your face leaking
Run up in church and smack the preacher while he's preaching
Take a swing at the deacon

[Kon Artis]
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight untill I got caught selling 'em shaped
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for having sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter
My brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimming in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery)
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped an advancement and run
Drive by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not giving me none
Born straight up out a pussy, but the son of a gun
Got a reputation for having niggas run up they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was full of some ones
Till I met your fat mama, now I'm rolling in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cuz I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick
'Cuz I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cuz I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick

Suck my motherfucking dick
D12
Dirty motherfucking Dozen
Assed you like a snake slut bitch with 30 fucking husbands
Bizarre Kid
Swifty McVay
The Kon Artis
The Kuniva

Haha
And Slim Shady
