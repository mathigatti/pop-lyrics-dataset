Stranded... lost inside myself
My own worst friend
And my own closest enemy


I'm branded... Maladjusted
Never trusted anyone
Let alone myself

I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Elected the rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot

No meaning... And no healing
Self loathing freak and introverted
Deviot

I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Stranded... lost inside myself
My own worst friend
And my own closest enemy

Elected the rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot

I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

I'm getting pissed
I'm a worthless pessimist
I'm a loner in a claustrophobic mind
