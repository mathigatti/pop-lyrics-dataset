Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yo, yo


Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans exploding
Tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one, give'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening

Leave 'em with a taste of sour as vinegar in their mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry, mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time)
I said I'm sorry, mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD

I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
Cos' he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fucking wished he would die

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her, at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today!

What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
Cos' I'da killed them, shit, I would shot Kim and them both
This my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to "The Eminem Show"

I'm sorry, mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time)
I said I'm sorry, mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never dis my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to invision
Witnessin' yo mama poppin' perscription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin' that someones always goin' through her purse and shit missin'
Goin' through public housing system, vitcim of Munchausen's sydrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
Til I grew up, now I blew up, It makes you sick to your stomach
Doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
Well guess what your getting older now and Its cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna know that your phony

And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do ya song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what? I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry, mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning' out my closet
(One more time)
I said I'm sorry, mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning' out my closet
