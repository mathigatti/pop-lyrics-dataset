Aye Boo Get These Motherfuckers
And Pass That Jack


[Hook: Gangsta Boo]
I see you bitches talkin' loud
But you ain't sayin' shit
Get the fuck from round' here
You don't rep my shit
You ain't from my city
You don't know bout' this
You want that drama
You ain't ready for it bitch!

Throw it up! (Yeah Ho) Throw it Up!
Throw It up! (Yeah Ho) You ain't ready for it bitch
Throw It up! (Yeah Ho) Throw It up!
Throw It up! (Yeah Ho) You ain't ready for it bitch

[Verse1: Yelawolf]

I already got..
2 cars in the yard that don't run, so why would I wanna break shit down for you?
Better me confuse with the punchlines and bars that I launch
Here the king of archery come, with a cracker dick..
To fuck you in that pussy carpet you munch
If I'm not hardly the one, you must be barely the one
Barely then really you kidding, bitch I'm the prodical son
And I'm smoking like my daddy, d-dr-d-drinkin' like my mama
C-C-country like my uncles, stutterin' like a CD in a trunk
BUMP, BUMP, BUMP, BUMP
And I'm in a blue Chevy.. runnin' over motherfuckers in first
I ain't even shift gears yet, I ain't even here yet, I'm outta this Earth
Right? (Yeah ho!) Better just hit the surface
And I'm 'bout to walk into a bank with a shank and a black can of paint to check the clerk
(where the keys?) Bitch you better take your purse! I got a brick of herb
And a hit to serve, and I'm feeling like I might just hit the curb
So get the fuck outta my way buddy you don't wanna walk around the chicken house
With a heart of a puppy dog with Yelawolf and Eminem, shit..
Sufferin' succotash, yeah suck a dick, bitch

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]

You'll make me hurt one of your feelings (HAHAHAHA)
Nanananana Pick your face up off the floor
I got you feelin' sad now
You be on that Hokey Wag
Hokey Wag is bullshit
Run into this Gangsta, have your preacher at pull pit, bitch
I was born on the Mississippi Riva'
Take no shit from a bitch or a nigga
So so crazy gotta fucked up temper

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Me and Yelawolf, tear the roof, off this motherfucker
You ain't got the umph, you're a hoof, to the foot of an elephant
Hello tuts, you look so eloquent, that's what I tell a cunt
Come sit up front cause you're kickin' my seat and I'm trying to the tell the cashier what I want!
They say I act like an asshole, when I pull up at the White Castle
And I ask for an application, throw it back in her face an'
Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her in the head with a Whopper
That I bought from BK, you expect me to be proper?
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately, SLUT, HO
Skidda dee da da. Prada? Nadda
Chance I was thinkin' about buying you some clothes
But Target was closed so I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart
But the doors was locked, what about some shoes I thought
Great I suppose, so I go to Payless but what'dya know
They don't carry a size 8 in HOES! ... Oh!
This is ugly boy swag (yeah), puttin' toe tags
On you motherfucking ho bags, what a trailer trash pioneer
I am here, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarreah!
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thing or two
'Bout sign language, middle fingers aimed at you so we don't gotta SCREAM AT YOU!
Ow! I just bit my bottom lip, it was an accident
I went to go tell 'em all to go get BUCKED
But I'm not gonna bite my tongue, little bitch throw it up

I see you bitches talkin' loud
But you ain't sayin'...
