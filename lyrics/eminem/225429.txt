[Bizarre]
Yeah

DJ Green Lantern
D-12, we ain't goin' nowhere
We still smokin' crack nigga
Let 'em know, aha!


CHORUS [Eminem]
Bitch keep talkin'
Keep on poppin' off with them jaws because
we ain't stoppin'
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
so all y'all can lick the balls and keep walkin'
Keep on poppin' that shit you poppin'
'cause we ain't stoppin' 'cause
you ain't stoppin' us
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
so all y'all can lick the balls and keep walkin'
Come on!

[Kuniva]
Yo the derelict's back
I'm blazin' niggas while they up in the Sheraton last
I even sold my therapist crack
You niggas is bitch straight up I'm bearin' the facts
I love pussy wit' all my heart but I married the gat
And nigga I'm top pedigree so don't play wit' me
I'll blow your tattoos all over your baby seat
Kids and all be hit
Peers and all masuberg'll take your back, liver ribs and all
The Kuniva the street talker
Heat sparker the beef starter
Packin' guns when I'm sleep walkin' (Bitch keep talkin')
Throwin' fire bombs down your chimney
While you eatin' at Wendy's
I'm in your bushes cockin' the semi
Nice wit' the hand
Never bow down to another man
I was poppin' guns while you was still poppin' some rubber bands
Smother your clan
Sever your hands and your legs
and mail your brother your heart and send your mother ya head

[Swifty]
I'm the only one your bitch let touch her
Type of brother that will fuck your mother
with a fishnet rubber
A belligerent and rowdy motherfucker
that'll dump your body and still fly away to maui on the ???
When it comes to beefin'
it ain't no explainin'
I'll change your language wit' a stainless
I'm contained wit' a anguish to leave you famous
I'm a deranged pit y'all lift an AK to pinch ya face wit'
Niggas don't say shit
Fuck your hype man
if it's a bystander standin' by I'm firein' at ya, 'cause I can
You get squashed like pop cans
I be shootin' 7Up in your mouth man (Ha!)
I'm about to sell your mama bud, and lace it
So when she fire it up she coughin' blood
I love to see um wasted
I'm made to behave in this case
You try to be brave in this rage and your legs will be replaced

Chorus

[Bizarre]
I ain't her to talk about Benzino or Ja Rule
I'm here to talk about lil' Ray Ray and whatever do
Psyche I ain't gonna mention it
He probably sue
Next week this shit'll be out on DJ Clue (Exclusive!)
The first time I had sex, a dirty mattress
no condom, my grandmother, bent over backwards
Bizarre been fuckin' raw all summer
Let's make a trade, my wife for your brother
Psyche, I'm not bisexual
I'm an intellectual, transsexual, one testicle (one nut)
And I ain't sayin' shit 'cause it rhyme
I got colon cancer, I'm diein' (Yay, yay)

[Proof]
Rest in peace Jam Master Jay
Tupac, and Notorious BIG (come on)
I'm probably the best guy in the flesh
blow ya heart out ya chest
and ya chest out ya vest
Leave ya body a mess streets bloody as hell
study my trail I cut and me fail
A druggy on bail nutty as well
which such like buddy revel dead or in jail still headin' for hell
The ghetto rebels the wrong guy
Get ya lungs heart you full of wholes like Sponge Bob
We can set this from your front door to your CEO office
Got the key to your coffin (So bitch keep talkin') 
Greet me wit' offers we taken over
or get China white mixed wit' bakin' soda, ya hear me?

[Eminem]
GET CRACKED!
You fuckin' crackheads
And this is just mixtape shit you fuckin' morons
This ain't brains over braun
This is bullies over fuckin' pussies
Haha, come on..

Chorus
