[Stat Quo]
Yeah, YEAH!
Stat Quo (Stat Quo) Doc Dre (Doc Dre)
I represent the A-Town, A-Town
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I'm comin' from the A-Town, A-Town
Ha ha, Shady Aftermath


Yeah, once again it's on
Young Statlanta live in this muh'fucker holmes
The hoes get naked soon as the song come on
The niggaz get reckless, it's off the chain here gone
It's poppin' speakers knockin' crowded off on the flo'
They jockin' it, watchin' when I walks through the do'
It's him, tell a friend but you already know
Act stupid or lose it, don't bother to fuck with Quo
I'm kind of different, he's not the usual
Sippin' Cognac in between two beautiful
bitches in the club, talk shit it's your funeral
I came to get a buzz and crunk, understand?
It's crowded, it's packed, it's jumpin', goddamn it's swole
I'm cooler than cool as my temperature's 30 below
I'm checkin' the scene if a new cut, droppin' the low
Shakin' they ass, backin it up, fast or slow (YEA!)

CHORUS
You know this thang don't stop 'til I say so
Now get low, get low, keep that ass on the flo'
You know this club don't close 'til I say so
Now get low, get low, keep that ass on the flo'
Yeah, now get low, get low, keep that ass on the flo'
Get low, get low, keep that ass on the flo'
Yeah, now get low, get low, keep that ass on the flo'
Now get low, get low, keep that ass on the flo'

Yeah, it's goes three two one, shawty that's what's up
At the bar lookin' sober but I'm high as fuck
And as far as all y'all who be actin' tough
I'm in the spot with the glock, please believe it's tucked (woo)
We ready, we sweaty, it's hot, it's off the chain
We mackin', excuse me miss, tell me what's your name
The way you move in them jeans make me happy you came
I'm tryin to get to know you, possibly get some brain
I may pick your brains, I'm the man of your dreams
You like me you wanna be wifey and join my team
So I can sport you and support you by any means
Nah, I ain't givin' you none of my thangs
But we can leave the club tonight, hit the telly and fuck
Long as you know when I bust - I'm in the dust
Ain't no chillin', it ain't nothin' for us to discuss
Except what time your ride pickin' you up (YEAH!)

Chorus

Yeah, yeah
Turn that ass around, go on and do somethin'
Do somethin' girl, touch the ground (YEAH!)
Turn that ass around, go on and do somethin' (c'mon)
Do somethin' girl, touch the ground (OKAY!)
Now drop it drop it drop it, get low, yeah (yea)
Drop it drop it drop it, get low, yeah (YEAH!)
Drop it drop it drop it, get low, yeah
Drop it drop it drop it, get low, yeah (YEAH!)

(Re-Up style)

[Eminem] It's "The Re-Up"!

(This, is...)
