Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it gifted
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy, yeah, you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must've missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club


You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye, aye
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack corn and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye, aye 

I can still remember (what?) tryna shop a deal 
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time'd tell (what?) if I'd prevail (huh?)
And all I did was (what?) put nine inch nails (where?)
In my eyelids, now (what?) I'm seein' diamond sales
Like I'm in Zales (yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means, if rap was skinny jeans
I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no if, and or butts are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fucking with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye, aye
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack corn and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye, aye

Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king, bring me 50 bottles
Tonight we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up is so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye, aye
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack corn and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye, aye (hey, hey, hey)
