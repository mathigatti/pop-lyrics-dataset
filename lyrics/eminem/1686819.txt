Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone they're just memories
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone


Eminem:
Alright
Let's pretend, marshall mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend, things woulda been no different
Pretend he procrastinated and had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
Marshall you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win
Pretend he'd just stay outside all day
And play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools werent changing again
He wasn't socially akward and just strange as a kid

He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums
And just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
You won't amount to shit, quit day dreaming, kid
You need to get your cranium checked
You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic
Now pretend things just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed
And his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it to the rap olympics
Left to his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Hailey and Lainey
These food stamps and this weak shit
Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall on his lap so he ain't even here
He pretends that...

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
