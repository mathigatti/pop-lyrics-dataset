[Intro]
Ohh... It's music to my ears.. Oh man, How can i describe the way i feel.. 
It's fuckin' great man... Ok, let me see... How can I begin...


[Verse 1]
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine, and captain crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up an inbetween snack, *******s to munch
Mariah, whatever happen to us, why did we have to break up
All i asked for was a glass of punch
You see i never really asked for much
I can't imagine whats, going through your mind after such
A nasty break up with that latin' hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back you punk
This is hello kitty bedspread satin funk
Mixed with egyptian with a little rap and punk
Zaf and Eric Clapton shaft brings abba crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean I really want ya bad, you cunt
Nick you had your fun
I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vanacular for dracula acupuncture

[Chorus] 
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease for pete's sake he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time when I rhyme, I'm blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause I'm gone blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a gladbag

[Verse 2]
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the miracle whip and trickster, my signature sound
When the tube of lipsticks around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow, man
What an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma-
cutecals, this beautiful pill dust in my palm-a
cuticle's get residue just from touching the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama
I cut you like Darma, pull a butchers knife on ya
The size of a sword boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowin' ya Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', Drop the shovel boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucka born
Snuck up on malakai and made the motherfuckers suck on a shucka corn
Shucka, Shucka corn, shucka corn, hit Jason in the face with a hockey puc
And told him it's fuckin' on, now what the fuck are ya doin'
You're runnin' over the snow blower with the lawn mower
Blowing your Bagpipes From Baghdad

[Chorus] 
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease for pete's sake he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time when I rhyme, I'm blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause I'm gone blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a gladbag

[Verse 3] 
In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become hetro-sexual
Nothing will stop me from molesting you
Titty fucking you 'till your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicle
Is what they said, to the two conjoined twins
Hows it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?
You need some ointment, just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip
I just got my one year soriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby you should have any trouble rubbing groins with
Eachother, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get a needle and thread from the sowing kit
And attempt to seperate them, and stitch them back at the loins, shit
knew thelittle boy with the choclate chips ahoy chip
cookie looky, even took me a polaroid quick

[Chorus] 
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease for pete's sake he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time when I rhyme, I'm blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause I'm gone blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a gladbag
