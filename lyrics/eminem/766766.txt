Up front
Akon
Slim Shady
I see the one
'cause she be that lady


I feel you creepin', I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend ya over
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oooh

Up front style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot store with the lack down
konvicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe in tact now
I feel it, go on and crack now
All I see is all that back now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

I feel you creepin', I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend ya over
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oooh

[Eminem]
Ohh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on
when I throw this thang on
Get a little drink on
They gon' flip
for this Akon shit
You can bank on it
Pedicure, Manicure, Kitty Cat Claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty Cat Dolls
Tryna hold my woody back, through my drawers
Steps off the stage, didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me and she's like 'Youu'rre!'
I'm like, 'Yeah I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
or more like a palace shall I say
And plus I got a pal, every gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing! AKON!!
