This I Promise You...  (remake of westlife's.)When the visions around you
Bring tears to your dopey eyes
And all that surround you
Are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength
I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should text message
Was standing here all alongAnd I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
'Til the day my life is through
This I promise you
										   I've loved you forever
In lifetimes before
And I promise you never
Will you hurt anymore
I give you my word
I give you my heart
This is a battle we've won
And with this  vowForever has now begun
Just close your eyes
Each lovin' day
And know this feeling won't go away
'Til the day my life is through
This I promise youOver and over I fall
When I hear you message
Without you in my life, dopey
I just wouldn't be living at all
This I promise youâ€¦I'm NOT playing lady, you know I Love You. mwaaaa
