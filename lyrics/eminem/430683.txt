Whhoooaaaaaaahhhhh

All these dreams
And all these plans
I built them all with these two hands
Everything, I've realized my dreams


The city lights shine down
And they blind me sometimes
But through it all
I was lost but I've found my way


So tell me what you want
Cause I will give you anything
Tell me what you need and I'll go get it
I'd give up all these dreams
To have you in my arms right now
I'd give up everything and I'd forget it

I wasn't on a mountain
When it came to me

All my life's been wasted
Chasing shallow dreams
So here we are
Let me lift you up and show you this world
Over me

And all these things
That I've gained
And what I've seen
