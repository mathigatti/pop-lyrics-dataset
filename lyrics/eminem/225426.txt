Yo, testing
This thing back on again
That's perfect, God damn good
Yo, this is Rondell Beene
I'm back on the motherfuckin' scene
and I'm upset as a motherfucker
I mean first I didn't get paid for the D12 shit
You heard me rippin' on there, they just edited my verse out
Then I was on Obie's shit, I was in Obie's video
and that Obie go ahead and I didn't get paid for that shit
And now they got this bald head weed smokin' motherfucker
and his name is...


[Young Zee]
Young Zee, keep movin' for the macs, be cubin'
Hmm? I'll make you sing like big Ruben
Man in the hood, I'm the American Idol
First I'll fight you, and then run up on your stairs with a rifle, bang
Tech claims make you wipe out like X-Games
Next sprain's in your motherfuckin' leg bang?
Tryin' to shoot me like they tryin' to shoot 50
Either you gon' die or need a new kidney
Till I drop, I'ma sell to your friends
Till I get some of that tin, in the federal pin
I spit better than them niggas wanna fight me
better go get in the gym or the metal'll spin
Since smokes' in 'Nam
doin' drugs than Eminem moms
Ten times, Dirty Dozen, all x times
Bash your ride, crash when you drive
flip your dumbass out the passenger side
Uhh {*car crash*}
