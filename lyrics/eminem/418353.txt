Wooahhhhhhhh!
It's Shady, a.k.a. the army Shady Records
Break it down
I do a lot of spittin'
and I don't gotta try
But I ain't got rhymes to waste
So let's make 'em


I ain't say I'm a gangsta
I ain't got to start frontin'
I just get Banks up
when I need to pop somethin'

I got a friend of mine
named 50 Cent I signed
This shit's official now
the deal is finished and it's time
to get down to this business
Let's gon' get these nicks and dimes
So hurry up and cop G-Unit shit before it's gone
It's like a gold mine
for my man to take nine
And bounce right back, gotta be like Michael Myers
This shit must me a sign
These labels must be blind
Columbia I know this must be fuckin' with they mind
They know they 'bout to cry
'cause they missed out but I
know how to get the dope 'cause Dre gave me a business mind
I say 'em a line
I hit 'em with a 9
I had a empty clip but they ain't check the chamber (Ha!)

CHORUS
I ain't no gangsta
I ain't got to start frontin'
I just call Banks up
when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit
You gon' hit the stop button
We gon' fuck you up a long time
You gon' get stomped stuntin'

Chorus
Damn 50
this shit's about to hit the fan 50
The fuck happened to Ja
He got the sickest vendetta
He must think that you wetta
He bought to play with his paper
You gonna fuck with this chedda
Now homie think we gonna sweat 'em
but we just gonna forget 'em
If he don't shut up we'll get 'em
Let Yayo stomp his head and it's all good
'cause we'd rather rap in the letter
pussy play us outta pocket homie
so tell 'em he better be easy
Start some bullshit he'll get his whole crew wet
D-twizzy, Obie, 50 Cent, and G-Unit
Yo he don't want it 'cause
he's always drugged out
You won't see no picture where his pupils ain't bugged out

Chorus
