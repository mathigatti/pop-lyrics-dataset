Deep in nighttime's guard
Between shadows
They are hiding shapes to me
Keeping an eye deep in my mind


I can see their faces
Flying into starlight

Black birds are carrying
My soul back home to north
There's no turn around
No, 'cause I belong to north!

Fading in between
Day and nighttime
They are finding my way
Always behind deep in my mind

Black birds are carrying
My soul back home to north
There's no turn around
No, 'cause I belong to north!

Take me back to the northern lands
Where I belong!
Fly me back to northern lands
Take me home!

Lakes and woods
Endless like summer sun
Leaving me here
Black birds disappear

Black birds are carrying
Our souls back home to north
There's no turn around
No, 'cause I belong to north!

Where I belong! Oh
Take me home! Where I belong!
