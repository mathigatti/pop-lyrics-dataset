(Chorus) 
I tell myself that I was doin' all right 
There's nothin' left to do tonight 
But go crazy on you 
Crazy on you 
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohhh 


Can't you see what you do to me baby, 
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac 
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick 
You're truly the only one who can do this to me 
You just make me get so crazy 
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic 
One minute I wanna slit your throat the next I wanna sex 
You make me crazy 
The way we act like two maniacs in the sack 
We fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit 
Cause the next day we right back at it 
In the same exact pattern 
What the fuck is the matter with us 
We can't figure out if it's lust 
Or if it's love which that is attractin us to eachother 
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother 
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin bitch 
But I stay and still stick it out with you 
Even though I just hit you today but you deserved it 
You hit me first and provoked me to choke you 
Just cause I came home late last night 
Crawled in bed and I woke you 
But if there's one thing about you that I admire 
It's baby, because you stay with me 
Maybe cause you're as crazy as I am 
Cause when I look at you 
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside 
I see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise 
You're always full of surprises 
Always pullin devices out your personal vibrators and dildos 
You've fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore 
You're only 24 but you're plenty more mature 
Then those other little ho's who just act like little girls 
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool 
Chillin' you play your position you never step out of line 
Even though I stay in your buisness 
You've always kept out of mine 
I wonder what's on your mind 
Sometimes they say love is blind 
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye 
You ain't see the sign 
Or maybe you did maybe you like me in charge 
baby cause we're crazy in love.... 

(Chorus) 

I go crazy on you 
Crazy on you 
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohhh 

You are the ink to my paper 
What my pen is to my pad 
The moral, the very fiber 
The whole substance to my rap 
You are my reason for being 
The meaning of my existance 
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this 
As intense as I do, and the irony 
Is you rely on me as much 
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do 
You provide me the lighter fluid to fuel in my fire 
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter 
The only way that I'm able to stay so stable 
Is you're the legs to my table, 
If you were to break I'd fall on my face 
But I'm always gonna make you feel 
I don't need you as much as I really need you 
So you don't use it to your advantage 
But you're essential to me 
You're the air I breathe 
I believe if you ever leave me 
I'd probaly have no reason to be 
You are the Kim to my Marshall 
You're the Slim to my Shady 
The Dre to my Eminem 
The Alaina to my Hailie 
You are the word that I'm lookin for 
When I'm tryin to describe how I feel inside 
And the right one just won't come to my mind 
You're like the pillow that props me up 
The beam that supports me 
The bitch who never took half 
The wife who never divorced me 
You're like the root to my evil 
You let my devil come out me 
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me 
And no matter how much too much is never enough 
Baby cause we're crazy in love... 

(Chorus) 

I go crazy on you 
Crazy on you 
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohhh
