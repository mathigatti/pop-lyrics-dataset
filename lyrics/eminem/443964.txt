And I give up forever to touch you
Cuz I know that you feel me somehow
Your the closest to heaven that all ever be
And I dont want to go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you right now


And I dont want the world to see me
Cuz I dont think that theyd understand
When everythings mesnt to be broken
I just want to know who I am

And you can fight the tears that aint coming
Or the moment of truth in you lies
When eveything feels like the movies
Yeah you pleed just to know your alive

And I dont want the world to see me
Cuz I dont think that theyd understand
When everythings meant to be broken
I just want to know who I am

And I dont want the world to see me
Cuz I dont think that theyd understand
When everythings meant to be broken
I just want to know who I am

And I dont want the world to see me
Cuz I dont think that theyd understand
When everythings meant to be broken
I just want to know who I am
I just want to know who I am
I just want to know who I am
I just want to know who I am
