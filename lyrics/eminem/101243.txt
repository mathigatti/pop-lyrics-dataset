Hahahaha...
Aiyo 50
What I tell you?
We ain't even have to say shit, they did it
Haha!


Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move
Just let 'em come to you
'cause they always gon' seem to do
what the other one do
So let him come to you
the rest will just follow suit
Monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum
If they really want it bad enough well then they gon' come
Now here they come like we expected
Now we just set them up
Check mate motherfucker, games over we won
Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum

Doesn't take much for me to raise such a stake up
When motherfuckers hate your guts 
You ain't even gotta say much
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
it's like smearing' blood stains with a paint brush
I can't explain what it is my brain does
But however it works it's insane, it's plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain is dangerous
It's a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
And I'm not afraid to raise the stakes up 
I got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
But anybody who gets on a track and spanks us 
I'm patiently waiting for the day, I'm anxious
To see the look on your fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
You're drunk, you ain't tough
Whatever you drank must've just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talkin' motherfucker, this ain't drugs
You wanna pop shit, wake up then make up
Fuck that! It's too late chump now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits
with the caliber that Nas and Jay does
Open up his jaw to say somethin' to rattle my name off
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fuckin' dust off of this chainsaw
Give 'em the surgery that he came for till I peel the pain off
I never been shot
but I think me and 50 must've been cut from the same cloth
'cause I've always came off like Ja's chain
when they tried to rush him in large
They came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don't stop, only thing that I wait for is the day
That I ain't gotta report to probate court
'cause I'ma give you all the reason to hate more 
'cause I've been holdin' my tongue 'till I gotta sprained jaw
A lot of rappers on my list that just ain't Ja
And I'ma read that motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft 'cause 8 Mile
When I come back I'ma be shootin' more than just paint balls, trust me=/font&gt;

Fuckin' dummies
This ain't chess, you playin' motherfuckin' checkers
This shit is all day man, it's too easy
We playin' chess, you playin' checkers
You 'bout to get your motherfuckin' asses jumped, fuckin' punks
Aod by the way, we ain't just talkin' to one person
We're talkin' to every motherfuckin' body who wants to bring it
'cause we bringin' it to anybody who wants to bring it, so bring it
Don't pick up the ball if you don't wanna play man
It's all fucked up now
FUCK I'M SPOSED TO DO NOW? HUH
THE FUCK I'M SPOSEE TO DO?!
Haha
Yo we out
