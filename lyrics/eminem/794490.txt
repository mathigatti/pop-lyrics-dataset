Like I got something for you 
And the way that you stare 
Don't you dare 
'Cause I'm not about to 
Just give it on up to you 
'Cause there are some things I won't do 
And I'm not afraid to tell you 
I don't ever want to leave you confused 


The more you try 
The less I buy it 
And I don't have to think it through 
You know if I'm into you 

I don't need a man to make it happen 
I get off being free 
I don't need a man to make me feel good 
I get off doing my thing 
I don't need a ring around my finger 
To make me feel complete 
So let me break it down 
I can get off when you ain't around 
Oh! 

You know I got my own life 
And I bought everything that's in it 
So if you want to be with me 
It ain't all about the bling you bringing 
I want a love that's for real 
And without that then no deal 
And baby I don't need a hand 
If it only wants to grab one thing 

The more you try 
The less I buy it 
And I don't have to think it through 
You know if I'm feeling you 

I don't need a man to make it happen 
I get off being free 
I don't need a man to make me feel good 
I get off doing my thing 
I don't need a ring around my finger 
To make me feel complete 
So let me break it down 
I can get off when you ain't around 

Let it go 
Let it go 
Let it go 
Let it go 
[Repeat 4X] 

I don't need a 
I don't need a man, I don't 
I don't need a man 
I'll get me through 
'Cause I know I'm fine 
I feel brand new 

I don't need a 
I don't need a man, I don't 
I don't need a man 
I'll make it through 
'Cause I know I'm fine 
Without you! 

I don't need a man to make it happen 
I get off being free 
I don't need a man to make me feel good 
I get off doing my thing 
I don't need a ring around my finger 
To make me feel complete 
So let me break it down 
I can get off when you ain't around 
Oh! 

I don't need a man (I'm over you) 
I don't need a man (I'm over you) 
I don't need a man 
(I'm without you) 
(I'm over you) 

I don't need a man 
I don't need a man 
I don't need a man
