[Eminem]
I want you to understand something
that when I come up in this b-tch I want the fans jumping,
I want the fist pumping in the air,
I don't look like a millionnaire,
but I feel like a million bucks,
ladies wont ya fill your cups,
Shady's come to fill ya up,
if your a D or a C cup
you can even be a B
its just me and DRE
you'll be in the ER we'll be strapped with so much TNT,
we may blow no not even CPR from the EMT
could help you to resuscitate
you busters must be flustered wait
you cant cut the mustard, whats your problem can't you bust a grape,
whats my name, shady came and just crushed the game,
its really not even fair to them,
cos they pale in comparisons
so much they might aswell wear a skin,
dont you just wish you could share his pen
cos this sh-ts getting embarrassing,
the fog is stinking the air is thin,
cos he wont even let them try to breathe,
da da di di da di dee, he makes it look so easy,
girl you just hit the lottery,


[Chorus]
now this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on,
and hell breaks loose,
try to restrain us you cant contain us,
we still gonna make a statement no matter what we do,
everywhere we go it seems were looking for any excuse to just cut loose,
so this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose,

[Dr Dre]
This is when sh-ts hits the fan,
like it just splattered on stan
this is the only moment that matters,
ya homie rolled in with Mathers,
like chaos erupts Em's in back Dre's in the front
so do what we say at once this songs like a Seance, it haunts,

[Eminem]
It makes em stay in a trance
no choice they have to dance,

[Dr Dre]
Its like the play-off just making sure that we stay in the hunt
take a day off of what man you better lay off the blunts
you must be smoking something
you think I aint smoking nothing stay off my nuts,
now hit the floor baby time to wipe away all the rust,
shake all them cobwebs loose,
loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose,
yeah girl shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse,
DRE is on the loose,
A Mongoose when its comes to the chronic use,
you know I can't stand to lose,
me and my goons are like animals,
we come through like a pack of wolves,
so we came here to retract the roof,
yeah man aint that the truth,
girl your man's like in the booth
definitely back up in this b-tch,
this is when all hell breaks loose,

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Now I know your feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words,
A murderer in the flow, liquid courage im finna blow
as soon as we hit the door power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go,
we're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows,
ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block widcha hoe,
with speakers knocking its 3 0 clock
me and Doc then proceed to drop E
and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door,

[Dr Dre]
Yeah so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow,
we aint bluffin for nothing
we'll knock the stuffing out ya
revenge is so sweet, move til ya injure ya feet
yeah move or lose it three,
move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably,
pass some of that (?) lil right there,
that would be pretty stupid to me,
born and raised in the CPT,
yeah Los Angeles who's in the streets,
them haters hating on me,
but I refuse to lose any sleep,
keep that deuce deuce in the seat,
Dre fall off thats news to me,

[Chorus]
[End]
