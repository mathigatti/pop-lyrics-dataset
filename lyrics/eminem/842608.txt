Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat
Am I underground, or am I just a spoiled brat
I drink a litre of tylenol
Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol
Fuckit


Giving it a 110% but luckily I ain't gotta pay the rent
School goes on
Switching your mind thoughts on
English German they're all the same
Gotta do homework everyday but hey
It's ok cuz in your life it clears a way which you can take
Without having to fake a diploma
And end up in a coma
Cuz you couldn't pay the dealerâ€¦nothing can get realer
Cheaper, unless you become a keeper for some ice-hockey team in the NHL
Cuz that will tell you that everything will get well
That you won't need to sell your wife to get away from the knife
I remember when I was younger and funner
But I was no good runner, I could scream like thunder, my neighbour was a hunter
Hunting, blunting, that's a fun thing
yeh really it is

Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat
Shoot your grandma cuz she looks like a cat
I drink a litre of tylenol
Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol
Fuckit

Bling bling, I'm tired of everything
Ding dong I sing a song for this chick wearing a thong
I wanna stay alive, I wanna survive and I wanna perform live
I need time
To heal cuz there's no chance that I will kneel down like a clown and frown
It's time to cheer, not shed a tear but I fear that death is coming near
I can hear it from the rear, I can see it clear
I got support from my friends
But everything tends to send me to court
I lock myself in my fort it's the kinda sort that send me a package of Blends
To my porch lighting a torch to see the world I envy
Everything can be nothing to see this is me

Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat
Shoot your grandma cuz she looks like a cat
I drink a litre of tylenol
Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol
Fuckit

I will tell you about what runs my life
It's the hate, and the rate of thoughts
Living on tequila shots and cuttin myself wit knives
My brain dives into a nothingness
A bottomless hole
Filled with pain and sorrow
No time to borrow a rhyme to make things aight
Cuz it's pointless
Timeless
I'm tired of this
I wanna be famous
And entertainous
All I see is pain
And all I feel is rain
Hitting my overheated brain
This is insane
How can one person make you feel like this
Make you just wanna diss
And give another one a fake kiss
I approve with this wrist
And remove my foolish pulse
That beats for nothing
At least now you'll have something
To think about
This will be the last time you hurt me, cuz I hurt myself
Then I shout
Fall to the ground
Now things will turn around
Will I maybe be happy now
I bow to thee
The mistress of depressed horror
I'm infested, not the least bit interested
In life
This is what will happen now
I will pull out this mag
And aim it toward my head
I will say that you're a fag
Then I'm dead
Will anyone miss me
Or is the world so full with greed
That people try to keep what I twirled

Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat
Am I underground, or am I just a spoiled brat
I drink a litre of tylenol
Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol
Fuckit
Natural Habitat continues until music fades
