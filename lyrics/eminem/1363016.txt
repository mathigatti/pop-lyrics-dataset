Oh
Oh
I said oh
I said oh
I said man
Damn oh dammit please couldn't he back
I am having a relapse


How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail man, what the hell is his problem?
Well to be honest the smell of this chronic, leaves make me hella demonic.
They compelled me to kill this elderly man, and
I get these these panic attacks, pop a Xanax relax!
Tryna' stick my fuckin' dick inside a mannequin's ass.
Then I get manic depressed, see the orthodontist get gas masked
Kick ass, the first thing I put on is the mask.
Speaking of mask, man it ain't too late to have a change of pace,
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you facin'
Slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation.
That's bacon souffl√© you makin' ain't you? But thank you Jason.
There goes one more coma, due to blunt force trauma.
Just give me one more soma, and I'll be done for it mama.
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium lawsuit.
Shove in the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet.
It seems like every day I get a little flakier,
The medication is makin' my hands a little shakier.
Hand me that 18-month-old baby, to shake him up.
It'll only take me a, second to choke his trachea.
Breaking his neck in eightysome places, baby he's Shady comes lady.
He's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chain-ch-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering bumbling mu-mu-mumbling dumb dumbs.
Yea, here I come come, you here the rumbling? Vrum-vrum?
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum-drum.
My head and torso is someone, where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to maybe the girl with the long blonde?
Hair who disappeared and left the cheerleader pom-poms.
Clearly there's somin' wrong, 'cos she didn't come home.
She's missin,' where is she? Somethin' fishy is goin' on!
I guess he stuck the bitch, with the pitchfork, with the long prongs.
Now everybody get your dance on to my dance song,
Come on!
