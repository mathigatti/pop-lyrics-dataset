Yeah
I'm Tryin to catch me sumthin
I'ma catch you sumthin


[Chorus]
Nigga that watch is nice
That's what you bought from me
That chain is nice
That's what you bought from me
Them earrings is nice
That's what you bought from me?
Take that shit off,
Move I'll break you off properly

I get mine the fast way,
Ski mask way
Make money
Make money, money, money
Nigga if you ask me
It's the only way
Take money
Take money, money, money

[Verse 1]
You wanna spray at me? Go head
The last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Ya little sister callin you stupid
Reason why?
Her and ya momma in the livin room now hog-tied
I came up wit two new ways to get rich I cant wait
Got a brand new cig
And that old thirty eight
I be scheming to put a lil' bread on my plate
Watchin Dre serve skunk
Through the hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine
Sell em' back the next day
You thought I really wanted ya pussy
Bitch please
This is stash house, jack pot,
Leave her them keys
My black g-unit hoody just reak of marijuana
Cocaine comin out my pores in the sauna
Im serious man
I'm so sincere
This the flow right here
That f**ked up Jeffery's career
Make money, take money
Yeah nigga yeah

[Chorus]

Nigga that watch is nice
That's what you bought from me
That chain is nice
That's what you bought from me
Them earrings is nice
That's what you bought from me?
Take that shit off,
Move I'll break you off properly

I get mine the fast way, ski mask way
Make money
Make money, money, money
Nigga if you ask me
It's the only way
Take money
Take money, money, money

[Verse 2]

Whos dat peepin in my window
Wow
The feds on me now
They know when im sleepin
They know when im wake
I know they got my phone taped
Im screamin f**k jake
Im tryin to stay out them pens,
So I switched states
Bad news V-A now that sounds great
I see niggas wit that ice on, rims shined up
This towns one big pussy waitin to get f**ked
I holla at A-I peoples to get gats
They charged me 500 a piece for two macs
Then im back doin me
Im back out on a spree
Catch me n' niggas slippin out pumpin dat D
Give me a lil' crew I'll have em' pumpin for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name in N-Y they don't know where I be
Yeah a nigga doin dirt but a nigga low key

[Chorus]

Nigga that watch is nice
That's what you bought from me
That chain is nice
That's what you bought from me
Them earrings is nice
That's what you bought from me?
Take that shit off,
Move I'll break you off properly

I get mine the fast way, ski mask way
Make money
Make money, money, money
Nigga if you ask me
It's the only way
Take money
