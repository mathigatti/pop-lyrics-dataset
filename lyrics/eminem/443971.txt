Can you sleep as the sound hits your ears,
one at a time
An unspoken balance here
Unabridged for so many years 
that I should stare at receivers,
to receive her
Isn't fair


Chorus:
Don't worry
I'll catch you,
Don't worry
I'll catch you,
Don't ever worry

Your arms in mine, anytime
Wouldn't trade anything,
You're still my everything
To my surprise,
Before my eyes,
You've arrived

(Chorus)

Still breaking old habits, habits
You pulled the wool over me,
I can see everything, everything
Remembering,
Just remembering

(Chorus)
No need for reminding,
You're still all that matters to me.....
