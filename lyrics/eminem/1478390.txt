[Eminem]
Good evening
This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of
Four million and a half feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please, undo your seat belt for takeoff
You are now free to smoke about the cabin


[Dr. Dre]
I'm Dre, from back in the day
From N.W.A, from black and the gray
From choking a bitch, to smacking her face
From stacking up bodies, to racking AKs up
From racking up hits, to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry, and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happenin' in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, as far as competition, faggot, there ain't none

[Eminem]
Speak of the Devil, it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

[Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smoking with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smoking with the best)

[Eminem]
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen; say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

[Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smokin' with the best)

[Dr. Dre]
Now where there's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

[Eminem]
Nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, vodka and creatine
Hpnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake

[Dr. Dre]
Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smokin' with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin' shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smokin', you just holdin' shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off of puffing them trees

[Eminem &amp; Dr. Dre]
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up, Cheech
Come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady, man, come on backâ€”What?
Man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
Now look at all the pretty women in here (damn, bitches!)
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just

[Eminem]
Give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smokin' with the best)
