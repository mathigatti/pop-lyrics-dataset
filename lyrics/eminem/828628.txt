[intro- eminem &amp; 50 cent]
Gee wilikers gatman they got me surrounded
I'm on my way


[chorus - 50 cent]
I got a gatman
There's a problem i'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch shady i'll leave you dearly departed
This ain't batman

[verse 1- 50 cent]
Robin, cagney or lacey, it's 50 cent and shady
The worst baby, put your hands on my people
I'll be act crazy, put a hole thru ya front and ya back maybe
But dude if you try me, i'll have ya ass hooked up to an iv
I'll leave no witnesses when i ride b
You fuck with me, you see
I react like an animal,and tear you apart
If the masterpiece was murder, i'd major in art
Niggas knew i wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, land me on top of the charts (whoo)
So you take the good with the bad, i guess
Level three teflon plate on my chest
Hamma cock back hollow tip in the chamber
Danger, anger will change ya
And make ya aim there and squeeze

[chorus 50 cent]
I got a gat man
There's a problem i'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a batman

[verse 2- eminem]
Mothafucka, you retarded you touch 50
I'll leave you dearly departed
We're walkin' away from a beef, in which clearly you started
I said we're walkin' away, did you hear me you outa be thankful
That we ain't beefin' was to agree and just leave it at that
Thats when me, 50, and g-unit hop back in that bat mobile
It ain't gonna be no more rappin', it's gonna be rrrrllllat
Retaliation will be like that muslim shit attack
Some where along the line, its like me and 50 made a pact
He's got my back, i got his back
It's almost like we're kinda like siamese twins
Cause when we beef we pull each other in
To the bullshit like we're conjoined at the hip
Its just unavoidable some of this shit is squashable
And some shit will never boil up
And some of it will just simmer at best
If left alone, we'll let it be so there won't be no sit downs
With daves and zinos, there will no peace discussions with me
There ain't gon' be no friendly debates over competency
Just quit fuckin' with me and i'll gladly quit fuckin' with you
Just spit ya sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentionin' me, the machine or jimmy iovine and dre or 50
D-twizzie, obie and just let it be or we'll be back with a

[chorus - 50 cent]
Gatman
There's a problem i'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a batman
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch shady i'll leave you dearly departed

[verse 3 - 50 cent]
Nigga you get it twisted, you can get ya wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, i don't care if police know i did it
Man i hustle, i get money, in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie i just gotta get it
Got money scheme you plot and you count me in i'm with it
You cross me and you gon' make a cemetary visit
That's gangsta, you know me i told it, cuz i live it
Showcases drop, when that chopper chop
Way up the block, get hit with copper tops
When drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops
This aint new, niggas know how i be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you i want it
Its not a game, perfect aim you feel the flame
Up against ya brain, man its so hot i'll make ya wish it rained

[chorus - 50 cent]
I got a gat man
There's a problem i'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch shady i'll leave you dearly departed
