[Chorus: Eminem]
Yall better leave dat boy alone
Cuz if they dont
You know they goin come back on 'em
And they dont want him to come back strong
I wouldnt durr get that boy goin
I said leave dat boy alone
Cuz yall dont know him
That there boy he out cold
And that there boy he been known 
To stirr some shit up when he in that zone


[Bridge x2]
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Cuz you dont want to get that boy goin

[Verse 1: Swift]
It's my attitude that's makin me bust shit
I hate to be fucked with
So basically niggas wastin they time tryin to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Returnin bows 'fore you be lookin at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
Witha mag and i'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation i run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her mouth to gun ressecitation
A niggas information, they hunted and they sad
Got you mad cuz they shittin through their stomach in a bag
We comin too strong so its irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancin
Comin here is the worste mistake that could ever happen
When i'm in my vehicle i'm pullin you in
I gaurantee the world will never see you again

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kon Artist]
Honest to god i usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain somethin to ya
A real street nigga aint tryin to get in the streets
He's tryin to get out, feel me?
And he aint the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb hoe punk
Atleast a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
This nigger dyin over prizes to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, i dont play deep
You borrow guns, i own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's wrong that you hoes thinkin you can't really get sleep
Cuz you laid a nigga down without any meat
Well my cops wont allow me to make decisions in vein 
I'm a magne i do my biddin and i do it again
If you take it to that level, i take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Now people i live triflin i express it through writin
If you can't feel it, then i must express it through fightin
And i jus bought me a new gauge and added on a knew knife
And i strike peopel so fast people think i threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few height men
Been harassed by two dykes who wanted (?lou pikner)
Plus you know i'm too violent, to be out with you whilin
Cuz as soon as you drivin im a spit a few 5 ones
And i love to Kunive son, and you left a live one
I know how to hide guns, skinny or wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You lookin for hoes, and up in here you goin find none
You niggas get dropped once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stuck till your eyes shut
No time for the wild ones, i'm writin these five words
FUCK YOU DICK RIDIN NIGGAS count it, it's five words.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Sifty McVeigh (that boy he hot to death)
Mr. Porter (that boy he hot to death)
Kuniva (that boy he hot to death)
Yep, better step before you get beat to death
Yall dont want to be dem there boys
Dem there boys be makin noise
Dem there boys got all kind of toys
You better step before you get destroyed
D12
Dem there boys are hot to death
