[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Make some noise
Aw shit
Yeah
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what
Alright
Well I brought some friends with me too


[Verse 1 - Eminem]
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax light a couple wax candles then black out
And relapse till I yack Jack Daniels and yap
Burp bubbles, attitudes immaturing
Double shot of bacardi, party
Vision is blurring, woh ho
I can't see shit
My words get to slurring uh oh
You can call me R Kelly now or you're in trouble
What's incurring before after enduring the show
Has no baring on the bad news I'm baring whoa
what is it word play?
No I'm pushing you out the dumps
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fucking feet till you get to squishing a hoe
It's pandemo-nium standin' oh when you see him oh
Damn baby you look good you're giving me wood
You should pull over like a sweat shirt with a hood
Snap work a napoleon you and me both
Break bread while I'm coppin' over this game now pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me
I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash
Like I stepped on the gas destroyed the front end
Deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident
And bit a goddamn jaw-breaker in half
So stop taping the funk and start shaking ya ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the caucasian the rap
Just Blaze on the track
What the f-ck is more amazing than that slut
Answer me that, Royce where you at?

[Verse 2 - Royce D' 5'9"]
I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers
Are prying you apart tune-up on your head designed by a bar-stool
Designed by a cartoon, before I need to be hired
Jimmy 'IO fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down
Like ya'll are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house n-gga
F-ck your couch n-gga
You screaming f-ck the world with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My b-tch, know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel the OJ the Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear
Then ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, evil, weirdo, Alfred Ego, mad cerebral, you on your last burrito
(What that mean Nickel?)
It's a rap if you eating, get a beat then terrorize that b-tch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touchin' that
Good day and good night, Ortiz where the fuck you at?

[Verse 3 - Joel Ortiz]
I'm right here my Nike Airs buzz light-years ahead of my mic peers
Quite scary to look at, a nightmare, where my book at I'll write fear
In the heart of you tight squares, I harbor the art of you night square
It's tight ware 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his 9th beer
Homie chill listen, I swear, I'm God, I give tracks a holy feel
And they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be, just waiting to be hooked to IVs
Monroe's brown when you look at my pee
And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction, and record the pig's oink
When I rip his intestines
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arouse after they did an inspection
What I exhibit, seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shit I did it again, when I lit with this pen, I admitted this phlegm
This time along side Em and the Em
So tell a friend to tell a friend, write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the f-ck is Crook?

[Verse 4 - Crooked I]
I'm right here letting the shotty pop
Quick as a karate chop, get your body shot, get your top chopped like a lollipop
Come with Maserati drop in the body shot
Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the 9th inning
A knife in a gunfight I love it me and my knife winnin'
I laugh when you fall the shit will be funny
I buy my bitch a new a-s and watch her sit on my money
Man all the bitches holla, they wanna drop my bridges than jaw my dick and swallow
Leave drawers in this Impala, I ball like Iguidala,
I bear more arms than 6 koalas
As soon as a I draw get sent to Alaba
I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun, I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, And genius gun, a syllable gun
Real as they come, Long Beach Sadan
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu
As I fly we do what you try to do without trying
'Cause to us it's so easy, where, jump-off Joe Beezy
