CHORUS [Lloyd Banks]
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth I don't care
but if you get too close I'm gon' clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gon' do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
it ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day 


[Obie Trice]
Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna loot
Like you mo'fuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'ma stand here as a man
and let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy nigga's vibes
Everybody running for their motherfuckin' lives
Tough club niggas, we leave early
Cock back surely
Open up your fade
Your grey brain meets motor city pave
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay-Z
O's an amimal, skirt's get mirked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
Trust in God, 'cause you's about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from who you be wit'
Keep this a secret, right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck

Chorus 

[Lloyd Banks]
But as long as I'm here I'm gon' grab checks
and make my cash stretch longer than giraff necks
Poverty'll make your ass bet, on words
Touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish their last sents'
They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
if that's the case then get a bigger one
You don't think I pack the pump
'cause I'm out of the hood
That's a stereotype, like everybody that's black and junk
I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
Got rings like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them
Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavash, I'm established, so the cabbager come
I'm in the clouds you don't see me on a train
I travel first class you ain't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name
'cause I ain't goin' back and forth
Your boss and your captain's soft

Chorus 

[Eminem]
'Cause we gon' bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? You gonna get it
Man we gon' hit 'em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out {*spit*}
Too much venom and if you role with 'em
we gon' fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum movin' in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em (BOOM)
You know how we do it, when we do, how we do it, when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assasins
Ski masks and gloves consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizast
Fuck your litte bitch ass up
We are not killers, my vato will have you shot though
dragged through the barrio on fuck, like Kim Osario
Litte sorry hoe ass, go ask B-Real
We burn Source covers like fuckin' Cypress Hill did in the 90's
when you was in diapers still
Shady Records you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, I don't smoke
but I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin P.O. choke
I'm an OG, you're fuckin' with a GI Joe
Bia Bia, mia meo a vida loco
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spittin' baby food on people
A tent sieged on her ranch, huddled up next to her
with Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cat pealed back or your shit pushed in?
I put my blade in your like a fuckin' pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Henn dogg
I'll show you how to kill a fuckin' man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco essay?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Sha...dy and the "d" is for these nuts
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months
I'm having an E party for easter please come, 'cause we gon'

[50 Cent]
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? You gonna get it
Man we gon' hit 'em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out {*spit*}
Too much venom and if you role with 'em
we gon' fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a 12 gauge mossbert to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for breath after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God 'cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around, you know how I get down
I watch gansta flicks and root for the bad guy
Turn it off before it end 'cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fending to touch somethin'
When I raise my knife shit I'm fending to cut somethin'
See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me
(Haha sorry Kim)
[Eminem] (Haha oh sorry ohhh)

Chorus 

[Eminem] Souls Assasins y'all
What up Muggs?
[DJ Muggs] What up Em?
[Eminem] We outta here
