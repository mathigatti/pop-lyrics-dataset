Waitin', watchin' the clock, it's four o'clock, it's got to stop
Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech
As he opens the door, she rolls over..
pretends to sleep as he looks her over..


She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man.
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man.
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Ohh...

Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know; she tells herself..
Oh...
Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to come along...
Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone
She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man...
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man...
She lies and says she still loves him, can't find a better man...
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man...
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Yeah...

She loved him, yeah...she don't want to leave this way
She needs him, yeah...that's why she'll be back again
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better... man...
