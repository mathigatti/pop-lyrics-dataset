Eminem- 
Good morning
Haha
Wake ur mother fuckin asses up
yo with us or what
Good morning
Haha
Wake ur mother fuckin asses up
Wake ur mother fuckin asses up
Wake ur mother fuckin asses up
Yo wit us or what
Well come on then u know what time it is
Stop sleepin on my roof bitch
For whatever its worth, it's worth havin my ass whipped
Cause I'm a have the last lift that had ever kissed ass worth
I just can't get past the little pissed ass
That wanna be born bad asses so bad
And they so mad they cant stand it
Cause we can and they can't speak 
And they cant handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens I snap and it's a wrap and it's a scrap and it isn't rap is it?
Hip hop isn't a sport anymore
When u gotta go and resort back to that shit
Maybe I'm old fashion but my passion is to smash any one rappin without havin to slap them 
Believe my I'd much rather have to lift a pencil than a bitch when I'm pissed out 
But it alls depends on how far it gets took on the mic 
Cause I'm telling u right now ur not gonna like it 
Cause if I get pushed over the edge I'm pullin u wit me 
U poke a stick at a pit bull u get bit
Ur words stick to u like crazy glue when u dis me 
Cause they just bounce off me like bullets do 50
I'm the beautiful instinct 
And ur gonna miss me when I'm gone 
Like keith murray when he threw his cool and hit a girl accidentally
I threw this with swifty, kon and kuniva, bizzy and proof r u wit me


Chorus - (eminem)
Good morning 
Everybody good morning
Kick ur shoes off mother fuckers good morning
Cause we get it on
Till the break of down 
And wake ur ass up mother fucker its morning
Cause we aint leavin till 6 in the morning
So help us sing along with the words of the song 
And if u don't know the words an u can't sing along 
And fake like u know em mother fuckers an join in 
And every body come on

(swifty)
The media a pitomy of beef starter 
And the party with heat
Its hard to keep u alive one
Fuck snugs 
I walk in a club with shot guns 
Constantly poppin slugs 
Aint hot son but I got one
The bosses of all bosses
I holocast anyone who ever ain't catious
In a house with dog shit
I'm a gothic death product, you'll stop breathin 
You'll die quicker than mach speed without bleedin 
And it ain't about whatch u reading 
When u meet me u better speak like a seasons greetin
Either that or we'll be beefin frequent
Niggas need a e just to speak shit 
Your leader is boutique bitch 
Keep the heater where u can reach quick
I snipe u with it and we don't even keep it a secret 
I did it from a mind of mental patient
When glocks wave u can save the conversation for Satan
You brave?

Chorus - (Eminem) 
Good morning 
Everybody good morning
Kick ur shoes off mother fucker good morning
Cause we get it on
Till the break of down 
And wake ur ass up mother fucker its morning
Cause we aint leavin till 6 in the morning
So help us sing along with the words of the song 
And if u don't know the words an u can't sing along 
And fake like u know em mother fuckers an join in 
And every body come on

(kuniva)
Yo yo I heard u niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
What the fuck did he say in his rap em?
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies as my family a couple of trucks 
Am I empty seein them ?
I empty out them ? to fight u
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors
I get urs across when I write
So emotions enough to say fuck u bitch
An I don't like u WHAT
I might as well just give this up like heavy sales 
And just fuck an leave d 12 and this blunt
We cant self disrupt
I've never felt it this much 
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like bugs
Last night of his life

(kon artist)
I walk with a limp 
Pistol hangin off tha hip
I'm awkward an quick enough 
And sick when sparkin a fith
Your carcass is split even
The beef is partially thick
We can't take u serious
You a comedy skit
U probably wish that u 
Could be out shootin them G's
But the only thing u shoot is the breeze
I can't believe u speakin on movin keys
But every time we hear u kick it
The only thing u sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
And get ur guts clapped outta ur stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get ur gun and if ur comin
