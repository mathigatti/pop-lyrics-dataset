[Eminem]
I make music to make you sick of fake music
Hate music like devil worshippin' Satan music
So say your prayers, your Hail Mary's and Jesuses
Take two sticks, tape 'em together and make a crucifix
Try to stop it but you can't do it (haha)
A whole generation of kids blowin' out their fuckin' brains to this
Kurt Cobain music, students converted to 'caine users
as soon as they heard it went out and murdered and maimed to it
What's your name? 


[Swifty]
Judas!
Got my nine with six sharpshooters, now let's do this
I got niggaz that shoots to static, you don't understand
how I'm all up in you niggaz TV's like Carole Anne
I'm a poltergeist, lyrically I'm supposed to strike
Try to snatch this mic, you get cracked with Molson Ice
(Swifty get your own woman!) I want his wife
I'm the type to go to gamblin' parties with trick dice
I rob casinos, slugs, eat those
You'd think it was the devil feedin' you jalape√±os
Now you out of the scene hoes shot at your clean clothes
My fo' fo', prone to make you niggaz breathe wrong

CHORUS [Eminem]
It's Devils Night (da da dah, da-da da da dah)
It's Devils Night (da da dah, da-da da da dah duh da)
It's Devils Night 'cause I came back to rule this time!
It's Devils Night 'cause I came back to take what's mine!
Yes it's Devils Night (da da dah, da-da da da dah)
It's Devils Night (da da dah, da-da da da dah duh da)
It's Devils Night 'cause I came back to rule this time!
It's Devils Night 'cause I came back to take what's mine!
It's Devils Night

[Kon Artis]
It's like I'm on the john, tryin' to shit and get no response
Constipated bitch, tell these pigs to back off!
The mind of rapist, Denaun never changes
Beat up strangers without a reason, I'm a anus
Walk the street in a "Beat It" jacket with a glove to match it
Drop the hat shit I put my head on opposite and step backwards
Walkin' zombied it's ornery
Pullin' armed robberies on politicians without a sense of camaraderie

[Kuniva]
Yo, I can concoct (?) slot, plus I run with the best
Hop on a motorcycle, bustin' wheelies over your chest
Bystanders standin' by, thinkin' oh what a mess
Blast through every hickie that them bitches put on your neck
What the fuck do you expect, when the slugs are dealt
And make you feel every ounce of pain that Bugz done felt
A deranged team, smokin' grams of green
This (?)'ll make your fuckin' head shake like tambourines
I pledge allegiance to the streets of the D
And if you think you out cold, catch a piece of this heat
And when it blast, it'll take off every piece of your {*scream*}
From her barrettes to her cheeks to her cute little feet

Chorus

[Bizarre]
STOP TAKIN' DRUGS! I'm tryin'
My little boy is dyin', he losin' too much iron
And if I die, it won't be because I got shot
It'll be because I tied my arm in a sock and smoked rock
Takin' drugs is cool, that's why I buy 'em
Shoot 'em up my ass, let your little brother try 'em
Ten years is what I'm facin'
Police breakin' in my house, Lil' Bow Wow in the basement (Jermaine!)
A rapist that'll bust in your mouth
I'll probably be in jail 'fore this fuckin' album comes out
I'm 18 years old, still shit in the bed
Beaten 'til I'm red, fear nothin' but war and bread
It's me again, fuckin' dirty jinn
So what if it burns, bitch when I stick it in
No medication, I'm outta percassets
I lost my weed, plus my fuckin' diaper's wet

Chorus
