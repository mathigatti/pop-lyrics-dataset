LOSE YOURSELF Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity 
To seize everything you ever wanted One moment 
Would you capture it or just let it slip? His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There'ss vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now 
The clocks run out, times up over, bloah! 
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked 
Hes so mad, but he wont give up that 
Is he? No 
He wont have it , he knows his whole back citys ropes 
It dont matter, hes dope 
He knows that, but hes broke 
Hes so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, thats when its 
Back to the lab again yo 
This whole rap shit 
He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him HOOK: You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping 
This world is mine for the taking 
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is borin, but superstardoms close to post mortar 
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him 
Coast to coast shows, hes know as the globetrotter 
Lonely roads, God only knows 
Hes grown farther from home, hes no father 
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water His bosses dont want him no mo, hes cold product They moved on to the next schmoe who flows 
He nose dove and sold nada 
So the soap opera is told and unfolds 
I suppose its old potna, but the beat goes on 
Da da dum da dum da da HOOK No more games, Ima change what you call rage 
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged 
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher 
Best believe somebodys payin the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I cant get by with my 9 to 5 
And I cant provide the right type of life for my family 
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps dont buy diapers 
And its no movie, theres no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus 
See dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama screamin on and 
Too much for me to wanna 
Stay in one spot, another jam or not 
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failures not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salems lot 
So here I go is my shot. 
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got HOOK You can do anything you set your mind to, manCLEANING OUT MY CLOSET
[Intro:]
Where's my snare? 
I have no snare on my headphones 
There you go 
Yeah 
Yo yo [Verse #1]
Have you ever been hated, or discriminated against? 
I have, I've been protested and demostrated against 
Picket signs for my wickid rhymes, look at the times 
Sick of this mind, of the mother fucking kid that's behind 
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans exploding 
Tempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep going 
Not taking nothing from no one, give em hell long as I'm breathing 
Keep kicking ass in the morning, and taking names in the evening 
Leaving with the taste of sour with viniger in they mouth 
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out 
Look at me now, I betcha prolly sick of me now 
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now [Chorus x2]
I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet 
One More Time I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet 
Ha! [Verse #2]
I got some skeletons in my closet 
And I dont know if no one knows it 
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it 
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73 
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD 
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months 
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch 
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye 
No I don't, on second thought I just fucking wished he would die 
I look at Hailey, and I couldn't picture leaving her side 
Even if I hated Kim, I grin my teeth and I try to make it work 
With her atleast for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes 
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face them today 
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb 
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun 
Cause I'd of killed em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both 
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show [Chorus x2][Verse #3]
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition 
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing 
But put yourself in my position, just try to invision 
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen 
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse when shit's missing 
Going through public housing systems, victim of munchasen syndrome 
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it? 
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma? 
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma? 
But guess what, your getting older now and it's cold when your lonely 
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that your phoney 
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful 
But you'll never see her, she wont even be at your funeral *hahaha*
See what hurts me the most, is you wont admit you was wrong 
Bitch, do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mum 
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get 
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit! 
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? 
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be [Chorus x2]
