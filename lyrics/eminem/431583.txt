You don't see me in the hood 
It's cuz I'm doin this man [Obie Trice] 
Niggaz I'm still grindin' 
I'm still hearin' those sirens 
I'm still getting chased by those lights 
Only the lights lime, and my mics on 
And my time is none 
Because I'm writing more 
And I aint here to meet a soul in this business 
I'm here to eat, speak until these hoes feel this 
And I can't let y'all derail me man 
I got young Kobe hommie, you gotta let go of Obie 
Cuz Obie be back, we get them craps going on and that giach going on 
Soon as a nigga touch down backs from tourin 
Cuz whatever put that on the cheddar man 
But in the meantime its Jimmy Ivean time 
Chase cheese rhyme till my voice give out 
This is it my nigga's, this what we boast about 
Now I'm here, so shut your muthafuckin mouth 
And show me love bitch [Chorus] 
I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night 
I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night[Eminem] 
There's a certain mystique, when I speak 
That you notice that's sorta unique, cause you know its me 
My poetries deep and I'm stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat 
You can't sit still, its like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep 
I'm strapped, just know in any minute I could snap 
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if bush rapped 
I bully these rappers so bad, lyrically 
It aint even funny, I aint even hungry, it aint even money 
You can't pay me enough, for you to play me, its cock-a-many 
You just aint zanney enough, to rock with shady 
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo 
I got screws loose, yeah the whole kitten kaboodle 
I'm just brutal, its no rumor, I'm numero uno 
Assume it, there's no humor in it 
No more you know, I'm rollin with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag 
You'll need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass 
You better love me… bitch [Chorus] 
I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night 
I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night[50 Cent] 
My boys is crazy in the hood, they holler my name 
If it aint about the flow it's about the stones and the chain 
If I was you, id love me too, I roll like a boss 
9/11 paws same color as cranberry sauce 
I aint gonna front, I thought R. Kelly was your shit 
Let me find out he fuckin round with Bow Wow bitch 
Niggaz eatin popcorn right, rewindin the tape 
Now Shorty, Momma and the Priest sit, hollerin rape 
I'm convinced man, sumtin really wrong with these hoes 
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, till she start fuckin with her nose 
Used to listen to Lauren hill, and tap my feet 
Then the bitch put out a CD, didn't have no beat 
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail 
That nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell 
My back shots help Ashanti hit them high notes 
Then Big Ben taught Charli B'more to deep throat 
Yea… [Chorus] 
I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night 
I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night
