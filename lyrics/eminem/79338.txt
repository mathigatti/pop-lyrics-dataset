If I go a million miles away
I'd write a letter each and every day
Cause honey ain't nothing, nothing
Can ever change this love I have for you
Make me weep and you can make me cry
See me coming and you can pass me by
But honey ain't nothing, nothing
Can ever change this love I have for you
You're the apple of my eye
You're cherry pie
And oh you're, cake and ice cream
Oh you're sugar and spice
And everything nice
You're the girl of my dreams
If you wanted to leave me and roam
When you got back, I'd just say welcome home
Cause honey ain't nothing, nothing
Can ever change this love I have for you
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
That nothing, nothing, nothing
Could ever, change the love I have for you
