[Chorus]
This ones for you and me
Living out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now
All I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters


[Eminem]
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck or get struck like lighting fighters
Keep fighting
Put your lighters up
Point em' skyward UH!
Had a dream I was king
I woke up
Still king
This rap games (?) is mine
For the milking
Till nobody else even fuckin feels me
Till it kill me
I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in the music
There is
Or there ever will be
Disagree? Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing, to ever give up,
Only thing I ever gave ups using
No more excuses
Excuse me if my head's to big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick
But you cocks are slick
Poppin shit on how you flipped your life around
Crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna' kid?
Flip dick you did opposite
You stayed the same
Cause cock backwards is still cock you prick
I love it when I tell'em shove it
Cause it wasn't that
Long ago
When Marshall sat
Lusted lack, lustered
Cause he couldn't cut
Mustered
Muster up
Nothin
Brain fuzzy
Cause hes buzzing
Woke up from that buzz and now you wonder
Why he does it how he does
Wasn't cause he had
Buzzards circlin' round his head
Waitin for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it cause some bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass fusses
Fuck it
Guess it doesn't matter now does it?
What difference it make
Whats it take?
To get it through you thick skulls that this ain't
Some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was as dark as I was
And just to get to this place
Some of these words be like a switchblades to a hater's rib cage
And let it be known that from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks
Cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them bics raise
Cause I came at 5'9"
But I feel like I'm 6'8"

[Chorus]
This ones for you and me
Living out our dreams
Where are right where we should be
With my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now
All I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Royce Da 5'9"]
By the time you hear this I probably already be outie
I advance like going from toting iron to goin
And buying 4 or 5 of the homies, to iron man outie
My daddy told me, slow down boy you're going to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop to be the minute to tell shady I love the same way that he did Dr. Dre on the chronic
Tell'em how real he is
Or how high I am
Or how I would kill him, for him to know it
I cry when he tears
My daddy gotta bad back
So its only right that I write
Till he can march right in to that post office and tell'em to hang it up
Now his careers Lebron's jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
Its bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up
Must come down
You goin down
I'm somethin you don't wanna see
Like a hairy box
Every hour
Happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just a cat's meow
Owwww
I'm (?)
Always down for the catch-way
Like pack it out
Yall are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself
Parks itself
And auto-tunes
Cause now I'm in the astin
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like (kronica patrick?)
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And yall' niggas the sky sippin like bitches
On a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Yall' buggin out like Wendy Williams
Starin' at a bee hive
And how real is that?
I remember signing my first deal
Now I'm the second best
I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass
Without the MTV awards gag

[Bridge]
You and I
Know what its like
To be (came down?)
Forced to fight
But tonight
We're alright
So hold up your lights
Let it shine
Cause..

[Chorus]
This ones for you and me
Living out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now
All I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
