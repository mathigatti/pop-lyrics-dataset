Song: You're my life Anna

That's it !
Here I'm again living my fuck life.


{CHORUS}
They took out my brain !
They took out my heart !
They took out my soul !
They took out my LIFE !

I've been always think that everything would be all right,
but they put in her head SHIT about me!
I've been always in love for her more than my life.

{CHORUS}
They took out my brain !
They took out my heart !
They took out my soul !
They took out my LIFE !
But in dispite of all, I will be always in love for her!

Now i don't know what will happen with me without her!
She was always the reason of my life,
when I saw her the first time, I foun inside me a heart, a onlyfeeling by a only person, but the end what I did for her?
What she decided at all?
Or is possible that she only wanted get a time?

2X
{CHORUS}
They took out my brain !
They took out my heart !
They took out my soul !
They took out my LIFE !
But in dispite of all, I will be always in love for her!

Now I'm waiting for her final decision,
Have I lost me brain, or not?
Have I lost my heart, or not?
Have I lost my soul, or not?
Have I lost me life, or not?
Have Ilost her or not?

{CHORUS}
They took out my brain !
They took out my heart !
They took out my soul !
They took out my LIFE !
But in dispite of all, I will be always in love for her!
I will be aways in love for you Anna
