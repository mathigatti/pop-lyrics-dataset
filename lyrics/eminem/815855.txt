You know, but ya actin like you don't know (don't know)...
You know, but ya actin like you don't know

This flow, is gon bring more dough
And you know, but ya acting like you don't know

[50 Cent]
Now homie I say I run it run it, cuz I'm in control
Hypnotic, Hennessey, a couple shots of pa trom
I have you feelin aight, I get you high as a kite
Party pops, shorty says you comin with me tonight
I ain't sellin da linen
I ain't snappin n poppin, either I'm bobbin my head
Or I'm just standin there watchin
I'm a hustler I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga you front you gon get it, ok, now maybe I'm civic
Cuz I want you to trip it, yea, I be on that shi-deh
You should see what I'm stuntin, I flash the stones they be wantin
Push the whips see me rollin, you can tell that I'm haulin
I'm just doin my thang, you know the units the game
I got my grind, me shady wit me, you front you gon have to get me
Off your ass, I pay the lawsuit and laugh (Ha-ha)
It's not a big deal, it's nothin but some cash

[50 Cent]
You know, ya actin like you don't know
I tear the club off, fo-sho
This flow, is gon bring more dough
And you know, but ya acting like you don't know
You know, ya actin like you don't know
I tear the club off, fo-sho
This flow, is gon bring more dough
And you know, but ya acting like you don't know

[Eminem]
When me and fif got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretentious, this friendship, me nemesis is su nemesis
Ain't for him, this is media, see to them its just images
But this shit is no gimmicks
This is blood in and blood out
When there's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it
We don't resolve it, it usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge, around our, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holding the most current peep on they shoulders
And the soldiers got their backs and its over
But tonight we ain't comin here to beef with nobody
We came to party
Banks, Cashis, and Mr. Ferrari
So its Shady After-mizz-ath, backin that ass, you wiz-ass
Come-izzle-hmm
What kinda puzz-up-ple position is that

(Tony Yayo) Cashis! Break it down now!

(Cashis)
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over, bleedin, JFK
Az-K to yo chest plate, K I'm
Ridin till the death, do you rep that way
Forever, Ima be a Shady 7-4 gangster
Pus else involve everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin in all beef
You keep talkin shit, and now the squad will call me

[Lloyd Banks]
Enough opened bag of steam, Em let off a magazine, got the guns, cap a queen, mixed in with Cashis queens
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin ain't my cup o tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' G?
Ima hold a matic, when I'm addict, start static and you strat it shit shatter
Im a walking bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot
For my digits, ya dig it?
