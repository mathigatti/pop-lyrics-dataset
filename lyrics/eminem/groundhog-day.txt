What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn’t superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna’s stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn’t work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can’t do this again


Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna’ do is listen she’s like
Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are kryptonite
To the walls and I’ve lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into them, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind, Superman
Cos I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion

“I remember it clearly, even today”
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned
Always itchin’ for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day
And discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain’t listened to the wizard
You ain’t have a fucking clue what you was missing

I’d zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing’s wishing
For shoes, fuck them stupid pumas bitch
It’s all about them new editionS
You get the new LL Cool J
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I found my future is in this
That’s how I know my mission
Little boom box boomin’, spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms

When I sit in my room
Envisioning my dreams come true for wishin’
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn’t wait to play him my new shit
He’d go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his shit
It’s like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit

Never quit, too persistent
Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain’t no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
If you got dissed at the shop cause if they caught you slippin'

They’d take your spot if someone got to rippin’ you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocked us once, it ain’t knocking again
It tried dong ditching shit
I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen Slim
now I got my pot to piss in
I’m in a league Muhammad’s in

All these, bombing them
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like Ndamukong
I’m rushing at the
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme’s face
So name the time, place to battle
Bitch I’m still in that mind state
Don’t make me step on you and make you wine grapes

Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you’re sore losers
Ooh, no more trippin in bird shit
This song’s a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but this…
The rap games God, but the name’s not James Todd?
I’m just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
‘Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells and doors ain’t workin’ out
Each verse is more, than the first
And you ain’t got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast?

To get served
they shall not escape my vengeance
And I’m the kid with them ears like Dumbo’s gone
Word to Uncle Ron
I’m turning into an unhumble Don
You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on
Better back away from the front row, get gone
Bigger then Dikembe Mutumbo
I’m the fucking jungle tron
I’m a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I’ll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yard

So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I’m fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The GOAT just ate eight acres, and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
Like oak wood was burning
Return of the no good
