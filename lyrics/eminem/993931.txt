[Mos Def - talking] 
Man, you hear this bullshit they be talkin' 
Every day, man 
It's like these motherfuckers is just like professional liars 
You know what I'm sayin ? It's wild 
Listen 


[Hook - Mos Def] 
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects 
It was you, nigga 
Tell the truth, nigga 
(Bush knocked down the towers)--[Jadakiss] 
Tell the truth, nigga 
(Bush knocked down the towers)--[Jadakiss] 
Tell the truth, nigga 

[Verse 1 - Immortal Technique] 
I pledge no allegiance, nigga fuck the president's speeches 
I'm baptized by America and covered in leeches 
The dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features 
Drownin' you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers 
And if you speak about the evil that the government does 
The Patriot Act'll track you to the type of your blood 
They try to frame you, and say you was tryna sell drugs 
And throw a federal indictment on niggaz to show you love 
This shit is run by fake Christians, fake politicians 
Look at they mansions, then look at the conditions you live in 
All they talk about is terrorism on television 
They tell you to listen, but they don't really tell you they mission 
They funded Al-Qaeda, and now they blame the Muslim religion 
Even though Bin Laden, was a CIA tactician 
They gave him billions of dollars, and they funded his purpose 
Fahrenheit 9/11, that's just scratchin' the surface 


[Hook] 


[Verse 2 - Immortal Technique] 
They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam 
But that's bullshit, I'll show you why it's totally wrong 
Cuz if another country invaded the hood tonight 
It'd be warfare through Harlem, and Washington Heights 
I wouldn't be fightin' for Bush or White America's dream 
I'd be fightin' for my people's survival and self-esteem 
I wouldn't fight for racist churches from the south, my nigga 
I'd be fightin' to keep the occupation out, my nigga 
You ever clock someone who talk shit, or look at you wrong? 
Imagine if they shot at you, and was rapin' your moms 
And of course Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons 
We sold him that shit, after Ronald Reagan's election 
Mercenary contractors fightin' a new era 
Corporate military bankin' off the war on terror 
They controllin' the ghetto, with the failed attack 
Tryna distract the fact that they engineerin' the crack 
So I'm strapped like Lee Malvo holdin' a sniper rifle 
These bullets'll touch your kids, and I don't mean like Michael 
Your body be sent to the morgue, stripped down and recycled 
I fire on house niggaz that support you and like you 
Cuz innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily 
And poor people never get shit and struggle daily 
This ain't no alien conspiracy theory, this shit is real 
Written on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal 

(I don't rap for dead presidents 
I'd rather see the president dead 
It's never been said but I set precedents)--[Eminem]

(Shady Records was 80 seconds away from the towers 
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours)-- [Eminem]
