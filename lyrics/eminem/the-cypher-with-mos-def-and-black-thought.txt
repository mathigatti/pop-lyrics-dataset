[Verse 1: Mos Def]
For sinners saints and scramblers and gamblers
And dirty money handlers, dignitaries and champions, narcotic traffickers
Talented number runners and racketers
Stars of stage, page and cameras, slang swingers and swaggerers
Double barrels and Derringers, automatics and miracles
Europe Asia and Africa, all the time in America
Atlantic, Ashland, Alblemarle to Albany
Bridge into Baltic, Bedford Ave, Bergen Street
Clinton to Cadman, Church Ave to Clarendon
Road to Central Avenue, Cooper House, Cypress
And live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest high flyingest pilot bombardier from Pyrrhus
Stationed live and direct, Medina mastermind set
Ya can't lock my set now lock off, cool
Peace to the nation of the Gods and the Earths
And the Sun, Moon and stars, Furthermore born knowledge go hard


[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Remix, rising up outta the flames like a phoenix
Training to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowing I'm sowing them seeds let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said it I mean it and did it because I need it
Eat sleep it and eat it, write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement, your trash talk is deleted
Blastoff, I lay them out like a Tempurpedic
Black Thought, I told you I'mma win eventually
This unsung, underrated, under appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated from something that's so hated
To one of the most sacred, nobody gonna take it
Face it, I keep doing it well, doing it (?)
Is do it yourself, doing it below the radar
We doing it stealth, doing it again
For Illadelph and who else? But check it out
Y'all see him on a job, see my eyes focused where the prize be
I'm like Martin Luther King you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear Diary, my fans still swear by me
Even though I'm late night now like here's Johnny
Swimming with them big whites now is where you'll find me
Funny how it break right down but never mind me
I'm forever grimy, guess it's just Philly shining
Rock rolla bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Like a dope fiend opening up a bottle of dopamine
You're just hoping you don't get roped for your throat get choked anything
Oh and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything
Oh, there goes the bell, the sound of the opening ding
I hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs with a switch
And stitch you a the same time before you can flinch to it
My dick is so big, if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I raped you that you was actually into it
I'm not a baller but you can bet your fuckin' bottom dollar
That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet
Now watch me kill a koala while I maul a chihuahua
Bum a pill off of Paula like let me holler at you mama
It's like I'm off the bomba when I bring the fuckin' drama
Used to bomb ya like Saddam but now that I'm a little calmer
I'm a fuckin' cross between Osama Dahmer Obama and Dalai Lama
So Miley I'm a knight in shining armor
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer a picture
Of my genitalia with a note saying bitch I can't wait to nail ya
Drug paraphernalia beware the werewolf will kill ya
That's him in the sheep's clothes, he just shaved his hair off Cecilia
