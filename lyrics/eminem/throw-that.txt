She strips, to get tips
Those lips and those childbearing hips
I’ll throw this, I’ll throw this dick on you girl (girl)
I’ll throw this, I’ll throw this dick on you girl (girl)


Gonna make you feel me,
gonna shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with little dingalings
But not me, I-I throw this dick on you girl
I throw this, I throw this dick on you girl
