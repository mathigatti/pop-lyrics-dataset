It never found that somebody came 
and demonstrated the feelings that it always dreamed. 
It did not plan if to get passionate, 
worried about the balance that it wanted for more time 


This road for the recovery 
is taking everything what I have. 
It seems more difficult, the more I I try. 
to lose one more time, plus a time

Well, it lost the control when he gave up its heart, 
to follow the girl that it always dreamed. 
It ran away scared with a love, 
would be better if it had planned.

This road for the recovery 
is taking everything what I have. 
It seems more difficult, the more I I try. 
to lose one more time, plus a time

Well, the love is a drug, 
relationships finishes. 
What she happens now that that person if was? 
That one that you thought that always it could count. 
You get passionate yourself and they fall outside. 
Love is a drug, all the relationships finishes.

How I can leave a love that meant pra in such a way me? 
As I can continue when you still I am part of me? 
I am dying all time that I see you. 
he does not lose me of sight, because you he is everything that I see. 
you still is everything that I see. 

This road for the recovery is taking everything what I have. 
this road for the recovery is taking everything what I have, 
taking everything that I have.
