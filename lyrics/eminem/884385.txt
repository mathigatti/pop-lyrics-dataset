Detroit, motown
Hey guess what?
They gave us a soup bowl this year
And you know what happened?


Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murder, murdeeeerrrr) (2x)

[bizarre]
Hennyed up, remmyed up, ski mask, black truck
Dickie outfit, passenger side (mr. grip pump)
Fuck it, i just did two lines
A chrome tech nine, it'll tear out nigga's spine
It's a party, go on in and have fun
'cause after it's over, all you goin' hear is {*gunshots*}
Shootin', blastin', hittin' the floor
$10,000 in the safe, shit i'm about to score
'cause i'm dangerous, off angel dust, shit i'll bust
Even the nigga that came wit' us
And this is for my niggas that be robbin' and stealin'
Carjackin', murder one's and fuckin' drug dealin's

Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murder, murdeeeerrrr) (2x)

[kuniva]
I stumble in the club blowed, 9 millimeter cocked
Something's tellin' me to stop, fuck it, i ain't see the cops
Niggas don't believe it till they see it's out
Stupid motherfuckers wanna take a scenic route
Now the heaters out, bitches scream like i pulled my penis out
Beggin' me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that mink
Come out of them diamonds and you come out of that valuer
The party is over, shut the fuck down, cut the music
Matter of fact turn it back it up, shit i can use it
I need the noise, in case i have to let a couple off
Saw another icy chain, walked over and tugged it off
Gimme that butter soft, they say she buyin' out the bar
You can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow
I'm out for the paper, my homie, better hide them jewels
I'm in the game starvin' and i ain't playin' by the rules nigga

Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murder, murdeeeerrrr) (2x)

[50 cent] s-s-s-s-s-shady
[eminem] it's the re-up
