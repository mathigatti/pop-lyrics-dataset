Can u smile with everyone on your back
(everyone screamin', everyone yellin')
Without the sensitivity there is no fact
(i see u runnin, i see u're scared)


Chorus 2

U will feel..
The wrath of me..
Can u see..
Wut i want u 2 be..

[verse]
I cant see
(its blinding)
Ur love
(used to be so blinding)
But now all i feel
(is the fading taste)
Of ur opinion
(the theory that used to be)
But now stuck in the vibe
(is my heart..)

U will feel..
The wrath of me..
Can u see..
Wut i want u 2 be..
U will feel..
The wrath of me..
Can u see..
Wut i want u 2 be..

Can u smile with everyone on your back
(everyone screamin', everyone yellin')
Without the sensitivity there is no fact
(i see u runnin, i see u're scared)
Can u smile with everyone on your back
(everyone screamin', everyone yellin')
Without the sensitivity there is no fact
(i see u runnin, i see u're scared)
Can u smile with everyone on your back
(everyone screamin', everyone yellin')
Without the sensitivity there is no fact
(i see u runnin, i see u're scared)
Can u smile with everyone on your back
(everyone screamin', everyone yellin')
Without the sensitivity there is no fact
(i see u runnin, i see u're scared)

U will feel..
The wrath of me..
Can u see..
Wut i want u 2 be..
U will feel..
The wrath of me..
Can u see..
Wut i want u 2 be..
