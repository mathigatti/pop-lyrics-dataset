Many have come and gone
still left out of this gutteral swansong
taking nothing but the best in your area
give me grief but fucker i'll stare you down
2,3 you're outta there
maybe it's me but i'm frantic in a panic
ain't never had a problem
since you stopped coming here
big man walking but bitch i'm still talking


Can't you see it's gotta be this way ?

give me any reason why i need you (boy)
give me any reason why i need you (boy)
give me any reason why i need you (boy)
give any reason not to fuck you up

Ain't gonna leave
and you know it's never gonna fade
here it comes again
gonna burn again
tied down, goes down know i'm trippin
and i'm runnin' on your ugly ass face cuz
i ain't the one that set you up
and i ain't the one that set you off
but i know damn well
when someone's pushing my buttons
let me tell you something
i'll push you back !

(as soon as that camera is off he gonna fuck that little dog)

give me any reason why i need ya (punk )
give me any reason why i need ya (punk)
give me any reason why i need ya (punk)
give me any reason not to fuck you up

give me any reason why i need ya (bitch)
give me any reason why i need ya (bitch)
give me any reason why i need ya (bitch)
give me any reason not to fuck you up

(in the beginning the sample sayz fuck you)
