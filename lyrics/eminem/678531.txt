Verse 1

When there come and left for dead
I've been out of my head
and now i wanna be bigger
bein' here with you
it's not so hard to be
I can see my dreams
I know im gunna be better
my friends always say


Chorus

my friends always say
that everything will be okay
but it don't always, work out that way
so her i am again
beleivin in, cause i remember when
baby

I had the time of my life
everything is right with you
after all that i've been through
I aint tried to lose
this time of my life, with you
baby

Verse 2

People say I'm out of line
So much on my mind
Like i wanna be bigger
sometimes it dont rhyme
but when you're here with me
I have poetry
I know im gunna be better
and my friends always say


[Chorus]

One day they will see
the giant baby
finally see me smile
hear me laughing, out loud
my voice will be heard
its no longer absurd
and i hope you hear
cause baby, baby
i haaaaddd...

I had the time of my life
everything is right with you
after all that i've been through
I aint tried to lose
gotta make my move and groove
everything i can 

I had the time of my life
time of my life, with you
baby, take my hand
because im going to go on to
this time of my life, with you
baby
i had the time of my life
time of my life, with you
