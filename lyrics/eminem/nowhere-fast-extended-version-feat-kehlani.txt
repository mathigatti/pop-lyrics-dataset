Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas
Another lone-wolf gunman
Sometimes I don't know what this
World has come to, it's blowin' up
And this whole country is goin' nuts
And the NRA is in our way
They're responsible for this whole production
They hold the strings to control the puppets
And they threaten to take away donor bucks
So they know the government won't do nothin'
And no one's budgin', gun owners' clutchin'
Their loaded weapons
They love their guns more than our children
Shh, I think another one just entered in our buildin'
And we'll be


Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

I feel sorry for this beat
Sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin' me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd
Be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn't scaring us, we pass
Nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just

Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
Goin' nowhere fast

Fuck doin' what you're told
Act like a two-year-old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place
It's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin' we have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch
War machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run, I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
'Til the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just

Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no, goin' no
Goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Going nowhere fast

You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other
When we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh-oh
No more tomorrows, we're done (we're done)
And all we are is

Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah (don't care, yeah)
(We don't give a, no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no, goin' no
Goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast
