I'm stumbling, I can’t see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again
Now I’m the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for


All my life, I was told
I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it
Every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot the hell up
Falling helplessly, I'm embarrased
And I don't want no one else to see
’Cause I feel like I’m a piece of shit
Every time she yells at me
Selfishly indeed
But definitely doesn't help that she
Makes me feel like I’ve died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip
Now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms
I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string
She lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she’ll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain
But I'm okay, though
'Cause I know she loves me
My friends, what do they know?

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

In my moments of weakness
I openly admit this shit, I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious
And enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture
When she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her
In this war
When she gets going, she don't stop
When I'm up, she's like a downer
When I found her
It was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow, she must've took the carton
Of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground
For me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something 'bout her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it
When I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist
Make a believer out of me
And show me the way now
Or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain
I'm drowning

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

It took a while for me to get it
But I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna
See me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy
Destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces
Brings her joy, brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me
Get this straight, then say screw her
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick
I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door
So here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
This time, this piece of shit's running through her
I can see that right now, I'm running to it
What the fuck? Should've knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings
