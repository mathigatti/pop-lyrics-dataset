You're my angel
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
In your arms
You're my angel
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
In your arms


I dont think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right, I would of stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life, I would have laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect, I demand it
Imma take control of this relationship
Command it, and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit

And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Paved for all the way, this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I aint heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness

And I know that if I end this, I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase, its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back, so dont hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
Did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept

You're my angel
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
In your arms
You're my angel
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
In your arms

So many doubt 'cause I come from the south
But when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out
Bang! Die bitch nigga die I hope you bleed a lake
I'ma play x-ray, helpin' y'all see the fake
I'm just tryin' to be the great, tryin' to get a piece of cake
Take it offa your plate, eat it right in your face
They got a whole lot to say but I don't listen
Call me automatic weezy bitch I keep spittin', pow

Now some of em wanna family, a sense of security,
Neckless, bracelets and all other types of jewelery,
So, shop till you drop, or till it makes you psychotic,
Heres a triple black card, it ain't trickin if you got it!
Others will stay content if you just makin 'em laugh,
Send 'em to the spa, get a massage then bubble bath,
So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand,
And try any and everything they never did with they man, me!

So get loose and slide off your damn garments,
Show 'em whose the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on your body that I'm tryin to find,
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me what's on your mind,
And I got plenty more to learn if you'z invested in me,
They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to be,
And for that!, I'll give you everything up under the sun,
Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun!

You're my angel
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
In your arms
You're my angel
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms

Gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself, in his position but remain silent
I get to thinking bout the shit we been through
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
This life of sin, that got the both of us in trouble
But you you always stay down for a nigga so that's why I love you
Reminiscing needing tissues
Fighting over childish issues, swear I can't live with you
But without you everyday I miss you

Word on roll you hold my pistol
My gangsta bitch that you always in the mood for love
That's why I'm sleeping with you
Though not the man of your dreams, my planted schemes to be rich like a king
And live my life trouble free
I see, yesterday I called you names, and played games on your mind
I promise that I'll change in time
It's a complicated world so girl just be a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again

Yo things was all fine when the sun was shining
But when the rain came that's when the pain came
Sittin' up in the range
She feels some kinda way
She doing strange things
But I ain't with the games
Just keep it a secret yo
It's cheaper to keep her bro
Two wrongs don't make us right
But we equal though
It's getting better though
And I can't sweat her
And I love her
But I can't let her know
I can't let her go

You're my angel
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
In your arms
You're my angel
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms

You're my angel
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
In your arms
You're my angel
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
