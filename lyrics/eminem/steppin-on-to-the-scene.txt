Eat 'em
Every time I come back, I’m putting the mask on my head
Beat the sons of a bitches so hard that they forget where they’re at
I ain’t saying the same thing every time I attack
Damn, I just got whooped by a new jack
A new jack, may be new, let me jack
Design a few [?] the fact
Of an experience lack
I just ignore 'em
Take my energy and store it
Who want decided to get brave
Then I pour it, pour it
On his ass
Like milk over a wilted plant
Constantly tromping in and around
To get paid again


I drink beer
So, you better steer clear
’Cause I steer and smear
The grip who interferes
Ripping a bastard up in less than a minute
Let’s get hunked by a truck
Suck a straw with answers in it
Suckers are dropping in the back that I stood
I can rhyme while I’m puking and it would still sound good
Even when out of gas
I’m pulling rhymes from my ass
You won't be think as fast enough to talk through the glass
Rain rhymes, you performed a song that you regret
While my money is due, so I can let through the exit
And let's get hangin' at [zen?]
Part of me’s so bad
’Cause I prefer to leave a blur
When I stirred your ass
