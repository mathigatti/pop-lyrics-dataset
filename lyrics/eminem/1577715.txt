I can hear your heartbeat, your scared, yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat, your scared (x2)


[Chorus]
You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I see, I come at night, boy, I kill you, you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry

[50 cent]
Look look, I've come from a different crew
You f-ck with me, I'll get to you
A clip or two, I'll cripple you
'cause I ain't got sh-t to do
Pistol poppin, a p-ssy drop
Drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie miney moe
Now try pow a 44
Pick a strap to take the mag
To hold and stab it in your back
I'll blow your brain, I know your name
And where you rest, I'll make a mess
The holla tipsy in ch-chest
Call for blood to EMS
Come pick you up
You know you f-cked when
You get on a strecther
'cause I'll come in ICU
To see you off to heaven
The system out I done been through
There's nothing new to me
They locked me up they left me out
You seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals
Why they up in corrections
They come and get at 9
***** crown me a perfection
It's murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistic
But they can't find a fingerprint the shit's going terrific
He's so close to your target that it's really hard to miss it

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Man these are average raps, you keepin the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass what the shady aftermath did
You pop off the top its like opening vats of acid
Beat the octamom to death with a cabbage patch kid
Attack a snatch ya theres something to jack a bad chin
Impregnated the chewed up the embryo sack with mack 10s
Triplets quadruplets and a couple of back to back twins
That fetus is fallin out all over jack is back again
The rippers at your service, girl I can see that your nervous
But I barely scratch the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fuckin backyard still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out
Its past your curfew when its dark, Im searchin for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found a coat all rolled up
Inside a bag he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA no not a drop
Cause me and dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI they hate us but they gotta give alot of props
The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter top

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Yeah, Im as ill as can be
my appeal is to serial killers what appeals to me,
killing so villainously,
still as maniacal on the night going psycho
its michael myers,
you know what were like on the muthaf-cking mic,
so try us and your gonna find out,
what the fuck were like with pliers,

[50 cent]
its operation time got em
hooked up to wires,
squeeze em, he bleeding, wheezing, breathing he half dead,
he must not know but now he now how shady the math is,
even murderous tactics get better with practice,
lead showers, gun powder, fill the tellers burn burn,
truly ours Julia, you better learn learn,

[Eminem]
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah homie turn turn,
Im debating, mutilating the lady,
youve been waiting for shady and fif, ain't no duplicating it baby,
theres a baby in the drive, theres a torso in the washer,
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her,
arms and legs in the garbage cos the rest of her,
I lost her, her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her,
i put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub,

[50 Cent]
When I'm through with Ricky it'll will be blood that'll cough up
a hard rock soft f-ck (?)
get caught up and get washed up,
in Detroit or Northfolk,
when it's disrupt and nauseas,
look deep in my eye and see many many many men die,
I swing gym stars faster than samurai,

[Chorus]
