Two Of You 
(Track 12 on "Rotator") Why tell me why
There's a river to cry tonight
Oh why
Try don't you try
You can never deny what's right
Don't you tryLook at me
Caught
In your mystery
I'm giving twice the feeling
And I'm not receiving
Now my head is turning
And my eyes are burning
It's the truth I'm learning
What am I to do
With two of youWhy tell me why
There's a river to cry tonight
Oh why
Try don't you try
You can never deny what's right
Don't you tryI can see
You made a fool of me
And you've been double dealing
This is so revealing
Which of you is Mary
I can't tell it can't be
You've both been deceiving
What am I to do
With two of you
