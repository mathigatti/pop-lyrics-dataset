They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them
As the sound climbs higher on this violent rhythm
For you snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
I ain't scared of ya teeth, I admire what's in em
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already, hit em! Yeah, you gotta be kidding
Wanna talk about a victim, I'mma put you there with 'em!


This are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be
What you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these .... see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games, til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night and ain't prayin'
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man I'm done saying that I'm done playing, I'm a start laying
Into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down, like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man, bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, oh, yo, ho, hold up
Oh no, not me, not Marshall!
You wanna see Marshall?
I'll show you Marshall!
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's

They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them
As the sound climbs higher on this violent rhythm
For you snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
I ain't scared of ya teeth, I admire what's in em
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already, hit em! Yeah, you gotta be kidding
Wanna talk about a victim, I'mma put you there with 'em!

No regret for the confidence betrayed
No more hiding in shadow
Cause I won't wait for the debt to be repaid
Time has come for you!

Said money change a situation
Big said it increase the complication
Kane said, 'Don't  I ain't the one."
Chuck said that Uzi weigh a motherfucking ton
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me
Rocking and rocking and rocking and rocking, rock, rocking every stage
I'm awfully underrated
But came here to correct it
And so it ain't mistaken, I'mma state it for the record
I am the opposite of whack
Opposite of weak, opposite of slacks
Synoym of heat, synonym of crack
Closest to a peak, far from a punk
You all ought to stop talking
Start trying to catch up, motherfucker!

They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them
As the sound climbs higher on this violent rhythm
For you snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
I ain't scared of ya teeth, I admire what's in em
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already, hit em! Yeah, you gotta be kidding
Wanna talk about a victim, I'mma put you there with 'em!

Victimized, victimized, never again victimized
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized

Because I won't wait for the dead to be repaid
I will wait for the dead to be repaid
Cause I won't wait for the dead to be repaid
Cause I won't wait for the dead to be repaid
Cause I won't wait for the dead to be repaid
Cause I won't wait for the dead to be repaid

They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them
As the sound climbs higher on this violent rhythm
For you snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
I ain't scared of ya teeth, I admire what's in em
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already, hit em! Yeah, you gotta be kidding
Wanna talk about a victim, I'mma put you there with 'em!
