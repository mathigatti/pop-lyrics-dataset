[ Verse 1 ] [ Eminem ] 

It has been said, that there has been known to be blood shed 
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead 
Strapped to beds, bite bombs dynamite lead 
Money, power, respect, street cred, yeah 
It's scary aint it? Picture yourself going out as a hero 
Picth a Mural, pictures of us painted all over street corners 
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners 
Notorious tried to warn us 
So many piggy bank off of, Biggie's back and Pac's 
Landmarks, history in rap, statistically in fact 
It's so sad to see us re-enact 
These tragic events, which lead us back 
To where we left of March 9th to come from such hard knock life's 
And make it out of the bottom to hit the spotlights 
Once the artist, this is our lives 
Cast out for all eyes 
And he who lasts the longest must be the strongest 
In this concrete jungle 
Where this dog eat dog mentality comes from 
This origin, which is usually originated from cats are starving 
Or it could just be somebody's horror that just horrifies 
And applies to his persona or the sizes in his entourage 
That intimidates the people to the point 
You know that he's gangster, he aint gotta say shit you just believe it 


[ Verse 2 ] [ Obie Trice ] 

Since Big taught us niggas to think big 
I'm been about my business since then so it aint Cheers 
It aint how we live, it's what he said he did it for Brooklyn 
This I took in, sent chills through my skin 
Vicious, I've experienced in the same sights as him 
It's what excited Obie to write these poems 
Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken 
Open up my eyes there's no limit in them skies 
When Ready 2 Die was a sick part of my life 
Pummin that .45, plotting to pop my mind 
Then that crooked eye Jamaican, I'd so many times Rewind 
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind 
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs? 
No pop of mine could top Big Poppas rhymes 
So possibly I'd be popular huh? 
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga P.I 


[ Verse 3 ] [ P Diddy ] 

I took a coal, a diamond, I moulded his mind, enter 
The most phenomenal artist of any and all time 
I made a Frankenstein, my designs impressed 
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess 
Critics lash, said I made a fortune of his past an' 
All is did was build a dynasty off of his passion 
And I'm addressing the adolesence absent to who he is 
The original king of New York Christopher Wallace 
This is a promise on Diddy's honor 
I'm a father to ya'll and teach ya with all the drama 
Don't even bother, or repeat 
All of your albums play back to back 
And I visit your grave cause our friendships intact 
An ammaculate concept, extravagant progress 
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling God bless 
Regardless to critics yelling that 'east-west' 
I seen the game loosing, I'm just pressing the reset 
When the ressurection of you shines through an individual 
Lyrical enough, doing the same ??? literally 
I'ma pay homage, brooklyns finest 
Wether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom
