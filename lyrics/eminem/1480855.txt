[Intro]
YO YO... Follow me... Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man will go to this place, the devil only knows, of this world
so dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold... oh so cold... oh


[Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side of the world, so cold and so dark

(Stay Wide Awake)
They only know a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay Wide Awake)
And not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay Wide Awake)

[Verse 1]
Fe Fi Fo Fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter central park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I've seen my target, pit my car, and park and approach the tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you might-a
Heard of me before, see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd-a
ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umberella then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kinda guy to smile but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah now let's see her have triplets then I'll-di
cintigrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde-
hide in cyanide girl you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
No need for no gun powder, that only takes all the fun outta
Murderin' I'd rather go vin vin and no you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, err
Shit, wait a minute I mean skull, my knife seems dull, pull another one out, uh

[Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side of the world, so cold and so dark

(Stay Wide Awake)
They only know a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay Wide Awake)
And not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay Wide Awake)

[Verse 2]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's making me play hide and seek, like Jason, I'm so hungry
She's naked see, no privacy, but I can see she wants me
So patient see, I try to be, but she why does she taunt me
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep, and i creep right through the front see
So blatantly, but silently, cause I know that she's sound sleep
Who's waking me so violently, and why's he on top of me
He's raping me she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me
He's taping me, he's biting me, he's laughing like it's funny
She's scraping me, she's fighting me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escaping me, no dice you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan G, what a sight to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man life can be so empty
Stay away from me, 'cause I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat

[Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side of the world, so cold and so dark

(Stay Wide Awake)
They only know a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay Wide Awake)
And not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay Wide Awake)

[Verse 3]
Better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, It's your soul I'ma try to take
Pray for life today, right away, why do they try to fight today
I must make them pay twice as much, might aswell put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scower you for 6 hours, til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement, now ya
Must've just heard the sound of my stomach growling from down there
Prowler there's no one fowler, Bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown ya, with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now, like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
Jabba the Hut betty-bah-bah betty-bye-bye It's time to die-die
Oughtta not even bother to scream it don't even matter
Amazing at raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nodding like son of sam, so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt, there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hacking them up with that
What was that, dial 911, someone's coming in from the back

[Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side of the world, so cold and so dark

(Stay Wide Awake)
They only know a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay Wide Awake)
And not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay Wide Awake)
