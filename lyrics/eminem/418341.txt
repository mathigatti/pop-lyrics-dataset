[Eminem speaking]
You know people just don't, people just don't see how much work
is really involved in this rap shit
I didn't know it, I didn't see it
I never saw it until I was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
to understand what it's like
But you always gotta
people always gotta see your smile
You always gotta put on that fake
You know wha' I'm sayin'?
No matter what you just been through
you just gotta be right 


CHORUS [B-Real]
So you wanna be a rap superstar, and live large
A big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world 
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

[B-Real]
I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Lookin' in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
To rock crowds make money
Chill wit' the honeys
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny, how impossible cream manifest in the games that be comin' with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know, about the blood sweat and tears and losin' some of your peers
and losin' some of your self 
Music has past gone by
Hopefully you don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac in the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shits deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill, but never will 
'til he crosses over still
Feelin' no hate
But fantasies come wit' these
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin' cheese
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
and take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games 
But the price of fame is high
and some can't pay to play
Trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing 
No fans, no fame
No respect, no change
No women and everyone shits on your name

Chorus 2x

[Noreaga speaking]
When you sign to a record label
you don't know you sign your life over
and these white boys don't care about you
'cause the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
and they'll find another Capone-n-Noreaga
and they'll find another B-Real
So you need to just keep 
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while you're hot
And mafuckin' get out the game
Stick to the drug game and the drug game is even worse
Because if somebody jerk you 
You could shoot 'em and kill 'em, and if
In this game if somebody jerk you
you gotta be humble

[Eminem speaking]
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
and everything's gotta be all good
When you see somebody slap hands with 'em
You know what I'm sayin' give em a pound or whatever it is, you know?
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit

Chorus 2x

[B-Real]
My own son don't know me
I'm chillin' in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm wit' my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
'cause they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like monie and the press say that
My own people disowned me and the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honeys at the palladium
Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on, go on, fall off, the hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar, wit' no shame
give him a year and they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin' ignored
I warned him, assured him
This ain't easy take it from weezy 
Sleazy people wanna be so cheesy they talkin' evil

Chorus 2x
