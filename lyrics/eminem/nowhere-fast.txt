Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care
Yeah
Wasted, you always on the road
Never looking back and we’re never getting old
'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast


I feel sorry for this beat
Sympathy pains for this track
This road is taking me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I’m simply stating a fact, I had Ridley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and, fast
Another terrorist attacks, like a tariff grows
Half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast but that doesn't scare us
We pass no one, we're fearless
'Cause we're just

Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care
Yeah
Wasted, you always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We’re going nowhere fast

'Cause we’re going no, going no
Going no, going no
Going no, going nowhere
Going nowhere fast

Fuck doing what you're told
Act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways
For emcees it’s a funeral when I'm devising this rhyme
Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That’s why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto guts provide oh nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I must have got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful really don't mean nothing all though
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems like it's in the wrong place
It's probly cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life
Avoid or veer or just steer toward it
We're only looking forward but
Where we're going, we have no idea
Nowhere to go but hysterical
It's getting warm in here, I set the world on fire
Was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch
War machine but you've forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have something for your ear
And in the course of the assault is torture, it's more severe
Go to war with me or end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up blewn in your career (North Korea?)
All in all, it's said and done
And at the end of my run, I just rewind clocks
Forever young, make time stop
Will I ever fall off, that day'll never come
To the Pine box, bitch fuck you
I'm better than I ever was
Til the bomb drops, hope it never does but
I'm not gonna sweat it cause this
World's screwed, it's already fucked and I'm on top
So everyone's just

Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care
Yeah
Wasted, you always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

'Cause we're going no, going no
Going no, going no
Going no, going nowhere
Going nowhere fast

You can't tell us nothing
Hardheaded and we're stubborn
So, working out the other when we're young
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter, Uh oh
And more tomorrow's we're done
And all we are is

Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care
Yeah
Wasted, you always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

'Cause we're going no, going no
Going no, going no
Going no, going nowhere
Going nowhere fast
