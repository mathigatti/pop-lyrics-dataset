Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeed in fulfilling
Don’t think I ever stopped to think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast, it was like I blinked, sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember
Is feeling ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feeling
Like I am always under attack man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling
Women dish him but really thinking
If anyone talks to my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I’m a little bit of a hypocrite
When I’m ripping shit, but since when did this many
People ever give a shit what I had to say
It’s just my opinion
If it contradicts how I’m living
Put a dick in your rear end, your rear end that’s why
Every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it
For drawing more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude
Thought I was that important
But you can’t ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battle for it, mad awards, annoyed
Attaboy, they told me to slow down, and I just zone out
Good luck trying to convince a blonde
That’s like telling gwen stefan’ that she sold out
Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt
In anyone’s mind one day I’d go down
In history think they know now
Because everybody knows


Skylar Grey:
Everybody knows, that you’re just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don’t pretend to be nice
There’s no place you can hide, you are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Thanks for the support, asshole *scratch* thanks for the support, asshole

Quit acting salty
I was counting on you to count me out as asher roth
When he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history
But goddamn, honkey, that compliment’s like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Lay’em off it
But what the fuck is all this thrash talking about
The fight was fixed, I’m back and you can’t stop me
You knock me down, I went down from the counter
I fell but the fans caught me, and now
You’re gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me
To take my belt, word to pacquiao
Momma said there ain’t nothing else to talk about
Gotta go in that ring and knock them out
Or you better not come out
It’s poetry emotion, like freddie roach when he’s quoting shakespeare
So what if the insults are revolting
Even helen keller knows life stinks
You think it’s a joke til you’re bullet riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a glock
Just to go out watch batman
Who needs to test the testicles, not that man
Half of you don’t got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model
Before they put bathsalts and all those water bottles in colorado
So get lost, waldo
My soul’s escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole that I’m swallowing this track whole
With a pack torn of paper
But I’m not taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the back pole
And I’m changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go
Trying to dip through the back door retreating cause everybody knows

Skylar Grey:
Everybody knows, that you’re just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don’t pretend to be nice
There’s no place you can hide, you are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Holy mackeral, I’m the biggest jerk on the planet earth
I smack the girl off the mechanical bull, then attract the bull
Thinkin we have some magnetic pull
Screamin icp in this bitch, how do fuckin magnets work!?
Cause you’re attractive, but we ain’t attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I’m not romantical
I’m making up words you can understandable, it’s tragical
Thinkin some magical shit’s gonna happen? That ain’t practical
You crackin a joke, it’s laughable, cause me and love’s like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it’s safe to say I’m uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch you just need a helmet because if you think you’re special
You’re retarded
Thinkin you’re one of a kind, like you got some platinum vagina
You’re a train wreck, I got a one track mind
Shorty you’re fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor
Been tryina, hunt me down like a dog, cause you’re on my ass
But you can’t get a scent because all of my spare time is spent
With my nose in this binder, so don’t bother tryin
Only women that I love are my daughters
And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I’m a father
And I push it farther
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It’s apparent I shouldn’t of been a parent I’ll never grow up
So to hell with your parents, and motherfucking father time
It ain’t never gonna stop
A pessimist who transforms you to optimus in his prime
So even if I’m half dead, I’m half alive
Throw all my half empty glass in a cup, so now my cup is runneth over
And I’m about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster
I’m goin back to what got me here, yeah cocky, and can’t not been? Sude off? so fear not my dear, and dry up your teardrops I’m here
White america’s mirror, so I feel awkward and weird
You stare at me and see yourself, because you’re one too
You shouldn’t be as shocked, because everybody knows”
