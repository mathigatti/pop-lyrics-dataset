I took a course in hallelujah
I went to night school for the blues
I took some stuff they said would cool ya
but nothing seemed to light my fuse
but it's all in the past
like a check that's in the mail
she was a tall whiskey glass
I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail
until I met a blind man
who taught me how to see
a blind man
who could change night into day
and if I can
I'm gonna make you come with me
because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the cloudsaway


I've had some lovers like a joy ride
some things are never what they seem
my heaven's turned into a landslide
I thank God I woke up from the dream
because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds
the way bees chase honey
and drink all the flowers dry
we'll be saving us a little money
and if that don't do it, yeah, I know the reason why
don't make no sense lightin' candles
there's too much moonlight in our eyes
because here comes the sun
ain't no surprise
ain't no doubt about it
gonna open up your eyes
