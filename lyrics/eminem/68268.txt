Guy Talking: I told ya'll mother fuckers I was comin back
(shit) What now nigga what now
What! Prove the projects nigga


Hook:
One Shot, Two Shots, Three Shots, Four Shots
All I hear is gun shot's
This is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor
Music's off party stops
Everybody hit the door somebodys makin shots off

Verse 1(Bizarre):
Securities Gone, I'm dropped in the club
And im tryna run and get my mutha fuckin gun
(nigga what about your wife)
Nigga fuck my wife
Im tryna run, and save my mutha fuckin life
Oh shit, the shooters comin
Bitches hollerin niggas runnin
People shot all over the floor
And im tryna make it to the Saint Andrews door
(Gun shot) Thats the sound of the glock
Even Dj, hoes fucked around and got shot
I dun messed around and forget my tech
I don't see nobody, but the fab five and Dex

Verse Two(Kuniva):
Kuniva you alright?
These niggas is trippin
Where's Bizzare at?
Im tryna flip thru the accident and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin everywhere
And niggas is whilin
Two minutes ago, we was all jokin and smilin
This chick is clingin on to me
Sobbing and sighing
Sayin she didnt mean to diss me earlier,and she cryin
But its real and its on, and caps is gettin peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human sheild
an (oweah) she got hit
now shes yellin 'dont leave me!"
I told her and the dumb bitch belived me
I squeezed through the back door,and made my escape
I ran and got my 38 I hope its not to late

Hook

Verse Three (Kuniva and Swift):
I been tryna call you all day mutha fucker where you at?
I'm on seven mile, what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back
Wit they car?
Wit a gat nigga and my tie flat
An I just hit a pole
Them niggas some hoe's
Is you hit?
I dont know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi
Shit thats the clique we beef wit
Mayn
I swear
And I was on my way there
Belive me im leavin a carcass today
Now ima park my car and walk the rest of the way
Im in the mood to strut
My Ak aint even tucked
Ima meet you at the club we gon fuck these hoes up

Hook

Verse Four (Eminem):
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin outside the door, waitin in lines
Still tryna get in the club, to see D12 perform
The fire marshalls know the vinuews to small
People are wall to wall
Three thousand and some odd fans
And some come wide from out the parking lot
Get to an arguement over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun out and let a few go off
missed you hes aimin for six feet aways the door
into Saint Andrews Hall
Lotta strays flyin all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of em came thru the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar havin a mozeltoff
Bullet wizzed right by my ear
Damn near shot it off
Thank god im alive I gotta find Denauon
And where the fuck is von he usually tucks one on em
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
Naww I guess not
What the fuck? Oh my god it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin ass
I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground pen trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn but I cant pull her
God damn there just went a nother bullet Im hit
My vest is barly able to handle it
Its to thin
If I get hit again, I cant do it I scooped D
Followed Bizzares path, and ran through with it
Made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift
Shootin it out, but I cant see who hes shootin it out with
But Denuans Right behind him squeezing his four fif

Hook

Verse five (Denuan):
Its a friday night came to this bitch right
Big gats to my left Desert eagle in my right
I aint come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight
Although I cant say im here to fight
Cuz im popin niggas tonight
Thats right bitches im drunk with revenge
Shot a ? in the neck for tryna check when I got in
Swift told me to meet him here
So its clear that this mug had shot out the back of a truck
is up in this mother fucker
So one shots for the money
Two's to stop the show
Thirds for the bartender (bitch bring me a shot cold)
I just wanna know whos drivin a black mitsubishi
He tryed to run so proof shot him in the knee wita three piece

Hook
