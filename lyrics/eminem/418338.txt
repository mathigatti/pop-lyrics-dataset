[50 Cent] 
Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy right?
I, I owe you for this one 


CHORUS [50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah!)
You can stun if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
It feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah!)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off you so wrong (It's 50)

[50 Cent] 
I been pacin' in my head
like a baby born dead
Destination heaven
Sittin' poli-tical passengers from nine eleven (Yeah!)
The lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (uh-huh)
Shit I ain't even got to try to shine (woooh)
Gods to seamstress the tailor fitted my pane
I got scriptures in my brain
I can spit at yo' dame
Straight out the good, fuck
Look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man warrior
Swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand write lines
Knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white mans world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut wit' a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends
They know how to pretend

Chorus 2x

[Eminem] 
We been patiently waiting to make it through all the hatin' debatin'
Whether or not you can even weather the storm
Unless you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think they crazy but they ain't crazy let's face it
Shit basically they just playin' sick
They ain't shit they ain't sayin' shit sprayin' 50
A to the K get in the way
I bring Dre and them wit' me
and turn this day into fuckin' mayhem you stayin' wit' me?
Don't let me lose you
I'm not tryin' to confuse you
when I let loose wit' this uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message, am I gettin' through to you?
You know it's comin'
You motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac
and you mix them up in a pot
sprinkle a little Big L on top
what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothin' like survivin' the shot
Y'all know what time it is
Soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats?
'Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was 80 seconds away from the towers
Them cowards fucked wit' the wrong buildin'
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (wooh)
Nuclear showers there's nothin' spookier
You're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50

Chorus

[50 Cent]
The gun squad y'all when the shots go off
It's 50 they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out wit' his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50 man, that boy 50
Don't holla my name

You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
and if you got a glass jaw you should watch yo' mouth
'Cause I'll break yo' face
Have yo ass runnin' mumblin' to the J
You go against me dawg, you makin' a mistake
I'll split you leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets
wit' all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me Skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me Flipper
You a bitch a regular bitch
You callin' up wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food
You keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but, not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, "We don't love them hoes"
I got pennies for my dawgs now I'm rich
See the 20's spinnin' lookin' mean on the 6
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match their clothes
they get caught in the wrong hood
and get filled up wit' holes, motherfucker

Chorus 2x
