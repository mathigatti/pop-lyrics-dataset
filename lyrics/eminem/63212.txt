Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside


Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall, no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating
You waited this long now stop debating 'cause I'm back
I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips, fuck that
Cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie!

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells: Bitch!
A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe for you to see
So damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

Fix your bent antennae, tune it in and then
I'm gonna enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing: Attention, please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me 
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it
I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards, and Moby
You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go, it's over
Nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope
Suspenseful with a pencil ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black Music so selfishly and use it to get myself wealthy
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
