"Purple Hills"
Eminem &amp; D12


[Chorus]
I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

[Eminem]
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of law suits inside her palms
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people
And 5 I hit
Ah shit
I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick
And lost the foster kids
This room makes me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb stuff start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house doing mass amounts
To the women in the thongs with their asses out
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is crashing now
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out

[Kon Artist &amp; Kuniva]
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs wrestling with Elton John
Hey Von, you see me stepping on these leprechauns?
It gotta be Tums the Ex-lax is gone
Yeah I took them all though
with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone
Yo, it's probably numb
Young dumb and full of cum
And I think he's 'bout to swallow his tongue
You scary ass it was a false alarm
Think they're about to die when I just got on
Stop acting stupid
Your so high
That you might wake up with a guy on some new shit
I think I did too much
I think I got the runs
Rolaids, Pepto, and Tums
Watch out HERE it COMES!

[Chorus]
[Hook]
Dirty Dozen
80 of us
Shady brothers
Ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some-, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something i dunno

[Proof]
Ayo, pop pills
Pills I pop
Pop 2 pills
On stilts I walk
Snorted two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was incredible I killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away
Like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
I'm a go for broke
I hope you don't
Pack up my nose with coke
*cough cough cough*
It must have broke the choke
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby
Born by whore lady
Now I'm paying child support
(Its You're baby!)

[Swifty]
I take four shots at one time
I don't need to chase when I'm swallowing mine
(Hey!) You got any room
Bizarre hatch back
We can't go far
Cuz the car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap?
Because my mother taught me
How to breach contracts
If you got cash
then hide it to
(Swift, chill)
I be tryin to get by like you
And i don't give a damn
If u find me rude
Mean, crude
the hell with you too
I only need three blunts and I'm cool
I just got some and I'm going back soon

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
I'm at rave
Looking at a babe
Like she want it
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit
Looney, crazy, chumpy, sexy, dopey headed guy
Whipped cream, dirty mattresses
Wanna try
Blue hills, golden seals
Got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill (Yea right!)
Chick I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty girl
You know you want me in your world
Ladies, please don't fight
Bizarre's here all night!!!

[Chorus]
[Hook]
