[Dr Dre - Verse 1]
My life is like a highlight reel
Some might consider this my twilight but depending how I might feel
I might continue on with my career for 5 light years
Critics can fly kites here?
Welcome to my nightmare
Pressures on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step, pacin?
Don?t know if I?ll meet expectations
All I know is the World better get set
Dre?s in effect
Been in it since you had cassette decks taping
I?m sick?


[Eminem - Hook]
I sit into the wee hours all night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going cause the die hard won?t go down without a fight
?I went to the wee hours all night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going cause the die hard won?t go down without a fight

[Dr Dre - Verse 2]
It?s on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations
They're soaring too high to meet, my reputations in jep?
Yep, face it, the fans they?ve been upset yet patient, I love ?em for that

[Hook]
I sit into the wee hours all night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going cause the die hard won?t go down without a fight
?I went to the wee hours all night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going cause the die hard won?t go down without a fight

[Develdiii]
