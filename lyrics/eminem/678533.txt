[ Intro - Eminem ]
You still love me?
Take this
You ready?
1 - 2 - THREE!
*BANG, BANG*


[ Ritornello 1 - Eminem ]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me,
the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more

[ Verso 1 - Eminem ]
It's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit
We say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it for us
It's lust, 'cuz neither one of us trusts each other so we fuck
'till we bust, 'till cuss each other out, we know what it's about
Shout 'till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth, we fist fight
'till we turn this mother out and apologize after, laughter
Pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you
There ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do 'cuz

[ Ritornello 1 - Eminem ]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me,
the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more

[ Verso 2 - Eminem ]
'Cuz I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cuz you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You FUCK other people and I FUCK other people
You're a SLUT, but i'm equal, i'm a MUTT, we're both evil
in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cuz one of us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumours
But they ain't got proof, 'till they do, it's just the two of us
You and me, 'cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me
But you gotta believe it to a degree 'cuz true indeed
If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin', yeah I would
'Cuz the sex is too damn good, if I ran, who would I run to?
It would be this soft and ???, so it's off and on
Usually more off then on but at least we know that we
Share this common bond, you're the only one I can fuck
without a condom on, I hope the only reason that I cope
Is 'cuz if that faggot busts then
I can bust in that, and that's why

[ Ritornello 1 - Eminem ]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me,
the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more

[ Verso 3 - Eminem ]
I can never understand it,
that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die,
you silly hoe why must we try
Is it really so rough that we must always
call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
We're lying to ourself, that's the beauty of it, yeah
'Cuz we truly love each other, that's why we always fight
And all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear, it ain't gonna change, this pinned up rage
We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we both been
someone else's someone else
The problem is neither one
wants help, it's an addiction
And it can't be fixed, our family's mixed up
There's a baby sister in the mix and it hurts
'cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks
he knows us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired
of hearing it all the time on every song
Every lyric and every rhyme,
all the hoopla, all of the woopty woo
What you put me through, fuckin' woopty do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time,
you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cuz this time girl i'm tellin you what
You do it again and i'm fuckin' you up 'cuz no matter

[ Ritornello 2 - Eminem ]
What you say, what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'till I find you
No matter where you run, i'll be right there
Right behind you in your nightmares
So much for them flowers, and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you 'gon hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me, whore

[ Ritornello 1 - Eminem ]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more
