Wake up, the house is on fire
And the cat's caught in the dryer
philosophy's a liar when
your home is your headstone
"Icon" is the last chance for hope
When there's no such things as heroes 
Your faith lies in the ditch that
you dug yourself in


Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down

Deabeat holidday-celebrate your own decay
there's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home

Deadbeat holiday-get on your knees and pray
there's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

Christmas lights in the middle of August
grudges come back to haunt us
your oldest allies are your long lost enemies
Grounded in a duplex to find that
You're living on a landmine
Vacation hotspots is a cemitery drive

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down

Deabeat holidday-celebrate your own decay
there's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home

Deadbeat holiday-get on your knees and pray
there's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay when all you
want to do is...not to...give up...
