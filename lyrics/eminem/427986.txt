No more upset mornings 
No more trying evenings 
It's the American Dream I am disbelieving. 
When the gas in my tank feels like money in the bank 
I'm gonna blow it all this time, take me one last ride. 
The lights of the city, they only look good when I'm speeding 
I wanna leave em all behind me because this time I'm gone 
Gone, going for it all this time, gone. 
In the far off distance 
As my taillights fade 
No one to witness but they will someday 
Feel like a question is forming 
And the answers
I will be what I could be 
Once I get out of this town. 
The lights of this city 
They've lost all of their feeling 
I wanna leave em all behind me because this time I'm gone 
Gone, going for it all, this time I'm gone 
Nothing is everything 
I'll have it all 
If nothing is everything then I will have it all. 
I'm gone.
