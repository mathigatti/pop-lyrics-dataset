Say Goodbye Hollywood

Chorus (X2)
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood


Verse 1
I thought I had it all figured out, I did, I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough, to juggle two things at once, I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave. How come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt, knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me, the minute shit was heated, she just bailed, I'm standin' here swingin' like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell, turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground, I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female, I need to slow down, get my feet on solid ground/so for now I'm...

Chorus (X2)

Verse 2
I, bury my face in comic books, cus I don't want to look at nothin', this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would, and end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are piling all at once, cuz everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up, I gotta get up, thank God, I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good, I'd be to my daughter, layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood cus I don't know how I do it, all I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps
Of my dad, cus I hate him so bad, the worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am, what do I say to my fans/when I tell 'em (I'm)...

Chorus (X2)

Verse 3
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it, for me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick,publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at Gats, if I scrap,I'll scrap like I ain't never whupped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact, I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at, this is wack,this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask, what about math,how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back, I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein', everything blow up and all you did was just grow up mcing
It's fuckin' crazy, cus all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had, but instead I forced us to live alienated
So I'm sayin'...

Outro
Goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood (Goodbye)
Please don't cry for me (It's been real)
When I'm gone for good (This shit is not for me)
Goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood (I'm not a fuckin' star)
Please don't cry for me (No way)
When I'm gone for good (I'm goin' back home)
