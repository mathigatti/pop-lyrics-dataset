I've had my troubles and i've had my trials, sometimes i wondered
if
I would make it one more mile but he left a promise and i
believe oh
why should i worry with the sinful world im getting ready to
leave.


Ch-He's coming back, and i'm going home, soon im gonna see the 
Face of the one ive waited for so long one of these mornings you
look
for me and ill be gone, cause hes coming back, and im going
home.

2- The coming of jesus would not be so dear, if i knew that when
he 
came back i would have to stay down here oh but he is preparing
a 
mansion just for me and i am gonna live in that heavenly home
through
out eternity

repeat ch2x
