(INTRO)
Yo
same song and dance
damn girl everywhere i go
same song and dance
i like the way you move all over the globe
same song and dance
there's something about it man
same song and dance
in the pale moonlight


(VERSE ONE)

I'm looking at you yeah girl you're kinda tooken back by
the whole rapper thing aren't ya?
probably think you'll get slapped so damn hard ya
wont even be able stand up straight aren't ya?
a couple rape charges people think you're a monster
the police constantly buggin you non-stop
i walk up on you, well hello tonya!
i think you got your ??? button inside your car stuck
you outta gas, do you got a flat?
i would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
i got your back, why dont you put your laundry basket in the back?
and sit up front, im not asking, its a trap
you just got jacked and bodysnatched and it's a wrap
in broad day - no masks for this attack
i heard them say exact opposites attract
if that's fact it'll take taskforce to get you back

(HOOK)
Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't ever gonna break that glass, the windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all, look at you ball, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance.

(VERSE TWO)
The first victim i had, she was a big one
big movie star, party girl, big fun
she was the girl the media always picked on
in and out of rehab every 4-6 months
she was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
on nickelodeon flashed to little kids once
what an event it was, i was sitting in front
i was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
seen her backstage, now here's where i come in son
look her she comes i'd better put out the big guns
"hello lindsay you're looking a little thin, hun'
how about a ride to rehab? get in cunt!
starting off on the wrong foot is what i didn't want
girl im just kidding let me start over again, hun
see what i meant was we should have a little intervention
come with me to brighton, let me relieve your tension
you little wencher, murder wasn't my intention
if i wanted to kill you it would have already been done
slowly she gets in and i begin to lynch her with 66 inches of extension chord

(HOOK)
Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't ever gonna break that glass, the windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all, look at you ball, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance.

(VERSE THREE)
My second victim was even bigger than the first
pop star, icon, the whole works
she played a little schoolgirl when she first
burst upon the scene and seen the world was hers
she twirls and turns and flirts and skirts so bad it hurts
it irked me and made me mad at first
i lashed out in my songs
but what was really going on was that i had developed a crush, i just didn't know how to tell it to her
should i cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
send her pictures of my collections of skeletons or
footage of me impaling myself on an elephant's tusk?
we'll settle this once and for all, ima tell her at dusk
tonight, tonight its the night, and tell her i must
creep upto her mansion in stilhettos and just
climb the gate and ring the bell, like "hello my love"
i just picked your prescription for ceriquill up
now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
i'll share my valium with you cos im feeling you britney
i'll trade you a blue one for a pink one ever since at schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
i've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little girl
you hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
come on toots give me the valium, i'll slamdunk it in your mouth till you puke
and just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
im about to make a new outfit outta you
a new outfit? shit i'll make a new suit outta your shoe
now show me how you move girl, do how you do

(HOOK)
Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't ever gonna break that glass, the windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all, look at you ball, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance.

Same kickin' and screamin', same prayin' and sobbin'
Same song and dance, same beggin' and pleadin'
Same yellin' and bleedin', same song and dance
Yeah same song and dance, I know... Same song and dance
