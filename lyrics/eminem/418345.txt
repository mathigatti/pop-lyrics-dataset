Skylar Montgomery? 
What do you want from me Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear
Veronica!
Wait a minute, you hold hold it right there.  Me
and that woman 
love each other.
Love? What do you know of love?
We were destined to be together.  I met her on the
beach...!
Are you out to destroy me?
No Roger.  That's not what I want to do.
I love her!  And were going to be together.
