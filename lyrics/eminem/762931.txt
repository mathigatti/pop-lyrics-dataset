Yo! Turn that click offâ€¦

My music is soothing
But its also been provin
That it can put you in the mood to 
jump out your car while it's movin
You been waitin' on this moment
My sermon is like a omen
I'm servin' I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open 
And I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book
Go ahead and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it
Rummage,and find something
you can use to jump someone
And roll up bumpin
I'm constantly copin' over you
Squattin', shit has gotten to the point
Where I ain't even writin' no more, I'm just jottin'
This is chicken scratch, shit is sickenin'
I've been kickin' ass off bullshit
Throwaway rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap, you crazy
Ive made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat, you Cannabis
Then it's Dre's fee, you Kay Slay the fees waved
I stay beefin' with JD, till the day Dre 2-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazin' him
Oops! I put it out, I apologize now
It's too late G, it's on tape
And the tape leaped, "Say What You Say" mothafucka
Drama King, Kay Slay, mothafucka, We dictate these mixtapes mothafucka
Xzibit blaze little gay midget cocksucka
