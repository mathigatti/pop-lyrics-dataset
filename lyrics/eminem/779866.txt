Old Hip Hop musical beat tune plays in the
background, just like a radio 
station&gt;


Proof (From D12):
Yeah soul it tick, checking it number 1 baby this
week,
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is M.C. Proof

Hare:
And D.J. Hare.

Proof (From D12):
Checkin' in on W.E.G.O.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ay yo we got the number 1 requested song, of the DAY

It's a local thing wants retilin'
It goes by the name of Eminem
