I got a riddle what's little and talks big 
with midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle
that will do anything to throw dirt on my name 
if it means walkin the whole Mediterranean
isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
it's Dave, Raymond, and oh, Osario. so sorry woah
but that was a long time ago when I was just joe shmoe
rappin in joe blows basement I apologized for it befo, so
either except it or you don't and lets move on 
if I've shown that I've grown and get the bone 
keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts 
keep walkin around sniffin each others butts
or should I say asses 
what would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

I got a riddle what's little and talks big
with midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle
that will do anything to throw dirt on my name 
if it means walkin the whole Mediterranean
isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
his name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry wow
but that was a long time ago when I was just joe shmoe
rappin in joe blows basement I apologized for it befo so
either except it or you don't and lets move on 
if I've shown that I've grown and get the bone 
keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts 
keep walkin around sniffin each others butts 
or should I say asses 
what would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses
the question I ask is 
how can I explain this 
how can I swing this in English language 
if I switch to slang and turn man to man 
do I do it in vain or simply to entertain 
am I bein real or am I bein fake 
am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine 
or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter 
I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya 
I'm tell ya one me (a)gain this is the environment that I was brought up in 
but every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration 
or should I say or should I say shun 
is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism 
your face is numb your stunned your look is cold 
like that of a man of seventy some years old 
and it only gets colder which Is why I understand 
and cant be mad at a forty four year old fan 
with a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine 
and the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again 
only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown 
papa cant stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down 
in his new chair that goes round and round 
that he bought from new money in his bank account 
that I get him every issue when the thang comes out 
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out 
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side 
yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide 
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride 
but aint nobody over here buyin two white guys disguised as pro black
there is no slack 
far heart for college grat. In a fitted hat and a hunch back 
standin by the clearance coat rack 
in some old slacks and some R.S.O throwbacks
shady in the place to be c 
and it takes what I got to rock the mic right 
still not gonna cater these punks 
fuckin cocksuckin pussy lips haters dicks cunts
