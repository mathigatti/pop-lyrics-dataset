Eminem - Deja-Vu

( Verse1 ) 
As i fall deeper into a manic state 
Im a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits 
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate 
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of night quil then i salivate 
Start off with the night quil like i think i'll just have a taste 
Couple sips of that then i gradually graduate 
Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great 
I go to take just one and i end up like having eight 
Now i need something in my stomach cuz i haven't ate 
Maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak 
And you'd think with all i have at stake 
Look at my daughters face.... 
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad i think 
He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me 
Wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me 
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos 
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat 


( Hook ) 
Sometimes i feel so alone, 
I just dont know, feels like i been down this road before, 
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me, 
Soon as i go home and close the door, 
kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place i do, 
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont 
and why i just dont know..... 


( Verse2 ) 
Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer 
Thats the devil in my ear i been sober a fuckin year 
And that fucker still talks to me he is all i can fuckin hear 
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers 
And maybe if i just drink half i'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time 
Who's that mastermind behind that little line 
With that kind of rational man i got half a mind 
Too have another half of glass of wine sound acinine 
Ya i know 
But i never had no problem with alcohol 
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch im about to fall 
I missed the couch and down i go looking like a bouncing ball 
Shit must have knocked me out cuz i aint feel the ground at all 
Wow what the fuck happend last night where am i 
Man fuck am i hungover and god damn i got a head ache 
Shit half a vicodin why cant i ? 
" All systems ready for take off please stand by "

( Verse3 ) 
So i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh 
A couple weeks go by it aint even like im getting high 
now i need it just not to feel sick ya im getting by 
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die 
Oh ya theres an excuse you lose proof so you use 
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through 
It's twelve noon aint no harm in self inducing a snooze 
What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes 
now here i am 3 months later full blown relapse 
Just get high untill the kids get home from two homes relax 
And since im convinced that im in-somniac 
I need these pills to be able to sleep so i take 3 naps 
Just to be able to function throughout the day lets see 
That's an ambian each nap how many valium 3 
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep 
Ok so now you see the reason how come he 
Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b 
See me and you we almost had the same outcome he 
Cuz that christmas you know the nomonia thing 
It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think 
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos 
your vcr tape cases with you ambian cr great places to hide aint it 
So you can lie to hailie im going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina 
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance 
They said they found me on the bathroom floor
