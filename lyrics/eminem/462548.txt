[Eminem]
If I'm elected for ten terms
I'm renewing the staff after the inaugural
And hiring all girls as interns
If I don't like you, I'll snatch you outta your mic booth
While you're rappin' and pull you right through the window and fight you
I'll take you straight to the pavement
Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit' a bracelet
Like a razor that shaved it
Three drinks and I'm ready to flash
Runnin' on stage in a G-string, wit' a bee sting on my ass (Look!)
It's probably all 'cause I ain't awkward at all
I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and talk to the wall
And have a relapse after I just fought through withdrawal
(Hop in the car little girl, I just bought you a doll)
The Bad and Evil movement is comin'
Plus the music is pumpin' like a pill freak wit' a tube in his stomach
I write a rhyme a day
So it's no wonder how come your whole album
Is soundin' like a bunch of shit that I would say
Whether it's one verse or one letter
I'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever
It's Slim Shady and Tony Touch, it's only us
The rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle wit' Monie Love
