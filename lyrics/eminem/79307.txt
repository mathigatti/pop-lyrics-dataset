I'm decimating the competition 
With my fucked up rendition
Of this muthafucking song
It's my traditionI fucked up Limp Bizkit
With my own slip disks
And the fucking bastards 
Just came and dissed my districtI ain't have to diss people
To get my career started
You muthafucking assholes 
Fuck everything and pass it
Knew I was special from
My first demo tape
My first hit moved straight on
To my first hate
And my first date 
Was as fucked up as it gets
Passed the test
But the bitch didn't want to get wet
So I killed my guinea pig 
Just to up and spite her
My fucking bitch of a mom
Screamed and said I didn't like herI'm decimating the competion
With my fucked up rendition
Of this fucking song 
It's my traditionI fucked up Limp Bizkit
With my own slip disks
And the fucking bastards 
Just came and dissed my districtYo freestyle for all you muthafuckas
Eminem 1999
It feels so good to be back
