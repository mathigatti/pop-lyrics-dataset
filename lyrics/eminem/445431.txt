Light green to green, dark green, brown
every life is falling down 
brown to black, its coming back
dies to be part of the ground 
seed to seedling, root to stem 
eyes, no eyes, there's no difference 
every life is looking in 
swallowing seeds on my death bed 
dig a hole in the garden 
everyone is practicing 
but this world's an accident 
i was the fool because i thought 
i thought the world 
turns out the world thought me 
its all the other way 'round 
we're upside down 
daddy's gone up in flames 
but this ain't no movie 
this ain't no book you can close 
when the big lie hits your eye 
everyone is practicing 
our world's an accident 
i was the fool because i thought 
i thought the world 
turns out the world thought me 
its all the other way 'round 
we're upside down 
down, down, down...
let the fluency set it down
let the fluency set it down
there's an upside of down 
the moon is rolling 'round the world 
the moon is rolling 'round the world 
the world
our world...
