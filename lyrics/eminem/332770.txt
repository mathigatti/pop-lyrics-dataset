Hey yo dawg
I got some shit on my motherfuckin chest that
I need to get off cause, if I don't
I'ma fuckin explode, or somethin
Now look - this is a story about
some little fuckin girls that I know
It goes like this..


It's so easy for me to make enemies any more it's sickening
People are lookin for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that, I don't wanna be in - shit
I never had no beef with your corny son of a bitches
But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin to fix it
So I'm tellin you right now - motherFUCK a Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real, B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin, see
he chill
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin cypherin name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin and
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentionin me
That little fuckin weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talkin bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song
Talkin bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
What's wrong? You scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him
too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin sissy, up on stage, screamin how people hate you
They don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And how dare you motherfuckers that try to diss me back
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin my ass
Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song I'm tryin to
pre-warn you
Lethal when I fuckin see you dawg I'm swingin on you!
Motherfuckers must think cause I'm in trouble with the law
that I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow

[Chorus]
Y'all some - girrrrls - y'all are some god damn girls
Why do you act this way? - Why do you act this way huh?
Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies you pussies
keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that
And we all knowwww - we all know, hah
How fuckin cowards rollll - "keep rollin rollin
rollin"
In-fuckin-dent me's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow dowwwn

[Eminem]
Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my
beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
and I won't put you in 'em
Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my
beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask



is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
and I won't put you in 'em

Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
and I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dogs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
in my coffin I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again no (nope)
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin off me
I'm not bein cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger (hey!)
I say "Fuck Christina" he says "Fuck
Christina" but meaner
So from doin a song with Method to beggin to get accepted
I'm peggin Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head
with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin you up punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin
And fuck BIZKIT! Cause I know you're sayin fuck D-12
Only not to our face, under your breath, to yourselves

[Chorus]
You little - girrrrls - motherfuckin females
Why do you act this way? - Why do y'all act this way huh?
Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies you pussies
keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that
And we all knowwww - now we all know the truth
How fuckin cowards rollll - "keep rollin rollin
rollin"
In-fuckin-dent me's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow dowwwn

[Eminem]
Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my
beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
and I won't put you in 'em
Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my
beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
and I won't put you in it

And that's it, that's all there is to it dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin song
don't say you're down with doin the fuckin song
and then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin MTV talkin about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog
just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin song myself
and not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin-you-up shit when I see you
And I will see you too; oh, and by the way Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
