Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure


Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
Nobody is perfect and I'm stand accused
For lack of a better word, that's my best excuse
