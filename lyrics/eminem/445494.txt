Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night
It's only right
Ta think about the girl you love,
And hold her tight.
So happy together
If I should call you up
Invest a dime
And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind
Imagine how the world would be
So very fine
So happy together


I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

Me and you
And you and me
No matter how they toss the dice
It has to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together

If I should call you up
Invest a dime (A dimeee)
And you say you belong to me
And you are mine (aree minee)
Imagine how the world could be
So very fine (Very Fineeee)

So happy together

I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

For all my life....

Call you up
Ease my mind
Ease my mind
Ease my mind

I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

So happy together (x4)
