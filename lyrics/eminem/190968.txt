Slim mother fuckin shady....alright
Missy elliot, timbo, c'mon, yo


Verse 1:

I'm homicidal, and suicidal, with no friends
Holdin a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin techs at you
Untill u see the fuckin legs full of bullets holes and the exit wounds layin next to you.
Fuckin mad dog, foamin out the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin out the couch
Jumped outta a 93 floor of a buildin
And shot every window out on the way to the ground(keep filmin)
Woke up to a hospital staff
Got up and laughed
Chopped em in half
And sufficated your oxygen mask
If i get any higher ima get the east and west beefin again
Fly back to detroit and stand in the cross-fire

(ken kaniff's voice) oh fuck...oh shit
I got the ?? ready
What time are you gettin off.....work
Or shall i say
What time are you comin over

Verse 2:

Yo, yo, im only smilin when im violent,
Got on the plane wylin,
Told the piolet to fly me to tylenol island
Stewardess like "you restless?"
"no bitch, im rest-full, so hold this fuckin jet still so i can eat this pretzels"
Forget school,
The other kids are disrespectfull,
They hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles
I can't take it
I'm tryin to gain weight,
So i eat steak
And swallow the whole plate
And weigh myself, naked
Without albulms
To teach kids family values
Cuz every mom and dad should allo you to pop vaiulums
And never hit sum 1 unless you got a reason
And if there ain't a reason
Make 1 up and just start swingin
