Ecstasy....in the air
I don't care, can't tell me nothing
I'm impared, the worst for wear
Cause...


I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb...

Can't you say....
Ain't it clear, I don't care
Get closer to me...
If you dare
I double dare
Cause...

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb...

I'm class, look me in my eyeball
Do I look hot? no..
I love the way you lie girl, yeah, yeah
Come here dear, i'm trying to get closer to you
I'm motioning you to pull over you boo
On the side that you're here, here
I'm the butt police, and i'm looking at you
But I talk, i'm an ing dumped in the back of a squad car
But I ain't got tonight
I'm a rock star, get your wing up
It's attack at a yacht bar
Homie king yeah show me where guy's done
Pass i'll talk cause i'm sick of steady ask for
Every thought's cut, now my pants off
Let the cross walk, it's a slinger
And I cant feel my limbs

Cause...

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going
