dear *marshall*, 
dear *marshall*, 
i just wanna start out by saying 
i still love you 


even when i was pregnant with you 
it was very hard for me 
so many times of torture was worth every minute of it 
cuz wen i looked in to those big blue eyes 
this was the first time i had ever felt true love 
in my whole life 

we have a problem marshall 
the past 2 years..something really went wrong 

i was so excited about your success yet so let down by your 
betrayal 
playing the role of both mum &amp; dad must of taken a toll on you 
more then i ever imagined 
*marshall* i did the best i could 
i went without seeking half 
it was rong of me and i see it now as giving you everything 
and never questioning ne thing you eva did 
as you were perfect in my eyes 
my unconditional love created a spoiled young man 
an angry one too 
now before god and every1 i must apologise cuz at the time 
i thought it was the right thing to do 
im torchered daily *marshall* by people always asking me where 
such an angry young man .................... 
being the only role model in your life, of course they're gonna 
blame me 
the demeanin me needs to stop and i speak 4 lots of mothers 
the words really hurt and they cut like a knife 
but theres no way to mend a bleedin heart 
if not 4my frenz who ave been there for me and yes 
*marshall* they really truely care 
i pray some day your not going to be alone and you'll ave frenz like 
me.....and they wont be there just for your fame 
and no more attacks on me 
and vicious acts of heat cuz it really hurts 
will the real marshall mathers please stand up? 
and take responsibility 4his actions 
and im gonna close this *marsh* by saying 
its not too late for change 
and always sincerely your only mother
