[Intro - Eminem]
Ohhh!!
Ladies and gentlemen!
The moment you've all been waiting for!
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds,
The record of 17 rapes,
400 assaults &amp; 4 murders,
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world!
Slim Shady!


[Chorus - Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto.
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe,
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves,
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us,
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust,
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk,

[Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen...Dr. Dre!

[Verse 1 - Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by there, like "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why,
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA,
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day,
And this one begins where the last one ends,
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again,
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz,
Driving around with a smashed front end,
Let's cash that one in,
Grab another one from out the stable,
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado,
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions. Garage looks like precision collision,
Or Maico beats quake like Waco,
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though.

[Chorus - Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto.
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe,
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves,
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us,
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust,
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk,

[Verse 2 - Eminem]
Back with Andre The Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk,
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust,
Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus,
Kiss my butt, lick my under cheese from under my nuts,
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks,
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed,
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cut,
Missed the cut, the lady give a (?) some paper cut,
Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought,
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse and worse cause your soft,
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time,
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes,
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room,
I venture to say with the same repetition is true,
Not to mention back with a vengeance and hit the signal,
Of the bat symbol. The platinum dude is back on you hoes.

[Chorus - Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto.
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe,
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves,
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us,
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust,
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk,

[Verse 3 - Dr. Dre]
It's sorta like pourin' Draino down a live volcano,
You never know what'll happen next, it may blow,
Same thing happens to the beats when Dre blows,
I talk shit, but my dick's long as my payroll,
I get ass like a ball player, but I'm a boss player,
Pimping hoes from here to Australia,
Till I get heart failure,
Look at ya half of ya'll, all scared,
Other half, hands up in the air, like "Awww yeah."
This is our year, this is what you call sheer-
talent, but I think at this point it's just obvious,
Fears, they say my music's good for all queers,
Cuz I make your ear ring bitch. Ears and all queers,
Call us the mafia, we got the fucking mob here,
Gimme the hate and I'll feed off of ya's all year,
Shit, I'm just doing my job here, you don't want problem, do ya?
Fuck it, I'll even crack a bottle for ya.

[Chorus - Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto.
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe,
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves,
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us,
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust,
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk.
