Back when Cain was able
Way before the stable
Lighting struck right down from the sky
A mother ship with fate said let's give it a tryConscience was related
Man he was created
Lady luck took him by surprise
A sweet and bitter fruit it surely opened his eyesWell she ate it
Lordy it was love at first bite
Well she ate it
Never knowin wrong from right right rightEven Eve in Eden
Voices tried deceiving
With lies that showed the lady the way
At first she stopped and turned and tried to walk awayMan he was believer
Lady was deceiver
So the story goes but you see
The snake was he and she just climbed right up his treeSo she ate it
Lordy it was love at first bite
Well she ate it
Never knowin wrong from right right rightWhooooaaa......Conscience was related
Man he was created
When lady luck took him by surprise
The sweet and bitter fruit it surely opened his eyesEvil came like reignin
Who knows who's to blamin
Something tried to lay her to waste
And all she want and need was just a little tasteWhooa, she ate it
Lordy it was love at first bite
Well she ate it
Never knowin wrong from right right rightWell she ate it
Lordy it was love at first bite
Yeah she ate it
Never knowin wrong from right right Oh that's right
