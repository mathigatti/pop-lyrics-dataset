I never loved.. uh never loved like i love u(2x)OH,
I don't think i've ever loved somebody the way i love u
The words are unexplanable 
All i could say is i love u
And u will always be in my heart.. (uh, huh uh)
Its like that poem;(yea)
"Roses are red, violets are blue
But nothing is stronger than my love for u"
ah, what do I do, uh. u say u love
I love u too
but if u do, whyd u go break my heart the way u did ?I never loved, 
I never somebody the way I love u
I love uuuu
