Yo, yoâ€¦
Your style is generic, 
mines authentic made,
I roll like a renegade, 
you need clinic aid,
My techniques bizarre and ill, 
I scar and kill,
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill,
And I proceed to cook and grill ya,
That's all it took to kill ya,
You betta recognize me like I look familiar,
You wanna battle? 
You beat around the bush,
Like you're scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush,
I need a clown to push, 
someone that I can bully,
Wait a minute, 
I don't think you understand fully,
See me without a style like mustard without the Heinz,
I lead the new school, 
you' re a 'busta without the 'rhymes',
I'll crush the shit out ya lines,


no nigga sheky
smokin the leak leaky
ten freaky girsl 
inside the Chin Tiki
girl when u see me u gots to believe me
this aint a game n
pimp it aint easy
anything goes when it comes to hoes
im the kingpin when it comes to flows
u betta ask someone if u dont know
when u see me girl say, "What up dog''
