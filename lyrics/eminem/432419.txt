What is there left for me to do in this life
Did I achieve what I had set in my sights
Am I a happy man or is this sinking sand
Was it all worth it was it all worth it


Yeah now hear my story let me tell you about it
We bought a drum kit blew my own trumpet
Played the circuit thought we were perfect
Was it all worth it
Giving all my heart and soul and staying up all night
Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock'n'roll a godforsaken life
Was it all worth it was it all worth it all these years

Put down our money without counting the cost
It didn't matter if we won if we lost
Yes we were vicious yes we could kill
Yes we were hungry yes we were brill
We served a purpose like a bloody circus
We were so dandy we love you madly

Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock'n'roll this godforsaken life
Was it all worth it was it all worth it
When the hurly burly's done

We went to bali saw God and dali
So mystic surrealistic
Was it all worth it yeah yeah
Giving all my heart and soul staying up all night
Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock'n'roll this never ending fight
Was it all worth it was it all worth it
Yes it was a worthwhile experience

It was worth it
