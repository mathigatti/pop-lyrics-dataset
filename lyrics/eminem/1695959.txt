(Intro:)
I don't now man, just feels like, well a lot different
Kinda feels like, I'm on a whole different page right now
Feels strange but um, I guess it's kinda like... it's kinda like


(Verse 1:)
I feel like I'm morphin, into something so incredible, that I'm dwarfin'
All competetors, better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphin side-effect
Your self esteem shatters his dialect
Comes blasting out your deck, she loves me
So much passion you'd expect this sort reaction from her yet
You're strong oh, you're fucking corny, you try to turn your charm on
Cause you just think you're Bishop the don one
But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like 'Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like "she's fucking with dude, she wants some"
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do? How you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closing her eyes, fantasizing
Of digging her nails in my back to this track

(Hook:)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you


Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

(Verse 2:)
She's sitting there getting liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc, CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not, aw
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhyming one syllable, nah
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
Cause they're just not good enough
But I'm not giving up til I get my respect
And I won't stop til I get enough
Cause I'm not living up to my own expectations, aw
That hater alarm is sounding off
And Obama took the bomb from my name, aw
So quit crying that I took your dame
Homie she's my dame, aw
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came for it
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault
Man I can't call it

(Hook:)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

(Verse 3:)
It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker
Dear, while I freak this world premier
Seducing her, loosen up with a little freestyle
Wait, am I losing ya? Am I making you look bad?
Well I got news for ya homie, you're losing her
Oh wait she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryna show how, let me slow it down
It's still gonna be a blowout
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something
To see if you can save any of it punk
But none of it's fucking with me
Prick you really feeling that bullshit?
You think you killing them syllables? quit playing
These beats ain't nothing to fool with
They call me fire Marshall, I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome, and you are just awe-struck
She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From sucking my dick, awwfuck

(Hook:)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
