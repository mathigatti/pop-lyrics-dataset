[Dr. Dre]
Yeah
Yo let's bring it 


CHORUS [Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man
Will you be as hard as you say you are
Are you gonna run and go get your bodyguard
I said what you gonna do when shit hits the fan
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man
And show us you're as hard as you say you are
Are you gonna run and go get your bodyguard

[Dr. Dre]
Niggas is so gangster, niggas is thugs
Niggas'll spend they whole life peddling drugs
Slanging dope, in hopes of one day
being able to own their own label and give the game up
Some niggas came up, some just didn't
It's just the way is
if it ain't minute just isn't?
Some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back 'em
So they can act up
feel comfortable and rap tough and that's ass backwards
'cause them niggas is just gon' keep comin' back
and that's when extortion happens
It's a struggle to get free
I know how that shit be
You give anything that look legitimately
But you gon' find if you do get in this industry
it's best to do business with me then against me
Niggas get behind mics and ain't even emcees
Niggas get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughing all the way to the bank
watching you saddle life in my Bentley
You niggas ain't even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
I tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissin'
I don't even listen to ya shit to know who the fuck I'm dissin'
And media just feeds into these feuds
trying to add fuel to the fire
This little nigga Ja Rule talking about he's gonna slap me
Nigga please, you gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview 'em
all they doing is making fake threats to us through 'em
Ya pussy you not Pac I knew 'em
Pac was a real nigga, you just a fuckin' insult to him
it's too bad we had a fall out before he passed
'cause if he could he see this shit now, he'd be whoopin' your ass
You're talkin' to a pioneer who engineered this shit for nineteen years
Who ya got in ya ears? (Suge)
I ain't even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit trying to be tough nigga, you look like a asshole

Chorus

[Obie Trice]
They say why don't we increase the peace
The only piece to crease is that which deletes ya peeps
'cause niggas run mouths but they don't want streets
till that 4-5 decease ya speech
Yeah it's a shame how the beef'll creep
coulda reached a peak
now ya left with a horrible leap
I'm trying to be as bleep with my speech as possible
just in case a nigga try to throw me an obstacle
Nigga I'm not boxing you
I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital that's how I get at you
Let the doc op' on you he don't rid you
You back on them streets
I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition ya tissue
Give a fuck if you bring all ten of them wit' you
I throw a extra ten of them missiles
turn gangstas into gentleman fickle
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the woman and bitch in you
all this bickering back and forth over who signs who
Curtis pull ya skirt up ya got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off, damn!
And quit telling all these magazines ya plans
How you gonna slap up my man, ya fictious
Nigga we'll send Stan to come murder ya bitches

Chorus

[Obie Trice]
Hahahahahaha
Yeah! Go out and buy all the gangstas you want nigga
Matter of fact
Go get every gangster from every hood in the United States of America to back you nigga
Ain't nobody riding with you
You can't see that?
You fell off nigga! (Hahahaha)
Damn!
Shady slash Aftermath mothafucka
2003 to infin', yeah!!
