Now everybody from the 313
Put your mothefucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313
Put your mothefucking hands up
Look Look


Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not had his hands up
This free world got you gased up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf

1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1 pac, 2 pac, 3 pac, 4
4 pac, 3 pac, 2 pac, 1
You're pac, he's pac, no pacs, none

This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,
I know everything he's got to say against me,
I am white, I am a fuckin bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom,
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob who shoots
himself in the leg with his own gun,
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl,
I'm still standin here screamin "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
Don't ever try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck i've been through

But i know something about you
You went to Crankbook, that's a private school
What's the matter dawg? You embarrased?
This is guy's a gangster, he's real name's Clarence

And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, He's shook
'Cause there no such things as half-way crooks
He's scared to death
He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook, fuck Crankbook

Fuck the beat, i go acapella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty,
Here, tell this people something they dont know about me.
