(When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down)
This is what it sounds like when I'm breakin' it down
(Yeah I'm breakin' it down)
Man this is what it feels like, when I'm breakin' it down
(When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down)
It's not my fault
It's not fault (I'm hot man!)
It's not my fault
It's not my fault


Till the sun comes up, every night
We party and we party 'til daylight
We be gettin' it in come on we gettin' it in
A lil' Hennessey, a lil' juice and gin
It's not a fantasy, it's not pretend
We gon' do it, we gon' do it, we gon' do it again
Till the sun comes up, every night
We party and we party 'til daylight

I shouldn't have to tell you shorty you should know
I'm really been lookin' into yo' freak show
You gimme a little baby and I'ma want mo'
O.D.B. said that I like it raaaw!
Exotic her body been movin' on the flo'
Enough to make a ***** lose control
I'm down to go wherever you wan' go
Ya got a man now keep it on the low
I do my thing you know I gets my dough
I got a few stacks me and you can blow
We get into the hotel after the show
I know how to romance ya, be my private dancer, yeah

On ya mark, get set girl, now here we go
Racin' off to see yo' peep show
It turn me on to see you on the flo'
When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down
Ready or not shorty now here I come
Shake that thing girl now back it up
Work it, work it, girl you turn me on
When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down

They say I'm not the same it's 'cause I'm filthy mayne
I'm off the chain I don't play no games
I'm hustlin' hard homie I do my thang
You fuck wit' the paper then watch the hammer go bang
Now shorty I like the way she move them hips
I'm tryna get her in my bedroom and shit
We can take a long time or get it done quick
We can camcord the shit make a boom-boom flick
It's oh so many places that we can go
I really want you shorty shorty now you should know
Girl ya body's callin' me hear you loud and clear
We ain't got to leave now we can do it right here

The way you move (the way you move)
You make me lose (you make me lose)
All control (all control)
I know you know (I know you know)
You're so seductive, you make me wanna touch it
I ain't got to tell ya, you know I wanna fuck ya
I'm feelin' your style ya better watch me now
My tongue'll be in ya mouth my hands'll be in ya blouse
When you get me aroused you put a spell on me
Man if I can't have ya I'ma go crazy
I want you bad now and if you want me
Girl come to me now, I said come to me now

Come to me now? You gon' come to me now?
Apple in ya mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about
Twenty minutes or less, wit' my Hannibal mask
And when you ***** around and giggle in that cage
I know I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you had to let you know
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'
You makin' me feel like I'm in middle school still
You squeal like a little girl you pitiful, chill
We gon' fuck, I just popped this little blue pill
You can leave but wait, I gotta shit on you still
I shouldn't have to tell you shorty you should know
I hope you really gettin' in to my creep show
And let me shit on ya chest and if some pee comes out
Just guzzle it down, just guzzle it down

It's not my fault
It's not my fault, I can break it down
It's not my fault
It's not my fault, can ya break it down?
It's not my fault
It's not my fault, I can break it down
It's not my fault
It's not my fault, can ya break it down?
