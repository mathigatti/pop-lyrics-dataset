[Intro: Eminem]

I have no idea what I'm doing
I have no idea what I'm doing
But..


[Verse 1: Eminem]

Everybody get up, sit up Christopher
They're miserable without you
Superman is alive and he's flowing like the Mystic River
Girl dont act like you never been kissed before
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Thisa rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody ever find me
I disappeared I was hiding in Freeway's beard
Just a hop skip and a jump from my skin
Gushing nails into my face that I been pushin'
Hellraiser, My face is my pincushion
It's like when I'm on the mic
I can squish a sucker like a vice-grip
My pen put ya in the slaughterhouse
Cuz ya styles been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw
Take off like the blades on
My brain's on hyperdrive someone put the brakes on

[Hook: Eminem &amp; Mr. Porter]
Here's a smidget, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it
Err ribbit, ribbit
I got ya slippin on my swag juice
My swag juice
I got you slippin on my swag juice
My swag juice

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Cuz he gets as busy as a bee
Baby you can throw a frizbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth
What is he?
He's a wizard
Standing in the disco with a disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquick is it?
Now baby don't forget to bring your lipstick with ya
I want a kiss before I blow this bitch to smithe-reens
Get the guillotines, this is a situation that's critical
As Dre spins his uh turntables
And he cuts a record like a scissor
Cheka chicka checka chicka cheka cheka chicka
Who wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just to make a little breakfast
And it's six o-Clock in the morning
Unless you want to get some dessert

[Hook: Eminem &amp; Mr. Porter]
Now here's a smidget, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it
Err ribbit, ribbit
I got ya slippin on my swag juice
My swag juice
I got you slippin on my swag juice
My swag juice

I said...

Here's a smidget, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it
Err ribbit, ribbit
I got ya slippin on my swag juice
My swag juice
I got you slippin on my swag, my swag juice
