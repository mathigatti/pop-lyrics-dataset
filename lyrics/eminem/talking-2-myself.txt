(Intro)

Ayo, before I start this song man, I just wanna thank everyone for being so patient
And bearing with me over the last couple years while I figure this shit out


(Hook)

Is anybody out there,
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me yeah,
I guess I keep talking to myself
Feels like I'm going insane,
Am I the one who's crazy

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there,
Who feels the way I feel
That there is and let me know so
I know that I'm not the only one

(Verse 1)

I went away I guess that opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was going through growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him, cause of the attention he was getting
I felt horrible about myself, he was spitting and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzing back then could of got it
Almost went at Kanye too, god it feels like I'm going psychotic
Thank god that I didn't do it
I'd of had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth popping another pill, tryna talk
myself into it
Are you stupid? You gon' start dissing people for no reason
Especially when you can't even write a decent
punchline even
You're lying to yourself, you're slowing dying
You're denying, your health is declining with your
self esteem
You're crying out for help

(Hook)

Is anybody out there,
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me yeah,
I guess I keep talking to myself
Feels like I'm going insane,
Am I the one who's crazy

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there,
Who feels the way I feel
That there is and let me know so
I know that I'm not the only one

(Verse 2)

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echos in this hall though
But I must be talking to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talking to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false mavado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his
motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the brake, one of the
throttle
Falling asleep with writers block in the parking lot of Mcdonalds
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself, do
something about it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded
You're powdered long enough, It isn't them, it's you, you fucking baby
Quit worrying bout what they do and do Shady, I'm
fucking going crazy

(Hook)

Is anybody out there,
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me yeah,
I guess I keep talking to myself
Feels like I'm going insane,
Am I the one who's crazy

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there,
Who feels the way I feel
That there is and let me know so
I know that I'm not the only one

(Verse 3)

So I picked myself up off the ground, and fucking swam before I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, advice this
time around
It's different, them last 2 albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come to make it up to you, now no more fucking around
I got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally re-introduce
myself
To you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me, and homie I don't
show no
Signs of slowing or bowing, I'm blowing up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep your head up
T.I. keep your head up, Kanye keep your head up
Don't let up, just keep slaying em
Rest in peace to DJ AM, cause I know what this shit is like
I struggle with this shit every single day and I'm

(Hook)

Is anybody out there,
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me yeah,
I guess I keep talking to myself
Feels like I'm going insane,
Am I the one who's crazy

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there,
Who feels the way I feel
That there is and let me know so
I know that I'm not the only one

(Outro)

So there it is, damn, feels like I just woke up or
something
Guess I just forgot who the fuck I was man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at, it was never nothing personal
Just some shit that I was going through
And to the rest of you, I'm back!
