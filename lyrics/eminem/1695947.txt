Ayo Before I start this song man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
And baring with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out


Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

I went away I guess and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was going through, growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God it
Feels like I'm going psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, popping another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
'specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even?
You're lying to yourself
You're slowly dying, you're denying your health is declining with your self-esteem, you're crying out for help

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talking to the wall though I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talking to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Falling asleep with writer's block in the parking lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them it's you you fucking baby
Quit worrying 'bout what they do and do Shady, I'm fucking going crazy

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

So I picked myself off the ground and fucking swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come to make it up to ya now, no more fucking around
I got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowing up, oh and I'm blowing up all over my life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep ya head up
T.I. keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slaying 'em, rest in peace to DJ AM
Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)
