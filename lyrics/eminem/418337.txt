[Eminem]
Nah, we ain't gone
I love bein' hated, it's great it
Let's me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way
I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved
by so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
And as long, as you keep fuckin' with us, we keep fuckin' you up
And keep pullin' the rug from up under you
And what's ever more fucked up
is we enjoy what were doin' so much there ain't nothin'
that we love more than pullin' your skirts up
And exposin' you hoes so much, people are startin' to wonder
what's up wit' them fuckin' one dough a man under-els
Do unto others of you will have done under you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to when
someone runs up wit' a mask and puts a gun to you {*gun cocks*}
You will ask yourself, how come your mans
didn't enter that last round that he had
in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance
You keep askin' us to keep it on wax but we can't
This is past any rationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start buildin'
soon as we enter the 106 &amp; Park building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God
if someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch
I don't endanger people that I'm wit'
I'm a general, I ain't Bush
I don't send my soldiers to war
I'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em
So when I do get 'em
Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fuckin' with a...


[Swifty McVay]
Fuckin' wit' a peacekeeper
See you the nigga that greet this lyrical meat cleaver, that I eat ya
Niggaz wanna keep speakin', like it ain't even that deep
I got heat that'll sweep a niggaz street {*explosion*}
See I wouldn't fuck with me neither, only heaven can help ya
I'll be searchin' for you longer than the "Legend Of Zelda"
Without a failure, there's gonna be hell to tell the
captain that a Basset Hound couldn't even smell ya
body, when I hide ya, I be on that mob shit
You another Hoffa, under the Renaissance bitch
You get bombed like Lebanon {*explosion*} with my own tactic
I'll snatch your head like one of Saddam's kids

[Obie Trice]
Motherfucker I'll handle you
We can have it out on any Avenue
A "Average Man" flipped into an animal
Shoot out your mandibles
Cannons and ammunition, reload with precision
Nigga know the mechanicals
Break the pistol down, you should see them handles
The street taught the child, no read up manuals
Push your crack vows, young Nino Brown
Chasin' green is the dream, when you're young and brown
Bound to be a problem child
Look what I'm involved in now
A Dozen Dirty niggaz and they all get down
Dissolve any problem that enlarge with ours
When revolvers we said "all men get down" {*gunshot*} (come on!)

[Kuniva]
While your punchin' and tacklin' punks
I'm handlin' chumps, packin' a pump
that's longer than the elephant trunk {*gun cocks*}
On the streets I'm a beast, I feast upon the weak
So speak beef, I'll shot you and scream "increase the peace"
A monster, pistol packin' pushin' niggaz off they Hondas
Starve ya, get it crackin', yankin' bitches for they ganja
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough
When she was sleepin' stuff, I was stealin' the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up, before you end up dead in the dump truck
or in the streets takin' a nap, bleedin' and Lugged up
Who want what like M. Bleek, with this heat if you ten deep
Then fuck it, it'll be ten sleepin' {*gunshots*}

[Proof]
Know much about my a land ski
Don't tussle with my hand speed
Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast no holsters
Approach us, throw heat straight from the soldiers (come on!) {*gunshot*}
We the soldiers, y'all the youngsters (ha)
Youngsters lungs puncture, dead in a dumpster {*gunshot*}
Upstairs the Munsters, hand full of drama
You scared of the drama, bomber the monster {*gun cocks*} (boof)
I'm back nigga (woof), I reappear
Shoot like {*gunshot*}, homie steer clear
Blackness, carcass covered with catfish
We murkers with no purpose other than practice

[Bizarre]
There's three things I hate: liars, fakes and cheaters
Alcoholics, sluts and fuckin' wife beaters
A gat that describes my life
I don't even know who song this is ("Obie Trice")
Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop
At my release party in a pink tank top in Reeboks {*laughing*}
This Ja Rule beef I ain't gettin' in
I'll meet an R&amp;B singer to sing at my wedding (Say yeahhh)
I turn your face into a fuckin' meat patty
I'll fuck your mommy and go fishin' with your granny
I'll "Shit On You", I'll pee on R. Kelly too
This is Bizarre, see you at "Devils Night 2"
