I was doom riding on top a black horse 
Whatever prize there was 
I could only observe where the trouble starts 
Where does it end? 
I cannot be cured 
Before it ends 
I know life would be different if i held on (held on) 
I know i could be something if i held on 
Gave her love away 
Put it in my pocket when it should've been framed 
Oh, it lost its shine 
Gotta get this out of my head 
Out of my brain 
How could it end, 
End like this? 
How could it end? 
I know life would be different had i held on (held on) 
I know i could be something had i held on (held on) 
I know i could be something if i held on (held on) 
I know life would be different if i held on (held on) 
Held on 
Held on, if i held on 
Held on, if i held on 
Held on, if i held.
