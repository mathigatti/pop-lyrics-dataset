(Lil Wayne)
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so nevermind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, mu'fucka
'Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, mu'fucka


(Chorus)
So I pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone

(Lil Wayne)
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is the stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

(Chorus)
So I could pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone (I'm gone)

(Eminem)
It hurts, but I never show this pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream "Fuck 'em all"
Man, it feels like these walls are closing in this roof is caving in,
up its time to razor thin your days are numbered like pagers and
My book of rhymes, got 'em cookin', boy, this crooked mind of mine
got 'em all shook and scared to look in my eyes I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
Came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up, fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe that
I swear to God, won't spare the rod I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody!
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye, this world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible, hope you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dawg
I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives I'll fuckin'

(Chorus)
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone (I'm gone)
