Laying here in your arms
And you hold me tight, tight
Trying not to watch the clock
Tick, tickin as the time goes by
And I know that you best be on your way
But I'm wishin I could make you stay
Stay with me for a while


Though your near
Still I want to make it clear
Love, I will always be around

CHORUS:
Your leaving, I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before The Goodbye
I feel it, already
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before The Goodbye

Kind of hard for me to let you know
Cause I dont let my feelings show
How much I'll be missing you
All the little things that make me weak
Your eyes and the way you speak
Without you baby I'm not me

Though your near
Still I want to make it clear
Love, I will always be around

CHORUS

Your leaving, I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before The Goodbye
I feel it, already
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before The Goodbye

CHORUS

Your leaving
I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before The Goodbye....
