I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss


[Royce]
Uh, never meet a nigga first rap and beef with a shot of fam
Gucci's my absolute state of mind, like Waka's man
Chopper's brand, getting head in the car park, new Gallardo
This bitch sucking my dick today, call yesterday's news tomorrow
Stretch a nigga out, I'm the new Thai roll
'Bout to cross over, I'm the new Iver
'bout to saves a couple of these bitches
That's right, I'm the new Bible
You? You 5.0, me? I'm all grounded to punishments
But I'm too fly though
Y'all niggas rewinding, I should call you moscato

[Eminem]
Look down at the poor boy
Looks like he got no parents, little shoes, they untied ho
Never know what type of a ho inside of my ride I may let
Last night at 5 AM, and she ain't even recover from last Friday yet
Hoes all over the ride like it's an ice cream truck
I can see why they fret
I already ran over two hoes and I ain't get up the fucking drive way yet
Soon as I open the door, you try to resist, what for?
Get in girl, don't push (?)
Fightin' a war, it's useless, tits on a whore, little tits on a whore
Got a mack and it's screaming like little kids throwing fits on the floor
Get in the whip, but you ain't turning, a frog into a prince
What you tryna keep your hands on me for?

I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss

Now you in my whip as long as you understand that I can't be whipped
You sick of my shit, I'm a gigolo so you know, I'm always on the go
I ain't got no time to slow down for no relationshit
Drop the P and add a T, yaeh, you can get mad at me all you want
But I'm ghost before you can even say boo, hun let alone call me one
A one-night stand is only once but a female friend got one leg standing
But a one night stand on my nightstand
(?) I ain't fitting to argue but why
You think they call it boo? cause it sound like it's supposed to scare you

[Royce]
Ho, we can share you in the back of the Mclaren, I don't give a fuck
What your name is, I'll call you Hottentot, Hopenbot
How come your name is Sharon?
Slow the flow down so I can make
The same face when I'm shooting the guns is the same face I make when I fuck
The back of my hand on your neck pressing your face against the sheets it's insane
You been changed, cause I'm out of this world, girl I got that new (?) fame
I'm at an all-time high with highness, I'm at an all-time fly with flyness
And this is exactly what they say when they bow to your highness

I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss

[Verse 3]
Never meet a nigga Twitter-beefing, first beef and I shot your fans
(You should check out the car when it's moving like watch this man)
Her bottom's dark, but her top it tan
Her private parts on the pole
Like the opposite of her papa's plan

[Eminem]
Come on stripper! Let's ?
And drop the trance

[Royce]
Looking at this girl, like what you wearing
Quit playing!

[Eminem]
You wearing them scrach n sniff pants?
Well let me scratch em

[Royce]
What? Did I say that?
I'm on lean like styrofoam cups and kickstands

[Eminem]
Middle finger stuck on fuck
But girl you got a butt like ?
Aw Hell, Shady, he'll tell it like it is
So tell Katie Perry he's downstairs waiting
I'm here, bell's ringing and tell Lady
Gaga she can quit her job at the post office
She's still a male lady!
What the fuck? You heard, the verdict's in
He's allergic to D, that's the dick

[Royce]
I like the strip tease you doing
This evening, you and me gonna find
3 more chickenheads and have a menage like Nick
You hot like a thick outfit in Texas
Without your underwear under it
Suck my dick, we both gets to steppin to my logic

[Eminem]
My dick is as hard as a yardstick
What we gonna do? Ride around til we're carsick
Then I'm gonna put this shit in park
And you can blow me in the dark in the parking lot
Out of the trailer park by the garbage
What you waiting on? Me to roll up?
The condoms are in the glove compartment, lets start it!
Think I'm joking? What, am I sitting here
Trying to make fake farts with my armpits?
Am I here to amuse you?

[Royce]
I'm in your pocket outside of a church
The other hand is at the bottom of your purse
You giving me head in a boxing stance
My dick's so big you could drop it in dirt
I'm not your man, we're sparring partners
There's 5 things you are in charge of, that's
Sucking a dick, sucking a dick, sucking a dick
Sucking a dick, sucking a dick

[Eminem]
If you ain't sucking a dick
Why you sitting there with puckered lips? That's collagen..
Motherfucking bitch, what you mean how'd you
Get suckered into this you gonna jump into my truck
And then try to get truculent?

[Royce]
You should be suffering, you should be cooking
You should be buckling your seatbelt with oven mitts

[Eminem]
I know I'm making an ass of myself, but it's just
Cause I wanna get..

I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
