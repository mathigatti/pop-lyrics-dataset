(Chorus)
nigga guess whos bazack its not beanie seagel J hoe 
50 cent yah niggas should know 
so let me relapse

Verse 1:
Fuck being in a cage man that shit for the birds
i do my dirt in the hood but i live in the burbs
when you talk be carefull how you choose your words
cause i send niggas that put your fucking brains in the curb
am i my brothers keeper? yes i am 
nigga you know you get low you see that gun in my hand
G unit 
dont go fucking with my soldiers boy 
if you get layed out
i'm a sya i told you boy
i see you rollin wit twenty niggas 
we rollin wit twenty guns
16 hollos is loaded in everyone
i know you slow so i do the math
thats 320 shels flying at your ass
you spend alot of time talking bout how you roll out
when you get hit you gonna run until you fall down
i guess you didn't think we was down to go all out
once again you was wrong
you aint know the shit we on
my money getting long
now my team is getin strong 
im gone (gone)
