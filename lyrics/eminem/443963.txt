Cherish
cherish -


So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game.
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance.
You are my destiny
I can't let go
baby
can't you see ?
cupid
please
take your aim at me.

Cherisk the thought of always
having you here by my side

oh
baby
I cherish dhe joy
you keep bringing it into my life.
I'm always singing it.
Cherish the strength
you got the power to make me feel good

and
baby
I'll perish the throught of ever leaving

I never would.

I was never satisfied with casual encounters.
I can't hide my need for two hearts
that bleed with burning love

that's the way it's got to be.
Romeo and Juliet
they never felt this way I bet

so don't underestimate my point of view.

Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
...

Who ? You ! - Can't get away
I won't let you.
Who ? You ! - I could never forget to.
Cherish is the world I use to remind me of your love.

Together
you're giving it to me
boy.
Keep giving me all
all
all your joy.
Give me faith
I will always cherish you.
Romeo and Juliet
they never felt this way I bet

so don't underestimate this point of view.

Who ? You ! - Can't get away
I won't let you.
Who ? You ! - I could never forget to.
Cherish is the world I use to remind me of your love.

Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side

Give me faith

I could never forget to.
Cherish the thought
