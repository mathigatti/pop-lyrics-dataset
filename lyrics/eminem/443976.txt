Yeah

You get under my skin
When I'm next to you
You get over
Every little thing you do, I


I was thinking that you never tried to hurt me
Never wanted something from me, tried to warn me
But you didn't really want me but I want you
'Cause you haunt me and I felt it from the start

You're going to break my heart
So I tried to play the part
And I knew I had to choose
I've got nothing left to lose
Might as well just tell the truth

Chorus:

You get under my skin
When I'm next to you
You get over
Every little thing you do
I can't get with it
Can't put the blame on you
'Cause you get under my skin
I can't get over you

I was hoping, I was dreaming that I'd wake up
Think about it and I found that I had made up
But my heartbeat tells me it's not true, I want you
Gotta have you, tell me why can't we just start

Bridge:

You want to break my heart
Now you're underneath my skin
And I feel like it's a sin
To let love walk away so fast
I'm not your first, won't be your last

(chorus)

Intermediate: 

Get up, get over, get under
Oh baby you hit me like thunder
Get over, get under, get into
To love you is almost a sin to
(repeat)

Start
(bridge)
(chorus)
(intermediate)
(chorus)

Get, get over
Get, get over
Get over

Get, get over
Get, get over
