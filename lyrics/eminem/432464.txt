Don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there
Just lift your head, and let your feelings out instead
And don't be shy, just let your feelings roll on by
On by, on by, on by, on by, on by, on by


You know love is better than a song
Love is where all of us belong
So don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by
And don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there
You're there, you're there, you're there, you're there
You're there, you're there, you're there, you're there

So don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by
And don't wear fear or no one will know you're there
You know love is better than a song
Love is where all of us belong
Belong, long, long, belong, belong, belong
