Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Like I'm reaching out for you?


I'm just so fucking depressed I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but
I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up and in order for me to pick the mic back up
I dont know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I started to feel distant again so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent but I just cant admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor everythings so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room just as soon as
I walk in I'ts like all eyes on me so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cuz if I do that then it opens the door for conversation like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of them ain't even funny like hahhhhh
"Marshall you're so funny man you should be a comedian god damn"
Unfortunately I am I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale that I'm about to tell
Hell we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you don't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you

Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip them don't expect no help
Now I could have either just stayed at home sit on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation with which I'm placed in and get up and kick my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hope and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt edna always told me keep making that face and it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there holding my tongue trynwa twalk like dwis
Then I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cuz I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story not just based on my description
Cuz where you see it from where your sitting it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear tens lets see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Like I'm reaching out for you?

Yeah
To my babies
Stay strong
Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you shoes to fit you
So put them on and wear them
Be yourself man
Be proud of who you are
And even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let anyone tell you you ain't beautiful
