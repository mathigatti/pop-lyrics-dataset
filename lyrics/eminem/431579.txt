Feeling strange, turn around do it again
Feeling alright, feel like contact tonight
Well you know what it says and you know what you feel
And you know what it's like and you know it's for real
Take it to the limit, take it to the height
Take it to the limit, contact tonight


Don't speak, don't break the spell
Let's dance, you dance so well
I contact you, you contact me
Across the room our glances meet
I contact you
Eye contact, eye contact

Feeling fine, feel like dynamite
Eyes speak more than words can say
Sparks fly eye contact is made
Well you know what it says and you know what you feel
And you know what it's like and you know it's for real
So take it to the limit, take it to the height
Take it to the limit, contact tonight

Breathe deep let your feelings show
Let's dance but not too slow
I contact you, you contact me
Across the room our glances meet
I contact you
Eye contact, eye contact

Take it to the limit, take it to the limit
Eye contact, eye contact
