{*Phone ringing*}
Hello!
What up?
Hello?
Yo I can't, I can't hear you
I'll call you right back {*Hanging up phone*}


I sense someone's tapping into my phones why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon
The F.B.I might be tryin' to pull my file soon
I might be walking blind fold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
right outside of the window of my living room
And if they do you can say goodnight and bye bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking dead man
Blank stare, dead pan, look at my face as I gaze into space
as I wait to be scooped up in that van
just mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gon' say a sniper just appeared out of nowhere
And I'll go down in the history as the bloodsucking leech
who hid behind the freedom of speech?
Tried to take the fifth amendment use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dying to fill out in the hero's splinters
The business way to end this I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11
Flash back to September 7, when Tupac was murdered in Vegas
He said that he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
like the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
by a craze lunatic with a gun
who just happened to work
on the same block in a library book, depository
where the President, would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they?
Who's they for 'em to say "Touch√©"
We're all vulnerable and it's spooky
This is about as cookey, as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
You can run, you can do what you want to
but you know you ain't gonna do nuttin'
When it's time it's your time
You are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy Number 1
