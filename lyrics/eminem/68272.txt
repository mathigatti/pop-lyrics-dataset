What You Say

Intro
Dre: Oh, so I'm out the game, huh
Eminem: Yo Dre, we ridin'?
Dre: Whatever...
Eminem: Well I'm wit ya homie
Dre: Okay, well let's handle the small shit


Verse 1
Eminem:
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit, kick up dust, cusstill I slur up spit
grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit,corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
thick 'n rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth, Dre told me tomilk this shit for what it's worth
till the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth, and if Ifumble a verse, keep going, first take
I make mistakes just keep it, no punches pull, no punches, that'sweak shit
fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll eat shit, wasn't for him,wouldn't be shit 

Dre:
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane, beenhere longer than anyone in the game
and I ain't got to lie about my age, "But what about Jermaine?"Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland'sname
and don't think I don't read your lil' interviews and see whatyou're sayin', I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move
till I'm provoked, when I see you, I'ma step on you and not evenknow it
you midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-yous, runnin'round your backyard swimmin' pools
over eighty million records sold, and I ain't have to do it withten or eleven year olds 

Chorus (X2)
Cus what you say is what you say, say what you say how you say itwhenever you sayin' it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it, so whoyou playin' wit, huh? 

Verse 2
Eminem:
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this,amatuers drink veteran piss
from a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up or confuse me with aCannabis or Dre with a Dupri
we'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you blackballed and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here to play devil's advocate

Dre:
If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry, thatcould save it when I'm gone and buried
to make sure the tradition carries on, I would 

Eminem:
If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even ifI could 

Dre:
From the hood, and I'm a hornet, and I'ma only sting when Icornered 

Eminem: 
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
and swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off, cus I know ifthey get up, I won't get a chance to let off
another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk, don't give a fuck,White-Pac, so much spunk
when I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill, or growup to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer 

Dre:
And I'm, somethin' of a phenom, one puff of the chron, I'munstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
there's no obstacle that I can't conquer so come along witus….Cmon 

Chorus (X2)

Verse 3
Dre:
Now anybody who knows Dre, knows I'm about fast cars and Alize,partyin' all day
but I handled my business, cus it' work before play, don't lookfor trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
however you want it, you can have it your way, you fuck my nightup, I'ma fuck up your day
bullet with your name, sendin' it your way, that goes for anyonewho walks through that doorway
cus this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it, andyou'll die tryin' to violate it
fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dialated 

Eminem: 
Like my old lady?
Cus what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean is twodifferent things, depending on your mood if it swings
think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed, I can doanything, catch a contact and I'm gone
and I'm back, I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad 

Dre:
And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything
catch a contract on your head, you headed west, talk shit aboutDre, you better get a vest
and invest in something to protect your head and neck 

Eminem: 
And it's back and forth, all day like Red and Meth, I joke when Isay I'm the best, in the booth, but a lot of truth is said injest
and if I ever do live to be a legend I'ma die a sudden death
five mics in the Source, ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath, butI'll suffocate for the respect 'fore I breathe
to collect a fuckin' check 

Chorus (X2)

Outro

Dre: Watch your fuckin' mouth 

Timbaland: Yo this Timbaland. Tell'em I said suck…my dick
