SAY WHAT YOU SAY

---------------

Intro
(Dre) Oh, so I'm out the game, huh
(Eminem) Yo Dre, we ridin'?
(Dre) Whatever...
(Eminem) Well I'm wit ya homie
(Dre) Okay, let's handle the small shit


Verse 1
(Eminem) I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit, kick up dust, cuss till I slur up spit/grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit, corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch/thick 'n rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth,Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth/till the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth, and if I fumble averse, keep going, first take/I make mistakes just keep it, no punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit/fake shit, if I evertake shit I'll eat shit, wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit

(Dre) Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane,been here longer than anyone in the game/and I ain't got to lieabout my age, "But what about Jermaine?" Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name/and don't think I don't read your lil' interviews and see what you're sayin', I'm agiant, and I ain't gotta move/till I'm provoked, when I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it/you midget, mini-me with abunch of mini-yous, runnin' round your backyard swimmin'pools/over eighty million records sold, and I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds

Chorus X2
Cus what you say is what you say, say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it/just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' wit, huh?

Verse 2
(Eminem) Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this, amatuers drink veteran piss/from a dixie cup, if you evermix me up or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri/we'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin'-gain/Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here to play devil's advocate

(Dre) If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry, that could save it when I'm gone and buried/to make sure the tradition carries on, I would

(Eminem) If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even if I could

(Dre) From the hood, and I'm a hornet, and I'ma only sting when I'm cornered

(Eminem) And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning/and swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off, cus I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off/another punch, I'm punkrock, no one's punk, don't give a fuck, White-Pac, so much spunk/when I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill,or grow up to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer

(Dre) And I'm, somethin' of a phenom, one puff of the chron, I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again/there's no obstacle thatI can't conquer so come along wit us·.Cmon

Chorus X2

Verse 3
(Dre) Now anybody who knows Dre, knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin' all day/but I handled my business, cus it' work before play, don't look for trouble, but I'll serve your gourmet/however you want it, you can have it your way, you fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day/bullet with your name, sendin' it your way, that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway/cus this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it,and you'll die tryin' to violate it/fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dialated

(Eminem) Like my old lady?/Cus what you say is what you say,sometimes what you mean is two different things, depending onyour mood if it swings/think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone/ and I'm back, I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad

(Dre) And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything/catch a contract on your head, you headed west, talkshit about Dre, you better get a vest and invest in something toprotect your head and neck

(Eminem) And it's back and forth, all day like Red and Meth, I joke when I say I'm the best, in the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest/and if I ever do live to be a legend I'ma die a sudden death/five mics in the Source, ain't holdin' my fuckin'breath, but I'll suffocate for the respect 'fore I breathe/ to collect a fuckin' check

Chorus X2

Outro
(Dre) Watch your fuckin' mouth
(Timbaland) Yo this Timbaland. Tell'em I said suck·my dick
