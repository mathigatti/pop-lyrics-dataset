[Verse 1 - Kuniva]
Yo the derelict is back 
Im blazin niggas while they up in the Sheraton last

You niggas is bitch straight up im bearin the facts 
I love pussy wit all my heart but i married the gats 
And nigga im top pedigree so dont play wit me 
Ill blow your tattoos all over your baby seat 
Kids and all be hit 
Peers and all masuberg will take your back, liver ribs and all 
Kuniva the street talker, heat sparker the beef starter 
Packin guns when im sleep walkin

Throwin fire bombs down your chimney 
While you eatin at wendys 
Im in your bushes cockin the semi 
Nice wit the hands 
Never bow down to another man 
I was poppin guns while you was still poppin some rubber bands 
Smother your clan 
Sever your hands and your legs 
Mail your brother your heart and send your mother ya head 

[Swifty]
Im the only one your bitch let touch her 
Type of brother that will fuck your mother 
With a fishnet rubber 
A belligerent and rowdy mother fucker 
That'll dump your body and still fly away to maui on the ??
When it comes to beefin

Ill change your language wit a stainless 
Im contained wit a anguish to leave your famous 
Im a deranged pit yall lift an AK to pinch ya face wit 
Niggas dont say shit fuck your hype man if its a bystander standin by im firein at ya, cause i can 
You get squashed like pop cans 
I be shootin 7up in your mouth man 
Im about to sell your mama bud, and lace it 
So when she fire it up she coughin blood 
I love to see um wasted 
Im made to behave in this case 
You try to be brave in this rage and your legs will be replaced 

[Chorus - Eminem]
Bitch keep talkin 
Keep on popin off with them jaws because 
We aint stoppin 
We aint got to prove shit to yall so all yall can lick the balls and keep walkin 
Keep on poppin that shit you poppin 
Cause we aint stoppin cuz you aint stoppin us 
We aint got to prove shit to yall so all yall can lick the balls and keep walkin
