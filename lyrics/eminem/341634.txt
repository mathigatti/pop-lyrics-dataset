[Irv Gotti]
Everybody wants to make comparisons to Pac, and X, and me, YALL
NIGGAZ want to see Pac come back? You want to see this shit?
He's in, he's here.


[Eminem]
Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a .12 gauge shotti

[2x]

(HAIL MARY} Come get me
If you mothafuckers want Shady
{Background:
And ja said he shall be the lost begotten seed of 2pac
To lead this industry into the ways of the man
Follow me
Keep my mesh vest as pacs vest}
If Pac was still here now,
He would never ride with Ja,
na na na na na na na na

[Eminem]
You ain't no killa, you a pussy
That exstacy dun' got you all emotional and moushy
Bitches wearin rags in photos, Ja's words bein quoted
In the SOURCE, stealin 'Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouth, pray to God, hopin no one's listenin
See 50 comin for me, Oh my God my, my position
No one pays attention
To me, please Gotti, here I go
Gimme this pill, exstacy dun' got me feelin so
Invincible
Now all of a sudden I'm a fuckin mad man who screams
Like I'm 'Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennesy
Actin like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm CRAZY
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'ma quit
Sayin mothafucka's name's before somebody fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you hell, fucker

[Eminem &amp; Busta in background]
Come get me
Motherfucker, If you want Shady
If Pac was still here now,
He would never ride with Ja
Na, na, na, na ,na, na, na, na

Get off that E
Before you try to come and fuck with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La, la, la, la , la, la, la, la

[50 Cent]
Penatenturies is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time them bitch niggas is wastin
Insitutionalize, my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from the cell, G-Unit mothafucka, WE BALLIN
Catch me count trees and when I'm callin
Can you set my car, Ceo let me sip on Henessy, "Can I sip some
more?"
Hell, I done been in jail, I ain't scared
Momma checkin in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Mothafuckas thinkin they can stop 50... they losin it
Lil' nigga named Ja, think he live like me
Talkin about he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies nigga
I rejected deposit
When your lil sweet ass goin come out of the closet
now he wonderin why DMX blowed him out
next time grown folks talkin bitch close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Seen too many real niggas ballin let these bitch niggas beat me
yous a mothafuckin punk and you dont see me with gloves
quit scarin them fuckin kids with ya ugly ass mug
and you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
but you and i know whats goin on
Nigga pay back Tah, I know your bitch ass from way back
Witness be strap with max You know I don't play that
All these old rappers tryin to advance its all over now -- take
it like a man
HAHA--Irv lookin like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
tryin to playa hate on my shit- Made of fat dick
Lovin this shit thats how you made me
feelin like I got you niggas crazy (Uh huh)
Against all odds up with my thug mothafuckas know
This'll be the realist shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin blow to the truest
shit i ever spoke, 21 gun salute

[(Fades in) Busta Rhymes:]
Hey yo I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the
core
Hey Jeffrey, What the fuck you come involvin me for?
It's been a long time comin like a bless and a check
you see 106 and park fans don't even fuckin respect you
Its kinda funny wanna be Pac, wanna fake like he thug
runnin around talkin shit that he ain't capable of
now let me OFF this cock sucka watch me handle you nigga
If i recall Violator used to manage you nigga
then took a closer look and realized you was an impostor theres
never been a Violator on a Murda Inc
roster.
Dumb ass Now who shoot?-- I made you look, you said Bus' singin
the same ol' hook,
You Stupid if yall shootin' I take a look at ya man tha bitch
shot himself in front of Def Jam
Chedda Bob ass niggaz start adjustin ya plan
you let the streets down nigga 'pologize to ya fans
watch ya pull a lil stunt like we ain't know what it was
Lil faggot desperate tryin to re-establish a buzz I know tha
shit is drivin you crazy You wonderin how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice what you gonna do
now?
Now if you wanna beef with me, then i'm beefin with you
I think about tha game and what its like AH--WHAT WOULD IT BE
WITHOUT YOU
You finished I ain't tryin to repeat this just because I'm cool
shouldn' take my kindness for weakness (50 laughs: Oh shit)

[Busta speakin]
It was fine Next time you got a problem mate, Address me
before you try to make tha shit a public issue homie, Now i'ma
return back to my regular self
and have fun again

[50 Cent Outro]
