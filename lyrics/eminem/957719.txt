[ Intro ] [Eminem ]

Ayo, yo, this motherfucken Eminem, Dirty Dozen
'Bout to show you how we set it when we come through
Know what I'm sayin', word up, bitch motherfuckers better raise up
y'all motherfuckers better raise up, ayo buss it


[ Verse 1 ] [ Eminem ]

Ayo, I'ma pit-bull terrier, triple darin' ya, scarin' ya with a derringer
ready to make you wet like a Submariner, tearin' ya frame out with homicidal lines
Bringin' the drama an the trauma to ya mama's vital signs (Blaw!)
A verbal shot fired, this mic's been hot wired, uppercuts to your chin knockin' your snot skyward
Rappers wanna be screenplay actors, so I'm givin' them spine fractures
like linebackers on the Green Bay Packers, an roll over 'em backwards
Dirty Dozen, I'm someone you just don't wanna see like a nerdy cousin
So keep your distance when I get this tense, you see my fist clench
It's gonna be some bullets dispensed, you besta keep yo premescence fixed
Your mistense, any resistance, get you voided like mis-prints
You'll end up with no teeth left makin' a beef threat
When I look up on your set, don't get it twisted like Keith Sweat

[ Chorus ] [ Eminem ]

When I get the bussin, you best be get to jumpin
I'm touchin' somethin', fool I'm comin' through dumpin
My beat's bumpin', you hear it thumpin', that oughta tell you somethin
Bitch I'm comin' through dumpin
Bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin', you blood starts clumpin
I'm comin' through dumpin
If you don't know you best make an assumption, I got you slumpin
Fool I'm comin' through dumpin

[ Verse 2 ] [ Proof ]

A proven fact my pact got your whole team movin' back
We never losin' slack, I paid dues in rap
I'm runnin' crews my shoes are tapped
My right is choosin' gats, my thugs ?-use ?-acks
Relax an catch a contact, to an amusin' track, slugs dispatched
On any street risen? mismatched
My team'll get busy like rednecks on some 6 packs
My fist crack the featherweight, my word's'll never break
A clever snake'll be forever fake, let me get this cheddar straight
Makin' dough is a part, so is the heart, my flow is the art
Me an the mic Gomez like Lois &amp; Clark
Weapons concealed until death, now see 'em, my chrome shatter bones that lack calcium,
Knockin' domes out the ballpark, your dawgs is all bark, plus you got a small heart
Now save them corny lines for Hallmark
I wanna the sunny days &amp; money paid in they figures
A microphone fiend an on my own team there's fake niggas
Mum's they rocked the cradle, I spot the fable
They made the shop an stable, with grass top the table
The glock enable when I pop the fatal, phonies that I plot pre-natal wax
The player haters never make it back
I'm dumpin

[ Chorus ] [ Eminem ]

When I get the bussin, you best be get the jumpin
I'm touchin' somethin', fool I'm comin' through dumpin
My beat's bumpin', you hear it thumpin', that oughta tell you somethin
Bitch I'm comin' through dumpin
Bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin', you blood starts clumpin
I'm comin' through dumpin
If you don't know you best make an assumption, I got you slumpin
I'm comin' through straight dumpin

[ Verse 3 ] [ B-Flat ]

Ayo, We don't say fat, we stay scroll? bizness
The 3rd nigga on the mic, representin Rough Anopolies?
Ain't shit stoppin' us, old school like Cold Crush
Spice &amp; dice MC's on the mic like cold cuts
Live N direct, comin' straight from the debt? where niggas
keep it real an make these girls panties wet
I can't forget the D.J., he play, we say funky type of
shit that make the crowd wanna flip
We don't bust clips, guns is not in us, but when shit gets deep it's a must that we bust
I'ma lay lead on the head, for afro's and fazaball head's all the way down to the dreads
40's we drink, endo's we smoke, and the rims that we ride on, is true these are spokes, tryes
No ally the Micheals? but they don't live on ?Myers?
Bitches pussy tight, here comes the dick pliers
What's my name, call me siah, rewind on the mic like titty dancers on a fire
When you hear my beats, kickin' live crowds jumpin', I'm comin' through dumpin

[ Chorus ] [ B-Flat ]

Other MC's like Doug-E-Fresh ain't sayin' nuttin
Bitch nigga I'm comin' through dumpin
Go to the church, ill have the dick an cold humpin
Cause my shit be comin' through dumpin

[ Verse 4 ] [ Eye Kyu ]

When I'm lifted, don't quiz this it ain't worth it to risk it
I'm quick with the gift &amp; twice as swift with a biscuit
Headed back to fresh off a niggas ass around Christmas
They know it's what time of year, they be expectin' my visits
Doin' Ninety on the encil, rushin' to get there to twist you niggas like a pretzel
Blows come in three's like Godfather Trilogy
I'm Michael Corleone with this mic, bitch y'all aint killin me
Let me see some heads and make sure y'all feelin' me
I'm stickin' you up for all props and y'all gone give 'em up willingly
Rap is my life and that's why everyday i live it
Punchin' holes in the flow of wack rappers like a rivet
mad nigga in here is bringin' drama this thick
When they try to come up shorter than floods on a mdget
Shiit, can ya dig it?

[ Chorus ] [ Eye Kyu ]

Crew comin' through with somethin
Guaranteed to have your whole fucken block jumpin', we comin' through dumpin
When we come, we got your knees crumblin', y'all niggas ain't sayin' nuttin
Cause we comin dumpin
What you talkin', nigga get to walkin', see ya bitch ass crew halkin
But we goin' get to dumpin
You don't want it, go ahead an back up of it, I'ma let you know how it is
nigga's just be dumpin
