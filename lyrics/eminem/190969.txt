Waiting to cut out the rappers
Waiting to clean up the city's
Waiting to follow the rats
Waiting to put on a rock-song
Waiting to weed out the bullies
Waiting to smash in their radio's
And kick over their turn-tables
Waiting for the final solution to strenghten the strain
Waiting to follow the rats
Waiting to turn on the showers 
And fire the ovens
Waiting for the R&amp;b bullies and the rappers 
And the nazi's and the racists
Waiting ro follow the rats
Would you like to see Rock rule again? my friend?
Uh-huuu-huuu All you have to do is follow the RATS
