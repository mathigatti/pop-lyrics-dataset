Eminem:
Shady, aftermath
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control


Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fuucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on your shoestring
Showin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this b is gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get nate dogg here to sing some shit

Nate Dogg:
Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the d
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and hennessey
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen and dropped
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'ma continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up

Nate Dogg:
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Eminem:
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride???
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
Yeah me and nate d-o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple e's
Slip it in her bubbuly, we finna finna have a party

Nate Dogg:
Have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
Apple bottom jeans and a big old slut
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can't but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?
I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine

Eminem:
Now I'ma hope you don't get mad at me
But I told nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him that you like it from behind

Nate Dogg:
We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up

Eminem:
There she goes, shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control

Eminem:
C'mon, I ain't leaving without you, bitch, c'mon with me,
And my boy, and his boy, and his boy and his girl...nate dogg.
