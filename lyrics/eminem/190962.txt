Eminem (chorus) :

Cuz we came here to set this party off
Right- let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz i don't ever wanna leave again
Without- at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time


Eminem:

Get ya ass up for the doctor
One more time
Get ya ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger
Its another club banger
Got ya hangin on the edge of ya seat
Get on down

Dr. dre:

Times up
Game's over
You lose, i win
Time to show these knucle heads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year
Next phase begin
Look whos got you goin crazy again
Im a trend
I set one every time i'm in
I go out and just come back
Full circle again
You a fad
That means somethin' that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back

Eminem (both):

Too bad
You're off the map now
Radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind
You slip, we out __ you
Walk around mad
You let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin
Your ___ aint behind you
Enough with the pissin, and moanin' whinin' an bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen
You'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums lay to 3 diamond
World- wide
We on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

Chorus:

Cuz we came here to set this party off
Right- let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz i don't ever wanna leave again
Without- at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

Eminem:

When doctor dre says crunk
You will get it crunk
(get it crunk)
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump
You'll get on one foot and-
Jump, jump, jump, jump

Dr. dre:

The buzz is tremendous
We drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it
For you to know the doc is off the bitches

Eminem:

We keep the party rockin off the hinges
We aint showin off
We just goin off popular consensus

Dr dre:

But critics say that doc is soft
Doc is talk, doc is all washed up
Knock it off
Who the fuck is doc impressin?
Doc is this, doc is that
You got the wrong impression
You must me on the cock
And doctor's not, if you on guessin
So dj take the needle and just drop it on the record

(what?)

We gon have this motherfucker off hoppin' in a second

(bump bump)

That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch ya itch for it
Like fresh cut grass

Eminem:

Cuz we done swam with the sharks
Wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap
To bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace to cover rolling stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Callin the caped crusaders
And me and dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day
Like hot-potato game
That's why we came ta'

Chorus:

Cuz we came here to set this party off
Right- let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz i don't ever wanna leave again
Without- at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

Fifty cent! come on!

50 cent:

Bounce now
Hands up
You know how we do
We make the club jump
Everywhere we go
It's no secret
Everybody know
When dre's involved
There's plenty money involved

Dre:

And pleanty honey's involved
Sundays and palm trees
Cali - everyday is just another party
From the valleys
All the way to them 8 mile alleys
Let's rally

Eminem:

Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out ya seat
Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound a' weed
6 days up out the week

Dre:

You could catch me in the studio
Bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat
That keep blazin up out ya speaker

Eminem:

So never say never
Cuz shady/ aftermath together
Along with g-unit records
Presents the of the return of the
The doc
(and shady)
No one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shread a' evidence

And uh...

Chorus

Cuz we came here to set this party off
Right- let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz i don't ever wanna leave again
Without- at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
