Gambler, gambler

Chorus:

I'm a gambler, and I will take you by surprise
Gambler, I'll aim this straight between your eyes
Gambler, yeah I know all the words to say
'Cause I'm a gambler, I only play the game my way, yeah


Don't want to say this but I think that I should
I'm better off forgotten if you think that I'd be good
One day you see me the next day I'm gone
Don't fight me baby I don't want to hold on
I'm a gambler, a gambler

You're not happy with the way I act
You better turn around boy, don't look back
You're getting angry, you know I can see
You're just jealous 'cause you can't be me

(chorus)

Intermediate:

You can't stop me now
'Cause I'm right and I'm making advances
Let me show you how
Tonight, I'll be taking my chances
On you, on you, on you, on you, that's right baby

I'm a gambler, gambler
You understand what I'm talking about?

(chorus)
(intermediate)

I'm a gambler, a gambler
Gambler, 'cause I'm a gambler

You can't stop me now
I'm on the road baby I know how
You can't stop me now
Oh no

You can't stop me now (repeat 3 times)

'Cause I'm a gambler, yeah I'm a gambler
That's right baby
