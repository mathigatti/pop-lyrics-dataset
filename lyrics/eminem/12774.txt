[Eminem]
As long as your citys got the bombs?

Then your cities got the...

[Royce Da 5'9]

Gold bottles, green bottles, Cris' to the Don

If you hate me, you hate the 'D', nigga please

[Royce Da 5'9]
Suburban and city niggas hussle together
Long as there's money involved, niggas'll tussle together
Long as the hussle's, a hussle, the green is green
White is white, nigga we buying if the price is right
So, drop the mic's, everything's on cock

You cant say we cant work, 

[Eminem]

[Royce Da 5'9]
Either we some plant workers, or we some niggas the plant worked,what!

You can just ask any one of your niggas that visit about it
Any seven mile bitch, know how'ta get rich
She'll fuck you till you sleep, plus lie to your bitch
Plus she'll suck the swallow up outta your dick
And she keep a sugar daddy that'll buy her some shit (come on)

The city with the bars, 
with the most women cars are produced, 
here we are, we've been...

[Royce Da 5'9]
In the casinos, card shuffle's, number's to bet
Disrespect, and get a new smile under you neck
A city full of thug ass niggas and punk rockers
A lot of niggas act like Pac, so cops watch 'em
The shop blocks up, in the black or the light Timb's
White boys look, act and rap like Slim 

[Eminem]
(Hi!)

[Royce Da 5'9]
Fight music, night fuses, never respect it, 
Guns talk, high schools with metal detectors
A city full of Tommy Hearst thumpers
Grant Hill hoopers, Barry Sanders runners, stunners 
caldians we, connects like whoa!
hyper weed, no need to test like 'dro!
hyper cats you got dough, they like so
real then you might go (where?)

[Eminem]
Rock City, (rock, come on)
Come on and rock with me

Come on the block with me
Rock City
And come and rock with me
Rock City, Come on
Rock, (on) City... COME ON!
