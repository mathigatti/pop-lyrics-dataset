I dont even know how to explain it, you know? 
You know, from time to time she`s on my mind you know 
I mean She`s my kinda girl 
You know every now and then you might find somebody you feel
like understands you a lil bit, you know? 
It`s all good man 


(Chorus) 
She`s something like a porno star 
She`s something like a super freak 
I never seen her on tape before 
But when she go low she`s a pro-fes-sion-al 
My kinda girl 
Porno star 
She`s something like a super freak 
Never seen her on tape before 
But when she go low she`s a pro-fes-sion-al 

(Lloyd Banks) 
Around the Carolina hood see, most niggas called her ho and diss
her 
Cuz she`s slowly growing up to be like her older sister 
She got a bad reputation so you don`t hold and kiss her 
And after one conversation you`d probly fold in twister 
It ain`t hard to tell that honey`s dumb 
She`s 18 goin on 21 
Mama don`t know where she get her money from 
Hoppin in the naughty cars 
Stuffed in the backseat 
Lookin to score big 
Cuz she fucks all the athletes 
Somethin like a princess gon wrong 
Used to be a ballerina 
Now she performs to "The Thong Song" 
Happily had plans to enroll in college 
Now you`d rather slide down metal poles for dollas 
Your fingernails and your toes is polished 
But your brain`s on freeze 
In other words frozen knowledge 
All your plans and your goals - demolished 
You grew up in Southside 
Why niggas know you a ho in ?Hollis? huh? 

(Chorus) 
Something like a porno star 
She`s something like a super freak 
I never seen her on tape before 
But when she go low she`s a pro-fes-sion-al 
My kinda girl 
Porno star 
She`s something like a super freak 
Never seen her on tape before 
But when she go low she`s a pro-fes-sion-al 
My kinda girl 

(Lloyd Banks) 
I still remember how it all started 
School - cuttin from class 
Every boy you knew touching yo` ass 
Headed no where fast 
I ain`t gon` lie 
Shorty I used to laugh 
Cuz you was the main topic on ??? 
I seen her in the mall shoppin 
I`m contemplating bout stoppin 
Cuz she could get me off like Cochran 
Now that dinner was poppin 
Spoiled, her daddy was pumpin 
He probly thought she`d grow up to get married or somethin 
But little did he know 
His little princess was a city ho 
Pretty, ooh the face 
Tight from the video 
Damn, this bitch is thick 
She on the Lil Kim shit 
See her hair match the color of her lipstick 
Now this chick claimed to love jewelry like Slick Rick 
And had a walk on her that would leave you with a stiff dick 
Jeans had a sick fit 
To make a long story short 
This ain`t the type a bitch you wanna stick with 

(Chorus) 
Porno Star 
She`s somethin like a super freak 
I never seen her on tape before 
But when she go low she`s a pro-fes-sion-al 
My kinda girl 
Porno star 
She`s somethin like a super freak 
I never seen her on tape before 
But when she go low she`s a pro-fes-sion-al 
My kinda girl
