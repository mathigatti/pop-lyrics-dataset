Yo yo yo yo yo (this is)
This is my motherfucking anthem (hip hop)
To hip hop music (anthem)
Cause I'm gonna keep doing hip hop music
until the day that I die (aight bitch)


Yo I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and ugji boards
Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like Tupac's
Jumping off roof tops drunk after i do shots
Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two rotts
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizza's, now i got twelve visa's
So tell jesus I'm gonna quit sending when hell freezes

[chorus]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seemsshorter
But as the world turns and I keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over

Yo I use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap
I think i fucked my head up listing to acid rap
I go to party's bumping nasty nas's new song
And smoke pot till I get high and i stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced aint, it taste tainted
Your whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like sci-fi t.v
Fuck ICP buy my cd
cause while I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of mydebut
telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you
Aint no shame in my game I turn the party out
Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

[chorus]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seemsshorter
But as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over

Uh, uh uh uh uh
