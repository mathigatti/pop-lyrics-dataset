You think your going nowhere when your walking down the street 
acting like u just don't care when life could be so sweet 
so why you wana be like that 'cos this is nothing new 
your not fooling no one you're not even fooling you 
so walk a little slower and open up your eyes 
some times its so hard to see the good things passing by 
well there may never be a sign no flashing neon light 
i'm telling you to make your move or when the time is right so? 
Why not? (why not) 
take a crazy chance? 
Why not? 
do a crazy dance? 
it may take a little butt it may take a lot but why not? (why not?) 


You always dress in yellow when you wana dress in gold 
instead of listening to your heart you do just what your told 
well you keep waiting were you are 
no one will ever no 
so lets just get into your car and go babie go! 
so?..... 
Why not? (why not) 
take a crazy chance 
Why not do a crazy dance 
it may take a little but it may take alot 
but why not? why not 

ooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i could be the one for you 
ooooooohhhhhhhh yea maybe yes maybe no 
oooooohhhhhhhh it could be the thing to do 
all i'm saying is you gotta let me knowowo 
a a ya a a a ya ya ya 
a a ya ya a a yayaaaaaaa 
you'll never get to heaven or even to L.A 
if you don't beleive it theres a wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy 
why not? (take a star from the sky?) 
why not? (spread your wings and fly?) 
OH!!! 
it may take a little but it may take alot! 
but why not? 
why not?
