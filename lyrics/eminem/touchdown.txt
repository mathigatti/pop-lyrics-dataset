E-when we touchdown
T-in the midwest we ok
Every body know them southern boys love that bass
E-atlanta go bananas
Alabama, 'ouisiana, mississippi tenekee every mother
fuckin state
When we touchdown
T-go right from the plane
To the range
E-when we touchdown
T-on a private plane gettin brain 'til we
E-touchdown
There ain't no way to keep em quiet
With t.I. and shady baby, we bout to incite a riot
When we touchdown


[t.i.]
When we get in town
You know how we gettin down
Pull up clean and hop on out
Snatch all the freaks and walk on out
I'm livin what they talkin 'bout
Shinin if it dark or not
That 100 ex double r youll find that in the parkin
lot
You barkin up the wrong tree
I do this shit for zone 3
4,5 and 6 as well as 1
Atlanta i am forever son
Still be on whatever coast
Ridin blowin' heavy smoke
Em you better tell'em,
Folk won't hesitate to let'em go
They know i put that green light on them haters
Keep on tryin me ill put that beam right on ya ???
And you don't wanna see tip he outrageous
Try and keep him in a cage,
But some how he keep escapin
Thats why i be on vacation
Virgin islands i be takin
Private planes,out to spain
My g4 flyin i ain't fakin
The money ain't a thing,
Think I'm lyin you're mistaken
You can find long lines of all kinds of bitches
waitin

Chorus

[eminem]
Welcome to the midwest yes
Where them detroit playaz
Ball like you have no idea
Them boys here got the whole place
Lookin like its candy painted ain't it
Like we left the kids at home and just let'em loose
with the crayons
Fuck i just hit a jogger
People lookin like frogger
They hoppin outta the way
Whenever they see marhsall's car comin'
The kids painted my windows with black permanent
marker
And left the rest of the car covered colored like
swirl pops
And i got the base thumpin
But I'm bound to bump into somethin
Kids are flyin through the air lookin like theyre
crumpin
The way theyre tumblin
And i gotta do somethin
But as soon as i hit the car wash
To get the tar off,
Then its right back at it tomorrow
Theyre like, damn this is in
So get with the trend
This is for the pimps
Listenin to mims
Nail polish on the rims
And now its custom chrome
But i gotta go do a show
So go on with yah bad selves,
Just have it back to normal

Chorus

[t.i.]
From my arrival, to my departure
Guaranteed i put the d-i-c-k in somebodys daughter
Ã© i still have my way
With the ladies was cross the water
Flew to paris from haiti, this some shit that i
thoughta
Its ironic that this shit that we bobbin
Make us psychotic
It's a threat to corporate america
Thats why they runnin from it
How can they be so ignorant?
Look at what hip hop done done
It's allowed us to run a business
Legitimating our money
Got us outta the ghettos
And relocated our mommys
I made it all the way here,
No way u takin it from me
So excuse me oprah honey
I'm sorry really i promise
But niggas bitches and hoes do exist
I'm just bein honest
??? me bein punished
Why is you so astonished?
Nah i ain't got a degree just intelligence and a
bundle
Now u ain't gotta like me
I know millions of folk who love me
You can tell how they yellin and screamin and waitin
for me

Chorus
