People!! It feels so good to be back!
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the new and improved, you know who


Never been the type to bend or budge
the wrong button to push,no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese. I'm a pit bull
Off his leash, all this peace talk can cease

All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
Can-a-bitch don't want no beef with Slim? Noooo!

Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
from seance to seance, aw-a-aw-sh-a-aw

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back. Boo!
The boogie monster of rap, yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face in, push this generation

Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something
You might not like, this white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned

Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there

Yeah, you laugh till' your mutherfuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp thinkin' the crap can't happen
Till' you fuck around, get an anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrapping

Open the plastic and then you stand back gasping
Fuckin' assassins hijackin' Amtracks crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'

To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby, gettin' recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans
I'm twenty-eight, they're gonna take you 'fore they take me

Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more, or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me,stab me shoot me

Psychotic, hypnotic product I got it the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on/ and yada yada
God I talk a lot of hem de lay la la la
Oochie walla um da dah da dahda but you gotta gotta

Keep movin', there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock, and Hennessey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies

On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry, like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free

Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny
I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothing
I'm past bluffing, pass the K-Y
Let's get ready for some intense,serious ass fucking!

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Dr. Dre, wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas, wants tosquare dance with me
X to the Z, wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes, wants to square dance with me

Cana-bitch, won'tsquare dance with me
Fan-a-bitch, won't square dance with me
Canada-bis, don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen, wants tosquare dance with you
Yee-Haw!
