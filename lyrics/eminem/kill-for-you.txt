You gon' make me a believer, oh
Even if that shit ain't true, oh oh
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you


In my eyes
Even if you are wrong, you are right
Even if there is a terrible crime
It's alright, 'cause I got your back
And I know you got mine

I belong
To the church of your name, sing a song
'Cause I worship the ground you walk on
If I pray for you, I know you'll be there

You gon' make me a believer, oh
Even if that shit ain't true, oh oh
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

In my bed
I believe every word that you've said
Just a kiss and you make me forget
All the bad, the battles we lost, the bodies we hid

You don't know
Just how far I'd be willing to go
You put the cracks into my moral code
So you can count on me to always be there

You gon' make me a believer, oh
Even if that shit ain't true, oh oh
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

Oh, Lord, forgive my weary hands
And for what they may do
I'll carry out his evil plans
If he wants me to

In your dream, you're drowning, I just waltzed in and saved you
I'm your alternate escape route, the altar you pray to
Your ultimate savior, your behavior is altered
Ain't your fault, 'cause I made you
Brainwashed and persuade you

Gibraltar, you're faithful, never falter or waver
When you causing the danger, I'm your guardian angel
Nobody can tell you shit, you've already made your
Mind, just follow me, babe, you
Won't be sorry you stayed, you
Always ride, whatever the plan is
To the end, even if I led us into an ambush
Even if we robbed the First National and cops caught us redhanded
They're coming at us, and we're trapped, put our backs up
Against the wall, and it's too tall
You catapult me or hold the ladder for me
Stay back to get captured, take the fall
You make it all worth it
Baby doll, you're perfect the way you are
Accidents happen

All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal
Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
When they threaten, what we have it's a natural reaction
You lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
Who tries to take your man from you
It's blasphemy, another casualty, you'll go whatever route
Whatever you have to do, you blast for me
I never doubt that you

You gon' make me a believer, oh
Even if that shit ain't true, oh oh
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you
