You, I'm Eminem and I got sumthin to tell all you bitches!
I've created a monster cuz not body wants to c shady no more im chopped liver!
Chorus:
I wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
I wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
with you...with you (This world is only gonna break your heart) 
What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you 
Chorus:
I don't wanna fall in love no (This world is only gonna break your heart)
I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
with you 
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
Its strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I´d love somebody like you
I never dreamed that I´d lose somebody like you 
Chorus:
No I don't wanna fall in love
No I don't wanna fall in love
With you... with you 
Nobody else loves no one
