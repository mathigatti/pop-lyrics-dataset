This the calm before the storm right here
Wait, how was I gonna start this off? I forgot
Oh, yeah
That's an awfully hot coffee pot
Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not
But that's all I got 'til I come up with a solid plot
Got a plan, and now I gotta hatch it
Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk
I'ma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan
And say a prayer that every time Melania talks
She gets a mop--ahh, I'ma stop
But we better give Obama props
'Cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze
That'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust
And while the drama pops and he waits for sh*t to quiet down
He'll just gas his plane up and fly around 'til the bombing stops
Intensities heightened, tensions are rising
Trump, when it comes to giving a sh*t, you're stingy as I am
Except when it comes to having the balls to go against me, you hide 'em
'Cause you don't got the f*cking nuts like an empty asylum
Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for
'Cause that's how he gets his f*cking rocks off and he's orange
Yeah, sick tan, that's why he wants us to disband
'Cause he can not withstand
The fact we're not afraid of Trump
Fuck walkin' on egg shells, I came to stomp
That's why he keeps screamin': Drain the swamp
'Cause he's in quicksand
It's like we take a step forwards, then backwards
But this is his form of distraction
Plus, he gets an enormous reaction


When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that
Instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada
All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather
Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers
Then says he wants to lower our taxes
Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips
Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
Same sh*t that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered
Then does it more
From his endorsement of Bannon
Support from the Klansmen
Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black
And comes home from Iraq
And is still told to go back to Africa
Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa
Who keeps ignoring our past historical, deplorable factors
Now, if you're a black athlete
You're a spoiled little brat for tryna use your platform or your stature
To try to give those a voice who don't have one
He says: You're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards
Unless you're a POW who's tortured and battered
'Cause to him, you're zeros
'Cause he don't like his war heroes captured
That's not disrespecting the military
Fuck that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist
And keep that sh*t balled like Donald the bitch
He's gonna get rid of all immigrants
He's gonna build that thing up taller than this
Well, if he does build it, I hope it's rock solid with bricks
'Cause like him in politics, I'm using all of his tricks
'Cause I'm throwing that piece of sh*t against the wall 'til it sticks
And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his
I'm drawing, in the sand, a line
You're either for or against
And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split
On who you should stand beside
I'll do it for you with this
Fuck you!
The rest of America stand up
We love our military, and we love our country
But we f*cking hate Trump
