There you are,
holding her hand
i am lost,
dying to understand
didnt i,
cherish u right
dont u know,
u were my life.


CHORUS:
even though i try,
i cant let go
something in your eyes captures my soul
and everynight i see you in my dreams
you're all i know
i cant let go

VERSE 2:
just cast aside,
u dont even know i'm alive
u just walk on by,
don't care to see me cry
and here i am still holding on,
I cant accept my world is gone
no no...

CHORUS:
even though i try,
i cant let go,
something in your eyes captures my soul.
and everynight i see you in my dreams,
you're all i know,
i cant let go

BRIDGE:
do you ever realise,
the sorrow i have inside,
everyday of my life.
do you know the way it feels
when all your love just dies,
i try and try
to deny that i need you but still you remain on my mind

CHORUS:
even though i try,
i cant let go
something in your eyes captures my soul
and everynight i see you in my dreams
you're all i know
i can't let go...
