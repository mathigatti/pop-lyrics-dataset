(Suppose you were to die tonight.
What would you say?
Do you believe in life after death?)


In the chill of the night, 
I can feel my heart racing,
As I run towards the light, 
that seems so far away,
Wondering forever, in the darkest of shadows,
Wondering if I will ever see you again.

Wondering if I will ever see you again

I'll take your love (I'll take your love),
I'll take your hate (take your hate),
I'll take your desire.

I'll take the world,
When it turns on you (when it turns on you),
I'll set it afire.

(The walking dead, the walking dead.)

Digging in the dirt,
I can feel you getting closer,
Steadying my hands through the blistering pain,
Anxiously awaiting for the earth to reveal you,
Wondering if I will ever see you again.

Wondering if I will ever see you again.

I'll take your love (I'll take your love),
I'll take your hate (take your hate),
I'll take your desire.

I'll take your heart,
I'll take your pain (I'll take your pain),
I'll bring you to life.

I'll bring you to life...

(The walking dead, the walking dead.)

I'll bring you to life...

I'll take your love (I'll take your love),
I'll take your hate (take your hate),
I'll take your desire.

I'll take the world,
When it turns on you (when it turns on you).

(The walking dead, the walking dead.)

I'll take your love (I'll take your love),
I'll take your hate (take your hate),
I'll take your desire.

I'll take your heart,
I'll take your pain (I'll take your pain),
I'll bring you to life.
