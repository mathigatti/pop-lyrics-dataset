[T.I]
Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you dont call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight its over with" that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
goodnight it's over with thats all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote


I said It's over with thats all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight its over withâ€¦

[T.I Verse 1]
It's stupid how I go in knowing
Everybody knowing that i'm
Sewing up the game,
Strong like they hate me for it
Eventually see they cant beat than with me they join
Others sworn under oath,
Or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, n-gga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
It's on the fast track,
Ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at,
N-gga wishing it was this hot
Guess they mad at me huh,
Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone
High stepping prime time
Thought you n-ggas been on
Ain't no blocking my shine
Like my new air Yeezy's,
You can see me in the night time
You wanna hate, have a nice time
While I get stupid paper,
Hey my dough aint in its right mind
(mind, mind)

[Chorus]
Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you dont call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight it's over with thats all she wrote
all she wrote, all she wrote

[Eminem]
Man TIP told me on this hoe tip,
Best tip I could give you to hip you
Never let these traits trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, sh-t
Dig you a hole, take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Sh-t you talk about some adivce that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick,
It's you but f-ck 'em TIP, It's cold
it's chilling like a villain like the penguin in it's f-cking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in sh-t than fall in love with you
before I tie a f-cking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
you think this is some Nintendo game how f-cking dumb is you
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sum's with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts
But it won't buy you a chesseburger,
Although a nickle might just get you one pickle
F-ck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
That's a bombshell, scud missle!
I got this cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rap there was some motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So f-ck sissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister

[Chorus 2 - Eminem]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
It's never me to get the privilege to know 'em
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow

[T.I - Verse 3]
The credit roller,
Curtain closer, movie over with
But don't get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Ya life is sure a bitch
But she know I'm rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again,
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in
Peso, Euro, yeah, ah ha,
I'm paid never gon be poor again
See me posted in anything,
Wearing any chain
Never gon see me toting anything
All you gon see is BANG!
It's so nice where I kick it,
Hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level
But you n-ggas still can get it
It's all over 'fore you finish
Sorry bro this road we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business

[Eminem]
Yeah, I said I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now,
but in case you didnt
This is so bad, better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock comer racing in double time
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart like theres an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gon tell me that the A&amp;W
Ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg

[Eminem]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold

[T.I]
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight it's over with, thats all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote

[Eminem]
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Good night is over with thats all she wrote

[T.I]
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
I said its over with
That's all she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote
