I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
Yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta, 'til I graduated to one, and
Got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck, for respect if it
Meant life or death, never live to regret what I
Said, when you're me, people just want to see, if
It's true, if it's you, what you say in your
Rap's, what you do, so they feel, as part of your
Obligation to fulfill, when they see you on the
Streets, face to face, are you for real, in
Confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you
Killed, if you feel it, kill it, if you conceal
It, reveal it, being reasonable will leave you
Full of bullets, pull it, squeeze it, till it's
Empty, tempt me, push me, pussies, I need a good
Reason to give this trigger a good squeeze


I'm a soldier, these shoulder's hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up, I'm
A soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or
Crumble, I will never slip or stumble, I'm a
Soldier, these shoulder's hold up so much, they
Won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up, I'm a
Soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or
Crumble, I will never stumble

I love pissin' you off, it get's me off, like my
Lawyer's, when the fuckin' judge let's me off, all
You motherfuckers gotta do is set me off, I'll
Violate and all the motherfuckin' bet's be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do brings in news
Pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers, six-two
Who needs bullets, soon as I pull it, you sweat
Bullets, an excellent method to get rid of the
Next bully, it's actually better cause instead you
Murderin', you can hurt em' and come back again
And kick dirt at 'em, it's like pourin' salt in
The wounds, assault and get sued, you can smell
The lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops, all you
See is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot whether its your fault or not
'Cause

I'm a soldier, these shoulder's hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up, I'm
A soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or
Crumble, I will never slip or stumble, I'm a
Soldier, these shoulder's hold up so much, they
Won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up, I'm a
Soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or
Crumble, I will never stumble

I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin'
To 'em, give it back to these damn critics and
Sock it to em, I'm like a thug, with a little bit
Of Pac influence, I spew it, and look how I got
You bitches rockin' to it, you motherfuckers could
Never do it like I could do it, don't even try it
You'll look stupid, do not pursue it, don't ever
In your life, try to knock the truest, I spit the
Illest shit, ever been dropped to two inch, so
Ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart
Through this pen, motherfuckers know that I'll
Never be Marshall again, full of controversy until
I retire my jersey, 'til the fire inside dies and
Expires at thirty, and Lord have mercy on any more
Of these rappers that verse me, and put a curse on
Authorities in the face of adversity, I'm a

I'm a soldier, these shoulder's hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up, I'm
A soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or
Crumble, I will never slip or stumble, I'm a
Soldier, these shoulder's hold up so much, they
Won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up, I'm a
Soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or
Crumble, I will never stumble

Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left, yo'
Left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left, yo' left
Yo' left, yo' left, right, left, yo' left, yo'
Left, yo' left, right, left
