I love my job; it makes me feel like superman
Can you fly? I can, wanna see?Chorus: I am only entertaining you
my goal is to stimulate
Making you high and take you and I
To places you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm 
I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mum, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain youMy lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why constantly run back
To combat attacks, to constant concepts
From lyrics are constantly took out contexts
Failure to communicate with congresses
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
S*** I really should've fell but I stood 
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray, there's a light  
There's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide 
There'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children follow my lead and feel the vibe becauseChorusMy music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious
It might be confusing
Tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it, I get sick of tryin' to explain it
See I could sit and argue wit you but it goes beyond
Just bein' a snot pointy nosed bleach blonde
'Cause I came here to uplift let you woes be gone
Tell 'em to get f***ed and just mosey on
Constantly moving, constantly using the constitution
Here's a form of restitution 
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone rebuildin'
We're all revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim
How many kids'll copy? Probably millions
But I'm 'a do this is a f***ing hobby two thin 'causeChorusMy lyrical content contains subject matter that sucks
Suck all these f***ed up young kids out at alarmin' rate
Common denominate
Add it up and you'll see that's why I dominate 
I try to stimulate but kids emulate 
And mimic every move you make, Slim you great
But wait can't you see I'm only here to entertain
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cause may I see it, feel it, live it but it's inhumane 
For me to see you be influenced then pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I been through pain
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lustChorus
