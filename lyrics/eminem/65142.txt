America
(Hahaha)
We love you!
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours?!
The stripes and the stars for the rights
That men have died for to protect
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States
Government has sworn to uphold


(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)
Or so we're told

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfucking people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fucking army marching in back of me

So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Till it stays stuck in your head for days and days

Who would've thought, standing in this mirror bleaching my hair
with some peroxide reaching for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this

I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
'Cause congress keeps telling me I ain't causing nothing but problems
And now they're saying I'm in trouble with the government
I'm loving it, I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumping it on

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White america, I could be one of your kids
White america, little Eric looks just like this
White america, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew, Shady's dimple's would help
Make ladies swoon baby, (ooh baby), look at my sales

Let's do the math, if I was black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic, show me where the fucking studio's at

When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
Fuck it, until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance, and I lit a fire up under his ass

Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like, damn, we just swapped, sitting back looking at shit, wow
I'm like, my skin, it's starting to work to my benefit now, it's

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White america, I could be one of your kids
White america, little Eric looks just like this
White america, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

See the problem is, I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would of never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Till I created so much motherfucking turbulence

Straight out the tube, right into your living room I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them

That's why they put my lyric's up under this microscope
Searching with a fine tooth comb, its like this rope
Waiting to choke, tightening around my throat
Watching me while I write this, like, I don't like this, nope

All I hear is lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working
'Round the clock to try to stop my concerts early, surely hip-hop
Was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom

So now I'm catching the flack from these activists when they ragging
Acting like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch, or say "faggot"
Shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfucking spokesman now for

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White america, I could be one of your kids
White america, little Eric looks just like this
White america, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
And piss on the lawns of the white house
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of in this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you ms. Cheney
Fuck you tipper gore
Fuck you with the freest of speech this divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you!

Hahaha, I'm just playing, America, you know I love you
