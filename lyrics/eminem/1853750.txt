[Stat Quo - Chorus]
Im the next one next one
Motherf-ckers can't f-ck with me with me
Got a problem shorty come get me, get me
Nah I ain't Dr. Dre nah I ain't Eminem or 50
Dog I'm Stat


[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
As I think back retract
From the classroom to the trap
Freida's only son had to hustle for scraps
It's hard to relax when your wage minimum being broke
F-ck with my adrenaline before Dre and Eminem
I was tryna get on demo tapes state to state
Performing at clubs and doing whatever it takes
Relying on faith hoping my dreams take shape
And my fate meeting (?)
I would wait for these A&amp;R's say I ain't grind bitch
Spending my last dime on this studio time sh-t
A lot of folk told me I was stupid for tryin' this
Situation crucial feds off in my climate
Home environment taking pictures of me it was ugly
The spot got hot scene felt like curry
Had my vision blurry to underground Atlanta
Hit the streets me and Zeke put a plan together
Shorty it's now or never down to do whatever
You see the rainfall came but I had to bear that weather
Look your boy need cheddar like a mill or better
I was fed up but the benefit was worth the effort

[Stat Quo]
I'm patiently waiting used to get love
Now the same n-ggas hating wanna give me slugs
Partner don't get it separated or twisted you cant fade it
Stat's the wrong motherf-cker to play with understand me

[Eminem]
If you opened up your ears long enough to listen
you may hear what you have been missing
out all of this time I've been put in a position
to put all this in position
so quit your bitching
learn how to rhyme
get signed and get your shine

It's like this and like that 'n' ah
Welcome to Statlanta
Shady Aftermath 'n' uh
my brand new rapper from Atlanta
who goes by the name of Stat Quo
introducing our new excuse to keep producing
continue to do music use it and expand it
and make rap grow
the hottest new sh-t on the planet on the new plateau
but don't confuse it you don't understand it
lemme break it down for you to show you how we do sh-t
so that you cats know
this is Statlanta 101 cuz we don't want noone
walking out this mothaf-cka'
with tunnel vision to anyone with questions you want answer
just ask and we'll try to unmask 'em and maybe explain why so few cats blow just spit the truth when you get in this booth
and do that dough
that there boy (?)
you already knew that though, is he the greatest
from the ATL we got haters all day to debate us
so we'll just say this its water from a ducks back (?)
Go

[Stat Quo]
I got caviar (?) box chevy dreams
CD covers, TV screens
the booth or the block might go to triple beam
Im'a make it right, hear me, huh huh
f-ck what your saying God put me here to shine
(?) white collar crime
the rhyme or the crime, MPC or the nine
I'ma make it, I need my huh huh
I couldn't care less, f-ck y'all

The A-Town (?)
didn't no other label offer me no deal
til they found out Shady aftermath was interested
then they started to beg (?)
this aint no gimmick this the south and I be that kid

the piece of the puzzle that fit, it's Stat Quo son of a b-tch

[Stat Quo - Chorus]
