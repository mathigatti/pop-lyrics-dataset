In Love I just wanna hold my baby high above
I want this hand in its rightful glove
have people saying god damn shes fine
me responding with damn right shes mine
Even though your gone, I try and carry on
Its sad but its true, me and you
were through
but people still think they know us and they dont know shit
but i want you to know im sorry and i still love you britt
but now ive come to see, our destiny will never fit
and thats why now i look back being once lost then found
Its getting tougher with you not around
your the only thing that got me to smile
i guess our love was a truthful denile
sometimes i remenice at what we had
not knowin i was causing my baby to be sad
I never once tried to cause you this pain
its crazy how one person can make u go insane
Ill admit me and you we had our bad times
we fought, yea but people act like its a fuckin crime
no couples perfect, everyone faces bullshit
all i ever tried was to show you i loved you britt
but its sad cause the image i portray the pieces dont fit
All this time how could it be, my destiny will never be you and me
But i wish people could see, how much im so crazy
in love with you, its true i wish it was still me and you
doin what we use to do, i wish they really knew
and i wish theyd know id never let anything bad happend to you
i got your back to the fullest, baby nems one to stay truest
but times were tough, and shit got rough
every other day same shit breakin up and we fought
But just know britt my rhymes are true
Britt please know ill forever Love you
It just sucks cause theres a few out there that got Nems back
people always tellin me get your fuckin life on track
But in order to do that i need you back
and thats why you dont know what you got till its gone
Im so sorry that our love was always off and on....
