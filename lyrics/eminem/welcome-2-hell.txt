Eminem
Yeah, told you we'd be back
Welcome 2 Hell


There's a switch, I flip, emotions
Cut off
So cold I done froze my butt off
And this ain't even the tip of the
Iceberg yet
It's like squirting a squirt gun in
The ocean, fuck off
Other words I didn't put a dent
In a can compared to the
Damage I've yet to do
Long as you still have feelings to
Hurt, I'll be around as long as you
Let me get to you
Long as I got two balls to palm,
I'll be the bomb, you're just a
False alarm
Get scared little pissants, and see
If I don't come along and stop
Your farm
Thunder and lightning, rain, hail,
Sleet with a tornado's the kind of
Brainstorm I get
So when the wind starts
Blowing, shit, talking about goin'
In?
Goin' insane's more like it!
Wizard of words when he he
Spits hazardous with it
Like a disastrous blizzard so you
Better listen quick fast don't miss
It
Yeah go ahead little prick
Bastard, diss it
But when you get hit with a sick
Ass explicit flow
Don't ask how much of his
Passion is it that goes
Just know, that all he knows is
This
It's better to kick ass than kiss it
Dick dastardly of audacity mental
Capacity
Unmatched it has to be stopped
But it can't be, but man I can't
Just keep doing them like that
Or no one will rap with me
'Cept one, you asked who is it?

Guess who just came through
The blast, you bitches
With the ratchet, the book of
Mathew, a book of matches
Lightning, I'm ? white linen
You about to have to admit it
They pass you the mic, asked you
To spit it
You got handed your own ass,
Your ass in your own hands
Sure they gonna laugh when you
Go the bathroom with it
Now with what would you come
Against us?
Better be something with a big
Foot pedagree
Easily these are the reasons that
We need to be in your prayers
Each region breed some emcees
That wanna be, which means
They wanna breath our air
With these ideas, anybody
Thinkin' that the game don't
Need
The bad and the evil regime
That's like saying that bad boy
Piston team didn't need Isaiah

Sip piss and bleed, this is a
Different breed of emcees, I
Swear
Better be aware, there's too
Much at stake, and to find
Someone this raw on a beat is
Rare
You can kiss my ass and the shit
Stains on my underwear that I
Don't even wear

This gotta be no fair, this like
Hittin' the lottery, oh yeah
Who you know hotter? There
Gotta be no pair
Shotty that I got a lobotomy, your
Hair
Classic, smack it, smother it, read
It and weep and perhaps you'll
Have no rebuttalin'
In fact, you seein' me in this rap
Is like saying Tila Tequila can sing
Like Jasmin Sullivan

Back to badge her skull again,
Push a bitch out the Aston until I
Get the fuck outta dodge
Shouldn't have to explain my
Metaphors, ? color books that
Ain't colored in
Second and third, fourth wind,
Gotta another win
Here they come again, none
Other than, Bad and Evil
Also known as Sadam and Osama
Bin
It's been a long time, but I bet
Neither one of us have felt as sick
As we do right now
And we only get iller with time,
Me and Nickel fucking shit up on
The grounds
Tellin' us to pipe down, it's like
Talking to a meth head (get it?
Pipe? meth head? oh hilarity!)
Bruce Willis on his death bed, last
Breath with an infection
Fightin' it while he's watching
Internet porn, about to meet his
Death with an erection
My god, what I mean is, David
Carrideine jacking his penis in
Front of his tripod
Choking his own neck, what part
You don't get?
I'm saying I die hard!

When you listen to my bars,
Nothin' but the F-I-R...E
Comin' out your iPod, we come
Up in a place
Chicks heads start spinning like
Motherfuckin' white walls

Got your mother suckin' my balls
While we fuck each other, punch
Each other in the eyeballs
And I never say I'm sor...ry, the
5'9 and the Fire Marshall
We spit with an intensity to shut
Shit down in the industry
Two different entities, with a
Propensity to put these N-U-T-S
