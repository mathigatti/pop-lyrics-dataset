[Chorus]
Jingle bells jingle bells. Jingling all the way 
Oh what it is to ride from Detroit to east LA                 

[Verse 1]
Is this a white Christmas hell no my man 
Imp leaving blood in the snow and smacking
Fat man. You mean Santa that boys a bitch 
He cot my mom Christmas Eve and tried to give her a kiss.
For real it's no joke the guy don't play he tried to fuck way more
Then a one horse slay laughing all the way but he's not laughing today
Well jingle mothering even the elves will pay.
Come Christmas Eve oh nick's a goner will be
Snackin on dear even blestin and downer
Not a question went not even a maybe

Give a new meaning to hoho shack that ass girl bumpin 
Booty in the snow. So watch out Santa You jolly old troll we'll be 
Stripin that slay and leave you the coal

Jingle bells jingle bells. Jingling all the way 
Oh what it is to ride in a drop top shavola  "hey"
Jingle bells jingle bells. Jingling all the way 
Oh what it is to ride from Detroit to east LA  

[Verse 2]
You playin reindeer games hell yeah my friend 
Grab Rudolph's horns and see how far the bend
When he's nose turns red he's dick gets back out
My friend. Yeah sants clues wouldn't list me as nice
In fact he add me listed as nottie twice
Not cuz of the fights or the Christmas gifts hast
It's cuz of all the shit I left on he's wife
It's time for Old Nick to move very far before we roast he's
nuts on a big ass fire

I mean your ass is huge loss 
Weight for real dude. Cookies in mouth simply 
Quit sick. I mean when's the last time u seen 
Your dick. And im not one to bitch but every year
