We Ain't
(feat. Eminem)


[Intro]
Ladies and gentleman
You are now about to witness the strength
Of Aftermath straight out the mothafuckin streets of Compton
Put your hands together for Game b!tch
Hahahaha
Yeah mothafuckas
Compton's back on the mothafuckin map
Aftermath in that ass bitch
Game let's go

[Verse 1 - The Game]
Me and Marshall ain't start shit they listen to our shit
They talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But its hard when they hate us and think 'Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them, 
Shady one of the greatest like Biggie n' Pac was 
We started throwin cinthi and decided to chase 'em
Me, him and 50 racin' this rap shit is basic I followed that Jay shit
Thinkin what I wanna say, step in the booth in one take and
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical LA, NWA shit
The media is bullshit now we can't even say bitch
They accusin Michael of touchin kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin' I can taste this swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and wast 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired this black shit this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this

[Chorus:]
[The Game]
So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
[Eminem]
This day the game won't ever be the same
[Dre]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
[Eminem]
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power

[Verse 2 - Eminem]
Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm making
If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame
Your mind's lost, you are not ready to make that flame switch
You will end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face
Which- way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waiving in my face
Looking for answers, rap sensation Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted
The Mask of Jason was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting too much time
Me no kiss ass, and if that's the case, then we ain't going...

[Chorus:]
[The Game]
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
[Eminem]
This day the game won't ever be the same
[Dre]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
[Eminem]
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power

[Verse 3 - The Game]
Low get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Eminem just killed me on my own shit
I'm walking through 8 mile, startin' to get home sick
I'ma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted
If Eminem is anybody on my under the pennalton
These niggas is killing it take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimmy Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For tellin me its hot when its not and you got what you got
From them rocks on the block, you can stop tellin Dre you got shot
With a glock that don't phase me, 
I'm crazy why you think I'm rhyming with Shady ?
I don't care if the radio don't play me, I say what I say when I feel like I'm feelin today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks

[Chorus]
So I'm gone bitch
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
[Eminem]
This day the game won't ever be the same
[Dre]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
[Eminem]
The game just isn't the same its changin
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power
