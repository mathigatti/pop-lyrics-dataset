Lets get down to business, 
I dont got no time to play around, what is this? 
What is this? 
It's the invasion! The infiltration! We commin! 
I got 50 cent, I got G-unit. 
D-twizzy in this bitch with Obie Trice 
So watch what you say 'fore you call our name. 
Cuz you say one more thing and it wont be nice 
Here we go, 
I shoulda known 
I was bound to get pulled 
into some bullshit 
sooner or later. 
You little haters 
are to jealous of us to love us,you hate it 
G-unit made it 
and Obie's comin' 
D-twizzy's comin' 
youre sick to your stomach. 
50 percent of it's 50 cent, 
the other 50 percent of it's 
whos color of skin it is. 
But if youre even considerin' 
takin our label down 
youd better find our building 
and fly a fuckin plane into it. 
But i aint tryin' to get to intricate into it, 
im just tryin' to give you a little hint 
for your own benefit. 
Cuz then its gonna get to the point 
where it escalates into some other shit 
then im'a flip, 
then im'a get to 
stompin in my air force ones, 
wont be able to tell if its 
two pairs or its one. 
Cuz its gon' feel like 
so many feet kickin' 
you'll think nike just made these into cleats in the shoe. 
I dont know what it is or what it could be 
but i get a woody 
when these pussies try to push me. 
Thinkin' they gon' put me in a position to pickle me. 
Y'all tickle me pink, 
I think i'd just rather have pink tickle me (hehehe). 
Hickory dickory dock 
tickety tock tickety. 
A little bit of the diggety dock diggety, 
mixed with a little bit of the jigga ch jigga 
with a small pinch of biggie 
look at me im just the bomb diggedy! 


(CHORUS) 
We the realest label, 
dont try to act like you dont feel our label 
cuz' we gon' fuck around and kill your label 
Obie, D-twizzy, G-unit, 50, Shady Records 
we the label fo sho! 
we the realest label 
dont try to act like you dont feel our label 
cuz we gon' fuck around and steal yo' people 
Obie, D-twizzy, G-unit, 50
