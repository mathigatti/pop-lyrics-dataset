Why did you say,that forever's dead and gone?
And that you,are through with me,too?
Sometimes I ask myself,do I need some help,
But then you'd just ask me to leave you


Don't hurt me baby,I just can't bear the pain
Don't hurt me,like I've Been hurt before
So I,try to see,the way you feel for me
please don't hurt me baby
