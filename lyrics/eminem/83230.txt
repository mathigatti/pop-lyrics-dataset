[Eminem]
I don't know dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because...


CHORUS [Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Eminem]
So I get off stage right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
"What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D-12 baby"
They're all like "Oh my God it's him"
"Becky oh my fucking God it's Eminem"
"I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock"
"Please won't you please let me suck your cock"
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and the panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'cause they're back on stage the next night with me
"Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me"
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

Chorus

My band (9x)

[Swifty]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you?
Hey dad how come we don't rap on proto
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
And what the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'cause my shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, it's simple but
all I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while get whipped on my back

[Kuniva] Look him little punk ass thinking he the shit
[Kon Artis] Yeah I know man find himself taking on a flick
[Kuniva] Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
[Eminem] No! I had an interview, not you two
[Kuniva] You gonna be late for soundcheck
[Kon Artis] Man I ain't going to soundcheck
[Kuniva] But our mics are screwed up
[Kon Artis] And his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say something
[Kuniva] Aiyo Em (You got somethin' to say?!)
[Kon Artis] Man no
[Kuniva] I thought you 'bout to tell him off, man what's up
[Kon Artis] Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
[Kuniva] Man I was 'bout to talk right after you I swear, I swear man

Chorus

[Proof]
They say the lead singer's rock, but the group is not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement parks
I'ma go let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear... (Hey dude I love your band!)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys they can find every area code (Proof carry my bag)
Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)

[Bizarre]
God damn it I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loop
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artis, slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video, I was in the back
Superman video, I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us a question
Like who's D-12, how we get started (But what about Eminem?)
Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy)
Then he told me to do sit-ups to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D-12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

[Eminem]
Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me
and it just tares my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

[Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (haha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
'cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man (yeah)
All because I'm the lead singer...

[Eminem] My band (9x)

[Bizarre] (In background)
The hottest boy band in the world
D12!

[Eminem] (as a salsa singer)
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girl's to take off their underpants
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girl's want to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called "My Salsa"
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa
Where'd everybody go?
