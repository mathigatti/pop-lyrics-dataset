(Intro)
Yeah... haha, you feel that baby? Yeah I feel it too
Damn... you know, I'm so glad we can spend this time together
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I? haha


(Verse 1)
I'm the American dream, I'm the definition of white trash ballin'
I'm right back on 'em with the (scratches)
I can't call it, same shit different toilet
Oh yeah, got a nice ass darling
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I must've got my pimpin' jeans from him, the way he left my momma
I'ma rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as... me, I'm as calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs and his arms
I'm a superstar, girl I'm ready for ya momma
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pyjamas

(Hook)
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

(Verse 2)
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo
First to kiss you naval, work my way down
Baby you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find something more stable
I told ya I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April
But thankyou for staying April
I'mma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phoney lil fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggie bear, and all the kissy-face please
Initiate phase three, missy now service me
Take another shot of jeiger, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, oh you're the bomb baby
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mum lady
I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding witcha
Got a twisted sense of humour, it's warped but I didn't hit ya
I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm just

(Hook)
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

(Bridge)
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite.. so!
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite.. so!
I can hold you in the morning, but in the evening, I gotta go
Cause I'm on to the next girl, and the next girl, I kinda like oh, oh, oh

(Verse 3)
I got you caught up in the rapture
Make you recapture the feelings you had for
Your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad ya
Sweating, but If I'm what you wanted
Why'd you panic when I grabbed ya
Girl don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of something this so organic
You can't ignore it so just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
Damn shawty, I told you this is bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back and
Throw your spine out of alignement
My love has got you so blind
That you couldn't pick anyone else out of a line up
So stop with the stall, pick your pint up
Let's get the pineapple snapz going
No one'll knock cause I'm gonna hang a sign up
Saying don't disturb, shawty I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

(Hook)
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

(Bridge)
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite.. so!
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite.. so!
I can hold you in the morning, but in the evening, I gotta go
Cause I'm on to the next girl, and the next girl, I kinda like oh, oh, oh

(Hook)
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

(Outro)
Haha, Dr. Dre... 2010, lightyears ahead of you... woooo!
