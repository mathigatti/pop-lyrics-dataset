[Intro] (Bizarre)
The Rap Game 
Hip-hop 1-0-1 
The hardest 9 to 5 you will ever have 
You can't learn this shit in no history-book 
You ready to rap mothafucker? 
You ready to sell your soulâ€¦ gheh-gheh-gheh 
`The Rap Game` ...motherfucker 


[Verse 1] (Swifty) 
I'm a disruptive nigger. You made me crazy 
You should a slayed me as a baby 
Behavin shadier than Wes Craven 
And you aint even gotta pay me 
I take pleasure of layin a nigga down daily 
You face me drunk of sober. You'll faint fast 
I'm never fucked up to where I can't whoop your ass 
Your neck will get snapped wit bear hands fuck music 
Is he rappin is cool but fool don't confuse it 
What happens these dudes get rude and then I lose it 
Im scantlas 
I blow your two kids off the atlas 
With a gat that's bigger 
Then Godzilla's back nigga 
You are not real and in fact 
Your fruity effect of a crack dealer 
Yall president sends me smack 
Den got a mack 10 wit it 
So I aint gotta rap 
But im thankful for that 
dont mistaken me black 
Or u be stankin in back of a fuckin caddillac 

(Eminem) 
I'ma get snuffed 
Cause I aint said enough to pipe down 
I pipe down when the white house is whipped out 
when I see that lil cheany dike get snipped out 
lights out bitch adios goodnight 
now put that in your lil pipe and bite down 
think for a minute cause the hype has died down 
that I wont go up in the oval office right now 
and flip whatever ain't tied down upside down 
I'm all for America, fuck the government 
tell that C. Doloris Tucker slut to suck a dick 
mutha fucker duck what the fuck son of a bitch 
take away my gun and I'm a tuck some other shit 
cant tell me shit about the tricks of this trade 
switch blade with a lil switch to switch blades 
switch from a 6 to a 16 inch blade 
shits like a samurai sword a sensei 
shit just don't change to this day 
im this way still till I utslay itchbay 
ucksay my ickday 
scuse my igpay atinlay 
but uckfay a igpay 

[Chorus] (50 Cent) 
this rap game

I aint sellin my soul for this rap game 
I aint digging a whole for this rap game 
but im telling ya no it aint happ-ning

I aint sellin my soul for this rap game 
I aint digging a whole for this rap game

[Verse 2] (Kon Artis)
I bet you rather me drink n drown in my own eniquity 
but fuck that ima rap till u all get sick of me 
and clutch my nut sack and spit on who pick on me 
im hittin a rock next fuck a dogg who sickin me 
im sayin you mutha fuckers dont know and quit playin 
if im broke then im brakin open the place where you layin 
you know, same shit every nigga done in his life 
i lived it thats why i speak on what i want when i write 
so why... should i... ever fear another man
if he bleed like i bleed take a piss an he stand 
ok, you win... you can say we cant rap 
but no source never mean we aint buyin on what they say is wack 

(Kuniva) 
I walk in the party and just start bustin 
right after i hear the last verse im self-destruction 
this liquor make me wanna blast the chrome 
to let you know that time without more is getting jerome 
im low down and shifty, quickly called swifty 
to do a drive by on a 10-speed with "50" 
you feelin lucky? squeeze 
i catch you outside of chucky cheese 
well just see, who be an unlucky G 
my life style is unstable, a partyin attic 
they said no fighting in the club so i brought me a matic 
coughin estatic, I jump niggas call me a rabbit 
popin a tablet, and guns that saw you in half 

(50 cent)
Beleive me. We run this rap shit fo shizzie 
make makin millions look easy 
every where ya turn you see me 
you hear me. Believe me 
for ya see my pistol in 3-D 
no time to call a peace treaty 
dial 9-1-1 cause u need de
police to help you believe me 

(Proof)
I snatch the tounge from the sidewalk and piss on the curb 
this is absurb 
these street niggas twistin my words 
we finally could 
say goodbye to hollywood 
cause proof an shaun 
share nuttin in common 
the nastyest band 
with gats in each hand 
we never bomb down to be a flash and a pan 
no remorse 
fuck you stature dog 
nuttin to do wit hands when i clap at yall 
put ya jaw on the ground 
wit the 4 and a pound 
im goin out of town 
for the long come around 
so we can battle wit raps 
so we can battle wit gats 
matter fact we can battle wit plaques

(Bizarre) 
I'm too fuckin retarded 
i dont give a fuck about my dick thats why im dating Loraina Bobbet 
my crew had an argument 
who was the largest 
now they all is dead 
and im rolling as a solo artist 
plus i made all the beats and wrote all the raps 
well i really didnt 
but i did according to this contract 
i was stoned in the snow 
wit no where to go 
freezin 20 below 
forced to join bail tip dafoe 
my little girl she shouldnt be listening to these lyrics 
thats why i glued the headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it 
if rap dont work, im starting a group wit garth brooks (hahhaha) 
50 sing the hook 

[Chorus] (50 Cent)

I aint sellin my soul for this rap game 
I aint digging a whole for this rap game 
And im telling ya no it aint happ-ning

I aint digging a whole for this rap game
