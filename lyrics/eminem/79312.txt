I'm watching myself cry
Well I just sighed my last sigh
And I took you by surprise
So why apologize
'cause I will always find my wayI think I've found the way
So stay
You can make my day
And I'm
Stopping my demise
And I apologize
I really need to find my wayYou can see
What it will be
Time honoured questions
Love in dimensions
As it was
You can see
What it will be
Finding suggestions
Lasting impressions
As it was
But until I find you there
I will swear
Tot take care
And I'm fighting a war for youI'm trying to comply
But I'm just a passer by
And I sometimes I'm unwise
But see life through my eyes
'cause I will always find my wayYou can see
What it will be
Time honoured questions
Love in dimensions
As it was
You can see
What it will be
Finding suggestions
Lasting impressions
As it was
But until I find you there
I will swear
Tot take care
And I'm fighting a war for you
