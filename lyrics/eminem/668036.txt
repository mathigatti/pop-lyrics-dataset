(Chorus)
If I cant shoot you,
ima have to kill u by spittin, 
battlin mothafuckers my ruckus aint written,
when my bullets miss,
my words keep hittin, 
if u like pain, 
then that's wut u gettin, 


We up on the stage u getting all nervous, 
ima get rid of you, 
now how u like my service, 
u see me up here, 
devil without a purpose, 
please step back, 
and watch me as I work this, 
if I had a rating, 
my style would be perfect, 
cuz in the rap game, 
everything is worth it, 
wherever u go, u have to cause a scene, 
ur dirty, u should try the washing machine, 
all ur clothes are all stained up full of cum, 
that's why u should wash them, 
man ur so dumb, man ur so stoopid, 
brain fulla looped-shit, 
u think ur all romantic, u think ur cupid, 
u think ur hot, u think ur cute shit, 
but the thing is, ur just a new kid, 
I got 130 seconds to spit at ur face, 
not too fast though, I gotta keep a steady pace, 
ill smack ur face way back to last place, 
u better try hard, this'll be ur last race, 
the last guy, shit man I licked him, 
u better watch out, ur my next victim, 

(Chorus)
If I cant shoot you,
ima have to kill u by spittin, 
battlin mothafuckers my ruckus aint written,
when my bullets miss,
my words keep hittin, 
if u like pain, 
then that's wut u getting, 
If I cant shoot you,
ima have to kill u by spittin, 
battlin mothafuckers my ruckus aint written,
when my bullets miss,
my words keep hittin, 
if u like pain, 
then that's wut u getting, 

im awesome, I rap with adrenaline, 
I don't care about this bitch, yeah im killin him, 
he cant rap worth shit, 
theres no will in him, 
hes eating my words, hope its fillin him,
now listen to wut
I instill in him, 
fear, 
I switch gears 
so fast its killin him (record scratches)
im awesome, good on all cylinders, 
don't matter if its a bitch, im still killin her, 
this bitch cant rap at all, there's no will in her, 
shes eating my words, hope its fillin her, 
now listen to
wut, 
I instill in her, 
fear, 
I switch gears so fast, 
its killin her, 
u so skinny, 
u can hide behind a flagpole, 
ur so fat, 
u could probably eat a fag, whole, 
u walk around, with ur pants sagged low, 
ur lifes over, time to put it in the bag bro, 
when its ur turn I know ur gonna freeze, 
all of a sudden, it's a hundred degrees, 
theres been a forest of chokers, u'll just add to the trees, 
feel so bad u'll wish u were overseas, 
wheres southwest when u really need it, 
I come wit a warning label, bitch cant u read it, 
u'll wanna stand up, ill keep you seated, 
don't understand? Want me to repeat it, 
u cant touch me, im too hot to handle, 
u see that, I burned u like a candle, 
the words gonna spread fast like the Monica Lewinsky scandal, 
any word I say, it's the work of a vandal, 
man Randle listen to wut I say, 
u panhandle and ur gay, its ok, 
urs shits so gray, 
ur words r dead, 
maybe itd be better if u'd just shoot urself in the head, 
fill ur brain with lead, 
but don't say I led ur brain to it, 
tell em u finally thought 'im insane, screw it," 
tell em before u did it everybody already knew it 
would happen, 
so dude just stop rappin, 
when ur on the mic, everybody's laughin, 
and by the time ur off, everybody's nappin, 
and when im on, everybody's clappin, 
this shits almost done, I just gotta cap it, 
this battles a tall fence, u cant hop it, 
my raps off the wall, u cant top it, 
so good bye nice try, im outta time, 
I left u behind with a whole mountain to climb

(Chorus)
If I cant shoot you,
ima have to kill u by spittin, 
battlin mothafuckers my ruckus aint written,
when my bullets miss,
my words keep hittin, 
if u like pain, 
then that's wut u getting,
If I cant shoot you,
ima have to kill u by spittin, 
battlin mothafuckers my ruckus aint written,
when my bullets miss,
my words keep hittin, 
if u like pain, 
then that's wut u getting, 

Wit one rhyme I terrorize a mind, 
get rid of their ego and carry out a crime, 
wit one line I lead one to demise, 
bury their lives, 
and watch them, as they internally cry, 
externally die, 
leave them eternally scarred, eternally marred, 
and after its all over, I send them a card, 
as soon as im up on the stage im fulla rage,
like a tiger in his cage, 
ready to engage, 
in a fight, ready to bite, 
ready to turn a page, 
and ready to do it every night, 
ready to burn his rage, im ready, 
just gimme the mic, 
and watch me strike, 
my words are like magic, 
some endings are tragic, 
they remember me for years, 
my lines are classic, 
u don't wanna battle me, 
ur shakin, 
so go home and bake urself some bacon, 
I got three breasts under my chest, 
but I don't understand why im under arrest, 
im on a quest, to destroy everything in my way, 
and if ur with me, than lemme hear u say...

(Chorus)
If I cant shoot you,
ima have to kill u by spittin, 
battlin mothafuckers my ruckus aint written,
when my bullets miss,
my words keep hittin, 
if u like pain, 
then that's wut u getting, 
If I cant shoot you,
ima have to kill u by spittin, 
battlin mothafuckers my ruckus aint written,
when my bullets miss,
my words keep hittin, 
if u like pain, 
then that's wut u getting, 
(repeats to end)
