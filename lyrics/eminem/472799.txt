Im Taking My Time,
Im Trying To Leave The Memories Of You Behind,
Im Gonna Be Fine, As Soon As I Get Your Picture Right Off Of MyMind


CHORUS:
I Wanna Feel The Way You Make Me Feel When Im With You,
I Wanna Be The Only Hand You Need to Hold On To,
But Every Time I Call You Dont Have Time,
I Guess I'll Never Get To Call You Mine.

Youre Nothing At All
I Know Theres A Million Reasons Why I Shouldnt Call
With Nothing To Say,
Could Easily Make This Conversation Last All Day

Chorus

Another best friend
I couldn't get it to learn
You're my obsession
I got nowhere to turn.

I Wanna Feel The Way You Make Me Feel When Im With You,
I Wanna Be The Only Hand You Need to Hold On To,

I Wanna Feel The Way You Make Me Feel When Im With You,
I Wanna Be The Only Hand You Need to Hold On To,

I Wanna Feel The Way You Make Me Feel When Im With You,
I Wanna Be The Only Hand You Need to Hold On To,

But I Guess Ill Never Get To Call You Mine..
