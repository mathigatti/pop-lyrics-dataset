My heart is telling me to be different
Its about time for me to move on
Swallow everything, that i learned
I'm at a point of no return
(no return x7)
I'm at a point of no return.


Man it feels like these walls are closing in, this roof is caving in,
Oop its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in my book
Of rhymes got em cookem boy
This crooked mind of mine got em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes,
I stole that f*ckin clock, i took the time and i came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up and butt f-cked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up f*ck this fame
That aint what i came to claim, but the game aint gonna be the same
On the day that i leave it
I swear one way or another i'ma make these f-ckin haters believe it,
I swear to god wont spear the rod, i'm a man of my word
So your f*ckin heads better nod
Im gonna f*ck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your head will lie,
Permanently bi*ch it's beddy-bye,
This world is my easter egg, yeah, prepare to die'
My head is swoll
My confidence is up
This stage is my pedastal
Im unstoppable the incredible hulk
Your trapped in my medicine ball
I can run circles around you so fast your f*ckin head will spin dog,
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, i'll f-ckin

My heart is telling me to be different
Its about time for me to move on
Swallow everything, that i learned
I'm at a point of no return
(no return x7)
I'm at a point of no return.

One thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain
And i swear i got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me i know better than that it's just game
It's just what comes from fame
And i'm ready for that i'm just saying
I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But i'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So i'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me can you see me get your visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture
Turn your wide screen on
If you thinking i'm gonna quit before i die dream on
Man they treat me like a legend
Am i really this cold
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it who you kidding man
Nobody's ever done it like i did it

My heart is telling me to be different
Its about time for me to move on
Swallow everything, that i learned
I'm at a point of no return
(no return x7)
I'm at a point of no return.

I'm hot motherfucker, get a plate bitch
Don't say shit, get your face lift
Rozay bitch let the champagne drip
Niggas swag jack, but this l.a. shit
Get it back, give it back ain't 'bout shit
Snap back them ain't even rare where the tag a what
Wack ass all up in my ear bitch bag back
I bag bad bitches motherfucker kat stacks
Yellow nigga, no cabs
Got the phantom out, no mats
Get your camera out uh, one flash
Hot beams steady shot clap your ass
Aw, t. raw i'm so uh
Loc's on, chucks low, black beanie dog
Patron top wash straight from the liquor store
I'm turned up i can't feel my face so

My heart is telling me to be different
Its about time for me to move on
Swallow everything, that i learned
I'm at a point of no return
(no return x7)
I'm at a point of no return.
