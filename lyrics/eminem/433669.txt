No, I don't guess
I don't sacrifice
And I know
I don't realize
Just how much
I can idolize ... and I know
And then I find it falls back on
On to me, to see, believe
And down onto you, We do, it's true
And I won't beg to stay, to leave, or to believe
A word you say, and then I guess
It all falls back on you
To find out (find out)
What's the deal
And I guess you don't
Simplify
It's just, you had to
Had to take, and I knowThere's a fine line between right and wrong
And I know we knew all along
Just how much I can half belong ... and I know
And then I find out it all falls back on you
Cause I'm really up on this
Cause I've seen it before
Where the hell did I get through you?
