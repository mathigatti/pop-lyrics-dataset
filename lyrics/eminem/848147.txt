Verse 1: 
In my mind i'ma fighter, my heart's a lighter, my soul is the fluid, my flow sparks at writer? 
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis, carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-idis 
Hard headed &amp; hot headed, bull headed &amp; pig headed, dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick 
quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics who wait for me to slip? with it, so quick 
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute, some lunatic lit it &amp; it's not Nelly 
do not tell me to stop yelling, when i stop selling i quit so, stop dwelling an i am not felling, 
you fuckers are not ready, cause i got jelly, like (Beyonce's) pot belly, this is destiny, yes money I'm of running 
so get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening 


Chorus: 
No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry, you can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me 
No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me, no remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me 
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all, 'till i get a call that god's coming 
No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny, i can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me, no apologies 

Verse 2: 
My head hit's the pillow, a weeping willow, i can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows 
But these chellows help just to keep me mellow, hand's on my head, touched knees to elbow 
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over, these cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me 
I keep saying it, i can't stress it enough, so keep playing it &amp; stand next to the subs 
I choke mic's like asphyxiation when I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin' 
Fuck yeah i'ma basket case &amp; i mastered this rap shit, 'till my ass gets wasted, 'till my assassination, 
'till I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation 
44 mags a fascination, a taste for disaster &amp; if that's the case then.. 

Chorus: 
No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry, you can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me 
No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me, no remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me 
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all, 'till i get a call that god's coming 
No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny, i can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me, no apologies 

Verse 3: 
This song isn't for you, it's for me, a true MC, it's what it do just to see if he still has it &amp; 
if his skills mastered, he's able to spill raps long after his killed, that's a real MC 
Got chu feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree, as long as there's still 
this hunger &amp; will in me, then expect a longer life expectancy 
I'd be a savage beast if i ain't have this outlet to salvage me inside, 
I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing an mourning, so I'm warning you, don't coax me 
it's silly, I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing, who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be, fooled 
The press blows up this whole thing, it's stupid, they don't know cause they don't see that I'm wounded 
all they did was ballooned it, i'm sick of talkin' 'bout these tattoos cartoon did, that's why i tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin' 
an they can suck my dick while I'm pukin', an you too, you can 

Chorus: 
Expect no sympathy from me, I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be, 
cold as a g, my heart's frozen it don't even beat, so expect no apologies 

Expect no sympathy from me, I'm an MC, this is how i'm supposed to be, 
cold as a g, my heart's frozen it don't even beat, so expect no apologies
