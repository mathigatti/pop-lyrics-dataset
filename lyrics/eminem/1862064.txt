You wanna start with the hook first?

Everybody get up, sit up Chris-stiffer
Been miserable without you Superman is a

Girl dont act like you never been kissed before
One, two, three, four, five, six thisa
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kissa
How did anybody ever find me I dissa
..Peared
I was hiding in Freeway's beard jussa
Hop, skip and a jump from my skin glision
Nails into my face that I been pushin'
Hellraiser
My face is my pin cushion
It's like when I'm on the mic
I can squisha, sucka like a vice grip
My pen putcha,
In the slaughter house cuz ya styles been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw
Take off like the blades on
My brain's on hyperdrive
Someone put the brakes on.

[Chorus]
Here's a smidgen, admitted
To get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it
Err ribbit, ribbit

My swag juice

My swag juice (x2)

Bee baby you can throw a frizbee in a blizzard
