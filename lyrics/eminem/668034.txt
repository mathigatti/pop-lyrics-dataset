Let's get down to business
I ain't got no time to mess around what is this?


New shit coming through; I ain't got no time to mess around
We coming

I got 50 Cent I got G-Uni we up in this bitch
With Obie Trice
So watch what you say 'fore you call our names you say one more thing
It won't be nice

Here we go i should've known 
That i would finally get pulled
Into some more shit sooner or later you little haters
Are too jealous of us to love us then Obie's coming
D12 is coming you're sick to your stomachs
50 percent of it's 50 Cent the other 50 percent of it's
Whose colour of skin it is
And before you even consider taking our label down 
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it I'm just trying
To give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cuz then it's gonna get to the point where it is gonna escalade
Into some other shit then I'ma flip 
Then I'ma get to stompin in my air force ones
You won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or one
It's gonna feel like so many feet kicking you 
You'll think Nike just made these in a cleat tennis shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be but
I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gon' put me in the position to pick at me
Y'all tickle me pink I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the dickety dock dickety
Mixed with a little bit of the jigga-j-jigga
With a small pinch of Biggie look at me I'm just the bomb

we the realest label 
dont try to act like you dont feel our label 
cuz we gon' fuck around and kill your label 
obie,D twizie,G unit,50, shady records 
we the label fo sho 

we the realest label 
dont try to act like you dont feel our label 
cuz we gon' fuck around and steal your paper 
obie,D twizie,G unit,50 we gon' kill yo fuckin label fo sho 
shady n the place to be c and it what it takes to rock the mic right 
still watch what you say to me punk cuz im off probation in less than six months
