Lord please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done


CHORUS
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Momma had a baby and its head popped off (head popped off 4x)
But momma don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off (gettin' dropped off 4x)
Ring ring ring, on the doorbell of the next door neighbors on their front porch
(their front porch 4x)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
(else's lawn 3x)
Til somebody finally took me in my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles (Edna and Charles 4x)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they'd gang up on me and sang this song
(sang this song 4x)
It went a little something like
"Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?"

CHORUS

Predominately, predominately, everything's always predominately
Predominately white, predominately black
Well what about me, where does that leave me
Well I guess that I'm between predominately both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding?
What do I look like some kind of idi...
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
And the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it... (shit)
If you only knew the half of it

CHORUS

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go
but life is like a merry go round
Here we go now, do-si-do, now curtains up, the show must go now
Ring-around-the-rosy, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me
This ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I can just turn off-and-on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
I said father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Oh!
Last one baby
Let's go
DETROIT!
