Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren oh oh
We don't want no problems
We don't like them, keep it moving
Here comes The weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh
Here comes The weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh


I just wanna play, big city, holiday
So get out of my way
If you know what's better for you
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight no oh oh

High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb
About to blow oh oh

Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren oh oh
We don't want no problems
We don't like them, keep it moving
Here comes The Weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh
Here comes The Weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh

Drink some pink champagne
I don't know you yet
But we'll forget so
F-ck what they say
Let the rum flow until it rains oh oh
I'm tearin up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight no oh oh

High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb
About to blow oh oh

Here comes,comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren eh oh eh oh
We don't look for trouble,just enough too,seeing double
Here comes The Weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh
Here comes The Weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh

Nothing high class in my glass
Only bottles of pop
My bottles are popped so when I pop up in the spot
Im probably not gonna be wanting to pop bubbly or Ciroc
I'm not Puffy but I'ma run this city tonight
When I hit it, I might act like a frickin' idiot
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight, big city lights
Little indignity, hot diggity
This Biggie is gettin' me hype
I don't get some liquor, I'll hurt you
I'll knock your d-ck in the dirt, bickerin' worse
Than that b-tch in that Snickers commercial
A mixture of Stiffler and Urkel
Hangin' from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this building
Cuz we're tearin' it down, security get out
The frickin' way, Jesus Christ the blaring is loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens going eeeeeh cause....

Here comes The Weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh
Here comes The Weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh

Oh oh

Here comes The weekend
Set off your sirens
Here comes The weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh
