They say everything is temporary
Who the hell are they anyways
I wanna know where does love go to die
Is it some sad empty castle in the sky


Did we just shoot too high, and spoil like wine
You walked by, and it's like our bodies never touch
No love you hold me close but I don't fell much
I cry maybe time isn't on our side
We have a thing but we lost it

One more go, I kinda thought if we took it slow
It might be easier for us, yeah for us to know
I know we never been quite here before
I wish I knew it when we lost it

You used to try to wake the beast in me
There's still a very sleepy part of me inside
I have been waiting to come alive
You stared into my eyes and turned to stone
And now I'm living all aone
In the four walls

There's a stranger, he's lying in my bed
Kinda blank like the thoughts living in my bed
This is the one that I felt that I knew so well
I think we had it but we lost it

I'm still the girl that you chased all around the world
I haven't changed, I've just replaced all the chains with pearls
I want the same thing we did back then
I know we had it but we lost it

Oh, the bone breaks it grows back stronger
The bone breaks it grows back stronger
The bone breaks it grows back stronger
The bone breaks

You walked by, and it's like our bodies never touch
No love you hold me close but I don't fell much
I cry maybe time isn't on our side
We have a thing but we lost it

Yeah
I wish I knew it when we lost it
