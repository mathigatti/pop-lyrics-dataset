How can I go on ? 
How can I go on this way... 


Where all the salt is taken from the sea 
I stand dethroned 
I'm naked and I bleed 
But when your finger points so savagely 
Is anybody there to believe in me ? 
To hear my plea and take care of me ? 

How can I go on 
From day to day 
Who can make me strong in every way 
Where can I be safe 
Where can I belong 
In this great big world of sadness 
How can I forget 
Those beautiful dreams that we shared 
They're lost and they're no where to be found 
How can I go on ? 

Sometimes I tremble in the dark 
I cannot see 
When people frighten me 
I try to hide myself so far from the crowd 
Is anybody there to comfort me 
Lord...take care of me 

How can I go on 
From day to day 
Who can make me strong in every way 
Where can I be safe 
Where can I belong 
In this great big world of sadness 
How can I forget 
Those beautiful dreams that we shared 
They're lost and they're no where to be found 

How can I go on ?
