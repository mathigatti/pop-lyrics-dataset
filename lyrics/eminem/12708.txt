When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older and I realized
She was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do
Or say to try to change her
Cuz that's just the way she was


They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They say I can't rap about coke no more
(Ahh!) Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
(Ahhh!) These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit cuz I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it
(Ahhh!) Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet, and put it through you
(Ahhh!) Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it slut, okay Ma?
Oh, now he's rapin' his own mother, abusing a whore
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You goddamn right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, vrinnn, vrinnn, vrinnn! (Chainsaw revs up)
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, You ain't nuttin but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothin' but a girl to me

I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (ah-haha)
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
Cuz Shady, will fuckin' kill you

Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up probe and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem on assault
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up in the 10th
(Ahhh!) Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In the tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothin' but a girl to me

I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (ah-haha)
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
Cuz Shady, will fuckin' kill you

Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These eighty G's a week to say the same things tweece!
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cuz their ratings stink?
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal, to the student body, and counselor
From in-school, to before school, to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play
I Got de machete from O.J.
I'm ready to makr everyone's throats ache!
You faggots keep eggin' me on
'Till I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Gimme your hands and feet!
I said shut up when I'm talkin to you!
You hear me? Answer me!

Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, You ain't nuttin but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothin' but a girl to me

I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (ah-haha)
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
Cuz Shady, will fuckin' kill you

Hahaha, I'm just playin' ladies
You know I love you
