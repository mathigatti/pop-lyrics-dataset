A lot of people ask me
Am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
I don't wanna die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
I can't change the way I am
But if I affended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck


I'm zonin' offa one joint
Stoppin' the limo
Hop in the window
Shoppin' the demo at gun point
A lyricist without a clue
What year is this?
Fuck a needle, heres a sword
Body pierce with this
Livin' them up
Never givin' a fuck
Gimme the keys I'm drunk
And I've never drivin' the truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open the scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Empty your four clips and bury your guns in the mud
I've calmed down now
I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months
With a buzz
My brain's gone
So worn my spirit is torn
The rest of my body is still being operated on
I'm duckin' the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've affended
Yeah fuck you too
To all the friends I use to have
I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done
Yo I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've affended
Ya fuck you too
Every time I reminist
Yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck
Ya'll can kiss my ass!

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
Cut you so fast
When your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle
And chain you at both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull
'Til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell sadam not to bother with making another bomb
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
I got your girl in my arm
And I'm armed with a fire arm
So big my entire arm's a giant fire bomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady  iron-on
And the pants that match
Here mama try 'em on
I get amastertive
With a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs
And a box full of laxitives
Proff of all school accidents
God help me
Before I commit some irresponsible acts again

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've affended
Yeah fuck you too
To all the friends I use to have
I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done
Yo I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've affended
Ya fuck you too
Every time I reminist
Yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck
Ya'll can kiss my ass!

I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
I spent a million a track
And went over my budget
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bug twitches
I'm withdrawling from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women
Fuck bitches
Gimme a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique
I'm a posse
Kamikaze
Strappin' the mother fuckin' bomb accross me
From the second I was born
My mama lost me
I'm a cross between manson-each ominozzi
I don't even know why the fuck I'm here in the first place.
The worst day on this earth was my first birthday.
Retarded?
What did that nurse say?
Brain damage?
Fuck, I was born during an earthquake

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've affended
Yeah fuck you too
To all the friends I use to have
I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done
Yo I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've affended
Ya fuck you too
Every time I reminist
Yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck
Ya'll can kiss my ass!
