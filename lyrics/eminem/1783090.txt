Yeah you got me
I'm up now, it's your loss
Suffered to you
History is like a point of no delay
Keeps repeating itself, what else can I say
You wondering why I act this way
Never should have gave you the time of day
I guess you know what time it is now ay


There must of been a gust of wind
Cause you change your mind everytime it blows
And you just changed it a motherf-ckin again
You just said you just wanted some dick 'fore I stuck it in
I wouldnt of been such a prick to you
F-ckin men you say you dont trust em
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushing
Some sh-t is goin down
You must've just not of been truthful from the start
See for me it'd be nothing to say you never had my heart
But I'd be lyin
F-ckin see why they call this bullsh-t a relationship
Ships sink
And you know its love as soon as you fall in it cause shit stinks
And it feels like everytime I f-ckin do I get jynxed
Cupid must've put a curse on me
6 Weeks have went buy and we only spoke twice
I'm sittin in your driveway callin' you from the car
Suffice I think its safe to say you're not at home
I'm callin your cell phone you answer
But I can tell though that your not alone
How was I to know it should of been time to go a long time ago
I kept holdin on
Its comical when I think back now
Why I couldnt get the hint
You feel the draft you were throwin I wasnt catchin' your drift
But theres a cold breeze blowin over me
I'm over you, success is the best revenge to pay you back
And that payment is overdo
I overcame odds to get even
The sober me is shittin on the unsober you
And I hope they play this in every club your go into
I'm hauntin' you bitch everywhere you turn I'm following you
Cause I loved you with every ounce of me
You know its true, its killin you now, yeah
I hope the hoe dies slow in you
Its cause of you now I dont 'em trust at all
F-ck a middle finger up
I'm gonna just keep grabbin my balls, cup em
I'll never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up em
So buttercup dont try to come back knockin on my door all dolled up

Cause I'm moving on, don't worry about me
Cause I'm gon be just fine without you, you'll see
There aint no-one on this earth right now I'd rmuch rather be
Cause God-dammit I'm glad that I'm me

I said if you could be where I'm at (bye bye)
You'd wanna be you too
(I'm living without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you'd be in as good a mood as I am
But you don't 'cause you just feel like you

I said if you could be where I'm at (bye bye)
You'd wanna be you too
(I'm living without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you'd be in as good a mood as I am
But you don't so you just feel like you

I've had it for the last time
You're actions got me hot as my last rhyme
You're options will either get put out greenwich or as fine
Fine just aint gon cut it
Drama is what you're in love with
You're one of them b-tches you run with
Lately I'm feeling smothered
You snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
Conceited with cover girl motives
I gotta rise above it
You think them models loving me
I'm thinking bout who doesn't
Doesn't really matter what you say
Sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon be splitting, you don't think I mean it
Meant it, everything I got, fuck you
Ain't no secret no apologies you keep it
Now that I'm doing my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy who needs it
Every rumour you hear you go believe it
Point out the times you've seen it
You stabbed me should linked it
Revenge is mine, I need it, need a way out
It's my f-cking life, let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought I'd break, aint that easy
Bet you thought I need you a million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you
Aint no freebies get your coat and go
The female pinnochio, money hungry, hopeless hoe
You f-cking with my focus so
Go back to that trunk that played the role before
Love is like a cancer when you don't let go (go)
I'mma blow fo 'sho
Unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I don't need you sinking us
I hope you float, lying through my teeth I hope you don't
(Drown, drown)
Now the sound of every dope
Bottles pop out while he smoke
Hit me pride that we broke
Let them girls crowding me go
If they got something to show
Let em show me how I love
I'm never lonely
Never even left a scar
You fell hard, I'm laughing
Ha ha ha ha ha
Tyre smoke fancy car
Nothing is what we are
No beginning no tomorrow
Cause I'm moving on, don't worry about me
Cause I'm gon be aight without you, you'll see
There aint no-one on this earth I'd much rather be cause God-dammit
I'm glad that I'm me

I said if you could be where I'm at (bye bye)
You'd wanna be you too
(I'm living without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you'd be in as good a mood as I am
But you don't so you just feel like you
