I wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound
I wanna push my face in and feel the swoon
I wanna dig inside, find a little bit of me
Cuz the line gets crossed when you don't come clean


My wormwood meets your pesticide
You'll never get out, coz you were never alive
I am infinite, I am the infant finite
Come a little closer and I'll show you why

(NO ONE IS - SAFE)
Noises, noises, people make noises
people make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to NOTHING

How does it feel to be locked inside another dream
That never had a chance of being realized?
What the fuck are you lookin' at?
I'll tell you what you're lookin' at
Everyone you ever fuckin' laughed at

Look in my eyes for the answers - typical
I can feel it underneath like a miracle
Everybody in the world needs more than
Lies and consequences to poser them
Once again, it's me and no one else
I can't remember if there was a someone else
It's not mine, it's not fair, it's outta my hands
And it's shaking - you'll never take me

(NO ONE IS - SAFE)
Noises, noises, people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to NOTHING

NOTHING!

(HATE) Hate ain't enough to describe me
(SCREAM) Somewhere between screaming and crying
I'm not supposed to behere
I'm not supposed to be

(WHY) When do I get to know why?
(BITTER) Bitter as the stink of when I try
I'm not supposed to be here
I'm not supposed to be

Pull your hands away
I'm gone - goodbye - it's so depressing
Withering away
Take a look - inside - my soul is missing
All I have is dead, so I'll take you with me
Feel like I'm erased - so kill me just in case

(COVET) Everything around me's mine
(STY) Can't see through the sties in my eyes
I'm not supposed to be here
I'm not supposed to be

(DOWN) Scratching and clawing all the way
(STAY) You won't let me fucking stay
I'm not supposed to be here
I'm not supposed to be

(LIVE) Is there another way to live?
(DIE) Cuz it's the only way to die
I'm not supposed to be here
I'm not supposed to be
