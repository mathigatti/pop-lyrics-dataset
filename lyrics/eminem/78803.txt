[Aye yo Paul, It's Em 
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing 
And I know that he's not 'thrilled' about the video 
What does he 'wanna be startin' somethin'?' 
Well I'll show him who's really 'bad' 
Paul, 'the way you make me feel' with these calls 
You should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror' 
And tell him to 'beat it' because I 'won't stop till I get enough' 
Do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'Billy Jean' video? 
Well he'll always be that Michael to me 
And it doesn't matter if he's 'black or white' 
Because I 'can't stop loving him' and I hate plastic surgeons 
And I hope they all fucking die! 
How do you like that? 
And I like him, I like him a lot 
I want to touch him but I can't 
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit 
Sorry 
Anyways, call me back 
I have this idea about how I want to end the show 
So, hit me when you get this message fucker 
Oh, and by the way 
No I don't have a new gun *click* (goddamn it)
