[Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me, people think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles
Even occasionally Doc Dre-zy will have to step in every once in awhile to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lota rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me if they heard some shit I lay to tape before they erase me. I may be a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me 20 times cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm going too fast cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
As long as when I'm pushin' up daisies and gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats when I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay Z. For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In that neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna' make or break me
Tryin' to strip me of my credibility and make me look fake G you're only gonna' be in for a rude awakening
Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna' face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me
You had all this time to think about it now don't pussy out and try to about face me
Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day that we finally meet in the same place to see...


[Chorus x2] [Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won,
No matter how many magazines on my nuts,
No matter how many mc's I eat up
Ooh ooh, it's never enough...

[50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
Uh oh it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk save it,
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you muthafuckas
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic its hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta' sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it, bag it or chop it
It'll get your high over and over but you gotta' cop it
When it's hot, it's hot you're hatin' son and now I'm gon' stop it...

[Chorus x2]
