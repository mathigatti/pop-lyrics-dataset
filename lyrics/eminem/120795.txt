Once you call my name out things will never be the same
They should have never let us get off foot in this game


Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missin' a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it
So they probably told you go with the flow just so that, I don't explode and
have another episode where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waitin' for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin' bananas
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it to fuckin' pole vault with
Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it
Anybody I throw flames at, gets a name it's a game
'Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin' to do with that
They all tryin' to get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin' jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin' lottery
And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
When we rhyme with each other
In time we discovered that we have more in common
then we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
'cause we started thinkin' God doesn't love us
Two odd motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up in ??? 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's gettin' dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and ah, operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin'
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't gotta agree all the time with me or see eye to eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is I could give a shit
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin' business as usual
Ego's aside, 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it wit' shoes you call Nike's
Earth links , how do you like these?
You gotta love them, look at the bottom of 'em they're like cleats
Stompin', I been rompin' since Tim Dogg was, hollerin' "Fuck Compton"
I was whilin', freestylin', back when, they was still makin', Maxell cassettes
It wasn't even raps Elvis yet
That tells us that, any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky-Ticky-Toc-Ticky-Ticky-Toc
Still with the Diggy-Diggy-Doc-Diggy-Diggy-Doc
And you don't stop
