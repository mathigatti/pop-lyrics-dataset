And the tears fall like rain 
Down my face again 
Oh the words you wouldn't say 
And the games you played 
With my unfoolish heart 
Oh I should have known this from the start 


Oh the winter and spring 
Going in hand in hand 
Just like my love and pain 
How the thought of you cuts deep within the vein 
Oh this brand new skin stretched across scared terrain 

I don't want to be let down 
I don't want to live my life again 
Don't want to be lead down the same old road 
So I don't want to be let down 
I don't want to live my lies again 
Don't want to be lead down the same old road 

All those years down the drain 
Love was not enough when you want everything 
What I gave to you and now the end must start 
Oh I should have listened to my heart 

'Cause I don't want to be let down 
I don't want to live my life again 
Don't want to be lead down the same old road 
So I don't want to be let down 
I don't want to live my lies again 
Don't want to be lead down the same old road 

Oh... 

I don't want to be let down 
I don't want to live my life again 
Don't want to be lead down the same old road 
So I don't want to be let down 
I don't want to live my lies again 
Don't want to be lead down the same old road
