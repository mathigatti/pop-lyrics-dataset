You are now listening to the sounds of...Shady and...Alchemist..Alchemist..Alchemist

Got an axe in the duffel bag, couple of fags
Stuffed in the backseat, muzzled n gagged
Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians ahh
Couple hustler mags, now grab the pez dispenser
Fill it up to the max, with muscle relaxers
The governor of Alaska, She lusts when I ask her
To shove my polaski sausage up in her ass huh
While we hover over Nebraska
Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture
In the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster
She's screaming "Grab my titties, Shady suck on those bastards"
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after
I'm a gigolo, But Ya'll look like the juggalo rapper
Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper


Shit, Back down
Man I'd rather lick on a scrotum
And eat the fucking octa Mom's pussy lips with some okra
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg scissors with Oprah
While Rosey pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa
Get a boner and play dick swords with the Jonas Brothers
Your mother fucking mothers are roamers, Like no other
I keep thinking of her smothered in soma's

Its chemical warfare, Drop bombs like sadam
I'm bringing the drama, Like Barrack Obama
Playing rock em' sock em' robots with the Octo Mama
I'm vato loco, homie I'll cock those llamas
For chemical warfare

[Develdiii]
