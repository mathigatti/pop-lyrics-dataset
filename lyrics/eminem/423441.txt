Everytime

It was 3 am when you woke me up
Then we jumped in the car
And drove as far as we could go
Just to get away
We talked about our lives
Until the sun came up
Now I'm thinking about
How I wish I could go back
Just for one more day
One more day with you
Everytime I see your face
Everytime you look my way
It's like it all falls into place
Everything feels right
Ever since you walked away
Left my life in disaray
All I want is one more day
All I need is one more day with you


When the car broke down
We just kept walking along
'Til we hit this town
There was nothing there at all
But that was all okay
We spent all our money on stupid things
But if I look back now
I'd probably give it all away
Just for one more day
One more day with you

Everytime I see your face
Everytime you look my way
It's like it all falls into place
Everything feels right
Ever since you walked away
Left my life in disaray All I want is one more day
All I need is one more day with you

Now I'm sitting here
Like we used to do
I think about my life
And how there's nothing I won't do
Just for one more day
One more day with you

Everytime I see your face
Everytime you look my way
It's like it all falls into place
Everything feels right

Everytime I hear your name
Everytime I feel the same
It's like it all falls into place
Everything feels right

You walked away
Just one more day
It's all I need
Just one more day with you
