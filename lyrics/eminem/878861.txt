[50 Cent:]
What y'all know about this fab shit, huh?
TE baby come on, uh-huh Trackmasters uh-huh


Look we can shop together mama, his and hers
Fifth Av. shit baby, Fendi furs
I ain't tight with the chips girl
I'm down to splurge
If it's ice you like I'll light up your life (Ooh)
VS2 Clarity alright
I play the block I ain't the type to punch your clock
I'm the type to put the metal to the floor in the drop
I live life in the fast lane
I make a grove of hash
Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass
It's like she loves me, she loves me not
Cause her friends pump her head hull of bullshit alot
I gave jewels I imported for her
Chanel bags I bought from boosters
To the hood I introduced her
She feisty every now and then she wanna fight me
People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon write me
The sick part is all that bullshit excites me

[chorus: Destiny's Child]
A thug's what I want
A thug's what I need
Even though my friends don't seem to see
That he lace me with money
He knows when I want it
And I'm never gonna leave my baby
My thugged out no good baby

[Eminem:]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr.
across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {Ow! Ow! Ow!}
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
as I fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}
and land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!

[chorus: Destiny's Child]
A thug's what I want
A thug's what I need
Even though my friends don't seem to see
That he lace me with money
He knows when I want it
And I'm never gonna leave my baby
My thugged out no good baby

[Erick Seamon:]
Uh, so mean, never seen the green, knahmean?
This jump off need two trampolines
Rock hard jeans sag low, new Timberlands
I works it like Missy and Timbaland
Cuban link chain hang E emblem
Chick 'round me multiplyin like Gremlins
Word to my momma, I bring drama
Like Osama, I'ma problem, period comma
I come through with the Bizkit, Limp'n
The Underground Kingz in the building, pimpin
Oh no, they must be feelin me
Pinch me now, this don't feel real to me
Oh yeah, it's my son's communion
Next month is my fan's reunion
Write this down in your pad
I'm thirty-("FOUR") and a half, and yeah I'm a Sagg'

[chorus: Destiny's Child]
A thug's what I want
A thug's what I need
Even though my friends don't seem to see
That he lace me with money
He knows when I want it
And I'm never gonna leave my baby
My thugged out no good baby

[Beyonce:]
A thug is what I want
And a thug is what I need
And my friends don't understand
How my baby laces me
A thug is what I want
And a thug is what I need
And my friends don't understand
And I think its jealousy
