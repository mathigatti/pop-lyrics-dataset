To the times we are good 
To the times we are bad 
We try to be somebody 
We cannot only stop. 


It never stops 
It never looks at 
If it never matters 

It does not stop 
It does not look at 
If it does not matter 

They try to make it the good 
Those that do not understand you 

They try to say any thing 
Those that knows the q you are passing 

It never stops 
It never looks at 
If it never matters 

It does not stop 
It does not look at 
If it does not matter. 

I thought about being been silent 
I thought about about not taking off satisfaction. 

Who league? 
I tried not to import itself, but nobody nor perceived that 
I did not import myself. 
It never stops 
It never looks at 
If it never matters 

It does not stop 
It does not look at 
If it does not matter
