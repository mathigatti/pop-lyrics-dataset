[Intro - News talk]

[Verse 1]

So this is it
this is what I wished for
just isn't how I invisioned it
fame to the point of imprisonment
I just though that shit'd be different
theres' something changed a minute
there I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it,
smell it,


started sniffin' it
and it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit!
I just wanted a little bit
then it turned me to a monster
I became a hippocrate,
concert after concert
I was raking in the dough,
rolling in green
had the game hemmed up like a sewing machine
but I was loosing my freedom,
there was nowhere for me
to not going and be seen
and just go and be me
and there was no inbetween
you either loved it or hate it,
every cd critics gave it the 3,
then 3 years later they go back and re-rate it
and called the slim shady LP the greatest,
the marshall mathers was a classic,
the eminem show was fantastic
but encore just didn't have the calibre to match it,
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
a couple of more years that shit'll be ILLMATIC
and 8 years later I'm still at it,
divorced,
re-married,
a felon,
a father,
sleeping pill addict.
And this is real talk,
I feel like the incredible hulk,
my back has been broke and I can still walk

[Chorus]

So be careful what you wish for,
cuz you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know
what to do with it cuz it might just come back on you tenfold

I said be careful what you wish for,
cuz you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know
what to do with it cuz it might just come back on you tenfold

[Verse 2]

I got a letter from a fan that said:
he's been praying for me,
everyday and for some reason it's been laying on my mind heavy,
cuz I dont read every,letter I get!
but something told me to go ahead and open it,
BUT,
why would someone pray for you when they dont know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local,
and as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
just to get to where I'm at,
I've already told you
at least
a thousand times in these rhymes,
I appreciate the prayer
but I've allready got,
god on my side
and it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it?
just watchin' it from an opposite stand-point
man, boys gotta look
nuts
and that's the only word I can think of right now,
won't know how to discribe the shit,
this is like a vibe you get
go ahead and bob to it,
just watch what you wish for
cuz I got this shit!

[Chorus]

So be careful what you wish for,
cuz you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know
what to do with it cuz it might just come back on you tenfold

I said be careful what you wish for,
cuz you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know
what to do with it cuz it might just come back on you tenfold
