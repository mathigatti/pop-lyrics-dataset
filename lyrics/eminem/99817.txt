[Eminem:]
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo turn the beat up a little bit.
Hey yo... this song is for anyone... fuck it.
Shut up and listen. 


(Hey yo...)
I sit back with this pack of zig zags, and this bag of this weed, 
It gives me the shit needed to be, the most meanest mc on this Earth.
And since birth I've been cursed, with this curse to just curse. 
[Marilyn Manson:] (Mother fuck!)
[Eminem:]
And just blurt this berserk, and bizarre shit that works.
And it sells, and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension, 
Dispensin' these sentences, gettin' this stress that's been eatin me recently;
Off of this chest, and I rest again peacefully. (Peacefully.)
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone, 
When you freaks see me out, in the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter;
To not come and speak to me. (Speak to me.)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a motherfucking thing!
I'm not Mister N*Sync, I'm not what your friends think.
I'm not Mister Friendly, I can be a prick.
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty. (Is on empty.)
No patience is in me, and if you offend me...
I'm liftin' you ten feet, (Liftin you' 10 feet.)... 
In the air, I don't care who was there, and who saw me destroy you.
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit.
I'll smile in the courtroom, and buy you a wardrobe.
I'm tired of arguin'. (Of arguin'.)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me.
And...

[Marilyn Manson:]
And I am... whatever you say I am.
If I wasn't... then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am.
Radio won't even play my jam.
'Cause I am... whatever you say I am.
If I wasn't... then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am.
I don't know, it's just the way I am.

[Eminem:]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered... 
With all of this nonsense it's constant;
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content, 
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
And all of this controversy circles me, 
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me. (Finger at me.)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky.
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up,
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up...
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too.
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school,
And they blame it on Marilyn. (On Marilyn.). 
[Marilyn Manson:] (Uhahhhhhhhhhh.)
[Eminem:]
And the heroin, where were the parents at?! (Parents at!)
And look where it's at, middle-America, 
Now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see...
An upper class city, havin' this happenin. (This happenin.).
Then attack Eminem, 'cause I rap this way. (Rap this way.).
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel, that I need for the fire;
To burn, and it's burnin', and I have returned!
And...

[Marilyn Manson:]
And I am... whatever you say I am.
If I wasn't... then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am.
Radio won't even play my jam.
'Cause I am... whatever you say I am.
If I wasn't... then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am.
I don't know, it's just the way I am.

[Eminem:]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired,
That I wish that I would just die, or get fired.
And dropped from my label, and stop with the fables.
I'm not gonna be able, to top on "My Name Is." (My name is...)
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation,
To cop me rotation at rock 'n roll stations.
And I just do not got the patience... (Got the patience.)
To deal with these cocky caucasians;
Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black, 
'Cause I talk with an accent, and grab on my balls. 
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions. (Fuckin' questions.)
What school did I go to? What hood I grew up in...
The why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how;
'Till I'm grabbin my hair, and I'm tearin it out!
'Cause they drivin' me crazy! (Drivin' me crazy!) 
[Marilyn Manson:] (Errrrrahhhhh!!!)
[Eminem:]
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin';
I stand and I sit... and I'm thankful for every fan that I get.
But I can't take a shit, in the bathroom, 
Without someone standin' by it.
No I won't sign your autograph,
You can call me an asshole... 
I'm glad...

[Marilyn Manson:]
And I am... whatever you say I am.
If I wasn't... then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am.
Radio won't even play my jam!
'Cause I am... whatever you say I am.
If I wasn't... then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news everyday I am.
I don't know, it's just the way I am.
(Way I am... way I am... way I am...)

[Marilyn Manson:] Hey! Hey! Hey!
[Eminem:] I don't know, it's just the way I am.
[Marilyn Manson:] Hey! Hey! Hey!
[Eminem:] Radio won't even play my jam.
[Marilyn Manson:] Uhahhhhhhhhhh.

[Eminem:] 'Cause I am... whatever you say I am.
[Marilyn Manson:] Hey! Hey! Hey!
[Eminem:] 'Cause I am... whatever you say I am.
[Marilyn Manson:] Hey! Hey! Hey!
[Eminem:] 'Cause I am... whatever you say I am.
[Marilyn Manson:] Hey! Hey! Hey!
[Eminem:] Radio won't even play my jam.
[Marilyn Manson:] Uhahhhhhhhhhh.
[Eminem:] 'Cause I am... whatever you say I am.
[Marilyn Manson:] Hey! Hey! Hey!
