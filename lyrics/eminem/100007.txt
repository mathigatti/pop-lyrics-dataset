Yeah..50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo 
G-UNIT! 


[Lloyd Banks] 
This rap shit plays a major part of my life 
So if you jeapordize it I got the right 
To send a mothafucka at you tonight 
G-Unit! And I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin' 
Swimmin' in barrels of money 
Ma could walk around wit' a head up and challenge you dummy 
It's funny, niggas rather see you sufferin' and hungry 
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money 
Take your hats off, you know you ain't that tough 
I'm callin' your bets off as soon as you act up 
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball 
Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (Lloyd Banks!) 
By the way, this feels like I'm dreamin' 
Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen 
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon 
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em 
Get my nut while I'm breathin' 
'Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin' 
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'? 
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position 
Death wish for no religion whether Catholic or Christian 
Listen, I went through my ambition in and out the kitchen 
With probable cause, it's probably sendin' out to prison 
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours 
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards 

[Tony Yayo] 
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me ('Cause what?) 
'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto 
Niggas hate when you do good 
But when you broke, your friends and your enemies 
They love you, they love you 
"Cheche, get the llello" 
Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail 
"Cheche, get the llello" 
Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!) 
You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie 
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country 
Wallstreet niggas, they cop me on the low 
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow 
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane 
I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble 
I'll make your money double 
Cook me in baking soda 
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover 
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator 
Feed your family, turn your man into a hater 
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox 
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks 
If you cop three and a half you hustlin' backwards 
Cop a hundred grams, you movin' forwards 
You tryin' to move more birds 
...In PA all day, on the corner of Third 

[50 Cent] 
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what?) 
'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto 
Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you 
The shells hit you, you screamin' 
Think I'm playin'? I mean it 
Man, I done bought all these pistols 
Lets get it poppin' 
Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin' (C'mon) 
Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide 
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin' 
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants 
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned 
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons 
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish 
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like "50 nice chain" 
Malasio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game 
Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET 
Nigga you see me! 
I wonder if you mad, 'cause I'm doin' good 
or 'cause niggas feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood 
And it hurts 'cause you love 'em and they don't love you back 
'cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat 
You pussy 

Yeah, explain it to niggas in your hood nigga 
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga 
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga 
Niggas know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga 
Read the "Daily News" nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga 
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit 
Pussy, lets get it poppin' 

G-G-Unit, G-G-Unit, G-G-G-Unit, G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit, G-Unit!
