You can't let nobody stand in your way
You've just got to get back up yeahh, you've just gotta get back up ohoo
And take down everything that you cannot change now
You've just got to get back up yeahh, you've just gotta get back up ohoo


[T. I.]
Hey what it is world? Yeah it's me again
Back before you, at your mercy, on bended knee again
No runnin from the truth, as much as we pretend
That it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends (I'm sorry)
For lettin you down, I won't take you down this road again (uh-uh)
Most of you now sayin "Whatever, here we go again"
Blogs, radio and television all goin in
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment (I gotta say)
I gotta say you f***n haters is hilarious (ha ha)
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou?
Point your finger now with me looking down (down)
Same clown that was Twitpicing at my wedding
On the same Twitter page disrespecting, wait a second
Never mind my imperfections, this a fact, remember that
No mistake's too great to recover and bounce back

You can't let nobody stand in your way
You've just got to get back up yeahh, you've just gotta get back up ohoo
And take down everything that you cannot change now
You've just got to get back up yeahh, you've just gotta get back up ohoo

[Eminem]
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same s***t but don't say s***t
You Liberace's, Versace's and you Nazis
Watch me 'cause you thinkin' you got me in this hot seat
You m*********s wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed as you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise 'em 'cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' 'em go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to and it's called
This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do s***t

[Chorus]
You can't let nobody stand in your way
You've just got to get back up yeahh, you've just gotta get back up ohoo
And take down everything that you cannot change now
You've just got to get back up yeahh, you've just gotta get back up ohoo

[Lupe Fiasco]
Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not a holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become an actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash them down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away
