One, two, three, for, five, six, seven, eight…
What's the matter? After eight, there's a nine, remember?
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid…
Are you really sooooooooooo 
Stupid stupid stupid stupid…


This is my song, my song, he's mine…
Better a silly girl with a flower,
Then a silly boy with a horse and a stick
Come one, yeaaaaaah…
Its called a lance, hellohow???

I'm a painter of red bolletjes!!
Don't you understand, 
They're not Yellow, not green, not black…
What? I lik coffee, I like tea, I like the boys…
But the boys don't like me!!!

You didn't expect this did yooooooooeeeeeee…
Love ya, Love ya, I say that I love ya!!
Silly silly silly boy…
