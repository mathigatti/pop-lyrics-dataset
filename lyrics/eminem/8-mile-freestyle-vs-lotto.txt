Fucking with Lotto dawg you gotta be kiddin.
That makes me believe you really don't have a interest in livin.
You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say?

That's why I didn't wanna be the one you commit suicide to.
Fuck Lotto ... call me your leader.
I feel bad I gotta murder that dude from leave it to beaver.
I used to like that show now you got me in fight back mode.
But oh well if you gotta go ... then you gotta go.

Is that a tank top or a new bra?
Look Snoop Dogg has got a fucking boob job!
Didn't you listen to the last round meathead?
Pay attention your saying the same shit that he said.
Matter a fact dawg, here's a pencil.
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful
and don't come back until somethin dope hits you.
Fuck it, you could take the mic home with you.
Lookin like a cyclone hit you.
Tanktops screamin "Lotto I don't fit you!"
You see how far them white jokes get you,
boys like "hows Vanilla Ice gonna diss you?"
My motto fuck Lotto.
I'll get them digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow.
