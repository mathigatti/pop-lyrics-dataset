I'm gonna go where the sun's in the sky
And I'm gonna go where the moon is high
And I'm gonna go where the rivers run free
I'm gonna go where I can be me


I'm gonna go where the grass is green (I'm gonna go where grass is green)
And I'm gonna go where the water's clean (I'm gonna go where water's clean)
And I'm gonna go where the sky is clear (I'm gonna go where sky is clear)
I'm gonna go away from here

I'm gonna think about better things
Think about better things

I'm gonna build a fire by the sea (I'm gonna build a fire by the sea)
And I'm gonna be alone with me (I'm gonna be alone with me)
I'm gonna feel the wind on my face (I'm gonna feel the wind on my face)
And I'm gonna go away from this place

Make me a potion to drink I won't make it too sweet
I've got to think about bitter things - think about better things
Time don't care too much about the pace
Just falls on the world stays on your face
Better things, well think about better things

I'm gonna go where the sun's in the sky
I'm gonna go where the moon is high
And I'm gonna go where the rivers run free (I'm gonna go where rivers run free)
I'm gonna go where I can be me
