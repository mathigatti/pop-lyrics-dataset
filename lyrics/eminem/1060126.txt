[Eminem]What up D!
[50 cent] Yeah Man!
[Eminem] Lets Get it!



Shit on the mic and doodle my doo doo 
You do not have a fighting chance to move you are covered in my poo poo 
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid 
Dou dou dou dou dou dou ga ga ga goobers are glued to you 
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do do you? 
So just sit back and watch somethin you just gon have it watch 
So you just made me sneeze I'm allergic to beats like these 
Excuse my allergies are actin up thanks a lot Scott 
You're probably wonderin why there's thunder and everyone 
Is runnin and duckin up under everything up on the block 
Cause busa bus and flipmode just tiptoed into the club 
Then with shady quietly try not to start a riot with Doc 
But since we already started we might as well have a party 
So gather out everybody come on lets get our drink on 
And you aint got to do nothin special for this occasion 
Just reach in your closet, throw somethin on and get to the club

[50 cent] 

Every single time you put my shit in the cd playa and 
Turn up the volume you bang your head with courtesy of knock I 
Continue to crumblin niggas and tumblin niggas 
You struggle while I humble a nigga wit the glock 
Than I watch you while I keep a fumblin while I got you 
Ta tremblin for one of my niggas bust your head wit a rock 
Before I start to do another thing that'll make you crown me 
the king wit such a butterswing nigga follow the flock 
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds the summer bling 
while im climbin and from a glimpse tell you bitch to get off my yot
