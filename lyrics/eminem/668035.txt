Aight listen …. Sometimes you've got to turn the beat up cuz its sick
Listen … fuck it , just let me spit….
Yow……
Here goes ….


Sometimes I feel like hurting the people who hurted me 
Or even murder them, see 
am a renegade ,revenge is what I need
am not the type who smokes weed to impress
I would smoke it cuz am depressed
But I don't need drugs to make new friends
Like all the rest of you fagots think
Sometimes am starting to scrabble shit
But just can't finish it of
And when it looks ready am trying to spit it
But keep forgetting the words

Sometimes we've got to see the difference between 
Real life and music and what's on our mind
Sometimes we've got to leave the misery behind
And read between the lines 
Sometimes we even got to drive trough red lights
And kill mic's we might wanna answer some questions right

Sometimes when am alone am starting to think
Why do I even exist I've got nothing to bring
And in class am the weakest link and then am starting to sing 
But I want ya'll people to realize and starting to  see 
that somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
sometimes when am alone I feel like quitting this life
but then I realize that it aint right
some shit reminds me of the dad I never had
why do I keep running from what I needed so bad
Sometimes I think life's a game
And everybody's a player who got
Something to bring or something to say
We got prayers, cops, waitresses even snobs
Who stink in there jobs but still get paid a lot
Sometimes life's fucked up….

Sometimes we've got to see the difference between 
Real life and music and what's on our mind
Sometimes we've got to leave the misery behind
And read between the lines 
Sometimes we even got to drive trough red lights
And kill mic's we might wanna answer some questions right
