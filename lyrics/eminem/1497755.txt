[Dr. West:] Morning, Marshall.
[Eminem:] Morning, doc.
[Dr. West:] So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?
[Eminem:] Anxious.
[Dr. West:] Anxiety?
[Eminem:] Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous.
[Dr. West:] Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?
[Eminem:] Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back


[Dr. West:] Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't.
[Eminem:] Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?
[Dr. West:] Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, we know you're a busy person.
[Eminem:] But I thought variety was the most important thing?
[Dr. West:] So what else are you thinking?
[Eminem:] Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them.
[Dr. West:] Steps?
[Eminem:] Yeah, steps.
[Dr. West:] There's a lot of them, aren't there?
[Eminem:] Well, twelve.
[Dr. West:] Christ, I don't even know them all.
[Eminem:] Really?
[Dr. West:] Anything else?
[Eminem:] Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, what do I do if I find myself in a situation where maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?
[Dr. West:] Take a drink.
[Eminem:] What?
[Dr. West:] Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off.
[Eminem:] Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to.
[Dr. West:] What, you mean these? *shakes pills*
[Eminem:] Man, what the fuck!?
[Dr. West:] Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall?... Marshall!?
[Eminem:] No, no, no, no, NO!
