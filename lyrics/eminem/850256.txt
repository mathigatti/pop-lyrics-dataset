[Eminem] Shadyyyyy, we're back

[Eminem]
Nothin' can stop and nothin' can change it
You better just make new living arrangements
If you think you're the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown out the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is, I'm best at this, and I'm best at that
but I don't hear my name, no ???? bought up in rap
And I don't usually trip but the day I get caught up in that
but when they say one of the best, no way I thought it was that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie, or maybe
they'll name me, somewhere down at the bottom right after AZ
or say he ripped that Biggie verse or that Jay-Z
Yo, his verses were crazy, on that Renegade beat
but I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And I all I hear is Pac tunes come on the rad-i-o
and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well may be
the same reason they don't say me
when they speak on hip hop pledges which has amazed me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
and make it big-big-big-big-b-baby


[Obie Trice]
So maybe the 80's made me crazy
I been tryin' to get my weight up since the A Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paid the ways
So lately mind state's gets better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin'
the eight fee at 18, 8 years later
His voice in Beijing, no choice I chase cream
So...

[Eminem] Shadyyyyy, we're back

[Stat Quo]
(Stat Quo, yeah!)
This is what I eat, sleep, breath and feed my kids
whatever I feel my family needs
I treat the mic like the block
fought with my rocks
and squeeze critics who expect me to under achieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
I rollin' back my sleeves
Show other breed my brand wrapped to his knees
And tell him suck my dick, take a bow and leave
with a sack full of amar cheese, I found it hard to believe
Who the bullet perceive to be G's
and claim there runnin' shit, nigga I run me
An as a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
that same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood asking, where I be
dawg I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it, drink my pee
Record songs for the Detox LP
feet don't fail heat, niggas got me bent like cranberry and bellvee
I'ma die wealthy, boss of the game
what the fuck they goin' tell me
A-Town's own tre, Aftermath Shady

[Eminem] Shadyyyyy, we're back

[Bobby Creekwater]
Y'all market y'all own block, they see me ???? that
rap game's an old flame my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth I got the right knit
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a cold June, no 'bout
y'all niggas won't be satisfied till I show ????
Go out on the limb with Em 'cause I'm with him
Put a barrel to they apparel to you and some of them
Stand a chance at the dance without a bowtie
Shady Records re-introduced you niggas to multi, so hot
All the light that they have given me
and the haters like a chauffer, because it's have driven me
to a view with a vendetta, I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about you, nigga I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season
so I'm just breezin' through the track, nigga

[Eminem] Shadyyyyy (Ca$his!)

[Ca$his]
I can prove I'm here to somethin' you never do
from hand to hand coke sales for my revenue
I ain't been to a bucks an why I ain't snuck a weapon through
there's no background reveals a 1-8-7-2
till the block I'm the truth, to the cops I'm the proof
And if a nigga's still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics to the booth
In the Shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me an you
I already done an lived the street life, niggas run away from it
You follow my life, in the Midwest blunted
Pitchfork's held high, four fifth by the stomach
You find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the bulidin', shootin' at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'ma walkin' obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'm see
I'll have you braked in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight, from MS-13
with SK's, AR's an many bought teens
I'm Ca$his, the last of the real
We're strapped on Prozac B's and E pills, it's the rap
Got the block on tip, 2 ???? of crack
I'm in the lifetime contract, Shady's back, nigga

[Eminem]
(Shadyyyyy, we're back)
Ha, I told you we was back {*laughs*}
