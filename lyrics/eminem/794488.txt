There's a dog loose in the wood. 
Dogfish Rising. 
It's good for gnawing. 
Right wing Interlude. 
In the 1990's ? 
Thats got a nice groove to it there. 
I saw a human hand. 
Windmills like two. 
Something in my left. 
Screaming to fullfill. 
Postniff scruchies? 
Dogfish Rising.. 
Burn em' for thier nipples. 
another rubber Rolex. 
So skinny I knows. 
Rookie, Lurks. 
Battery powered power tool. 
God spoke to me. 
Dogfish rising. 
Blistering cabbage. 
That dogfish is dead. 
We need this band. 
Crusty fuzzy nuts-bye.
