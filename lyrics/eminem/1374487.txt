One little, two little, three little indians! 
("check this out") 
One little, two little, three little indians! 
("ahh yeah!") 


[Jam Master Jay] 
Httin hard, now check the hard hit 
("Jam Master.. Jay") about to flip 
Slide for a minute but I won't slip son 
God had my back since ("day.. one") 
Back to the track in fact the track's fat 
Peace to my brothers and my sisters in black 
Disrespect and don't know how to act 
You better come correct or I'ma have to bust your hat 
One little, two little indians and me 
Jam Master Jay and Run-D.M.C. 
We been down since (UHH) eighty-("three") 
And ninety-three ain't nuttin but another year to me 
Cause I flip the scripts, grab hips, give tips 
and bust lips, ?? goes the whole length 
So get it, get with it, that did it 
And if you is a critic get the didick, cause it's 

One little, two little, three little indians! 
Word up.. 
One little, two little, three little indians! 
(uh-huh, uh-huh) 
One little, two little, three little indians! 
("check this out") 
One little, two little, three little indians! 
("ahh yeah!") 

[D.M.C.] 
I write rhymes I got rhythm I continue to flow 
Recitin lines full of wisdom make decisions with Joe 
Tonight I'm gettin busy won't you give me my dough 
Night time strictly busy for the kids at the show 
That's my hobby kemosabe I be tearin up streets 
and the posse gots to have me in the Cherokee Jeeps 
I'm attackin like Apache boy don't have a cow 
Just give me matches for the flames because it's time to pow-wow 
All the suckers run for cover all the others discover 
One two little three little indian brothers! 

One little, two little, three little indians! 
("check this out") 
One little, two little, three little indians! 
("one, one, one, huh-hah!") 

Here we go (7X) 

[Run] 
Begin it, bust it 
DJ, Run and, D.M.C.'n 
JM, J'n how ya livin in ninety-three 
cause we be three little indians, sleepin in a teepee an' 
keepin up a funky fat philosophy cause we be 
re-arrangin, changin, isn't it, different 
Told ya bout retirement, definitely infinite 
flavor, gave up, +Hype+ to Public Enemy 
I like the mic I rock upon the pad and pen a friend to me 
Hit ya with the truth I get to hit ya with the booth 
cause your troops deserve a king, proverb, hmmm! 
Listen, listen to the beat inside your soul 
Knowledge, wisdom is more precious, than gold 
The indians, comin, DJ, Run and 
claimin back the land that the man, stole from him 
It's bout, that time, for mine, come ?? and 
Jay Joe and King who are we? Little indians 

One little, two little, three little indians! 
("check this out") 
One little, two little, three little indians! 
("one, one, one, huh-hah!") 

One little, two little, three little indians! 
("check this out") 
One little, two little, three little indians! 
("ahh yeah!") 

"aight, auhh, check this out.."
