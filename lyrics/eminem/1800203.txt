Oh

[Chorus]
Got to have it
Yeah I made it
I'm addicted
Yeah I'm fading (fading)


[Eminem: Verse 1]
This is a beat with no words at first, it's a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it's brain strength training
Starts off something like Shady's an insane maniac
Yeah Slim Shady thats a zany name ain't it
Now all you needs an image to go with the name, baby
Wife beaters and white t-shirts
Hanes mainly, its a long shot but is it possible
Theres a lane maybe
If not, he's gonna have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it
He can see his name up in lights
Women screaming his fucking name feinting
Shady did it, he sold out the whole stadium
Joe Smo made it, he took his plain Jane Lady
And his baby Hailey out the trailer
But he ain't trailing anymore he's ahead of the race
While maintaining his innocence
Little does he know his train is derailing
And he's about to be raped by this game anally, now

What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little hit?
For the C.O.C.A.I.N.E
'Cause once you get in you won't wanna leave

Got to have it
Yeah I made it
I'm addicted
Yeah I'm fading (fading)
Oh
'Cause once you get in you won't wanna leave

[Eminem - Verse 2]
You're operating on all cylinders
Syllables spit like dillingers
Spilling your guts
People are feeling your mic skills
But these haters are ice grillin' ya
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya
But you can't decipher why for the life of ya
It wasn't like this when you were cyphering
Argue with your ife again
She found vicodin in your pants last night again
Your disputes public
Nothing is private anymore
When your best friends say bye bye to him
What kind of apple you take a bite of Slim
(But this is what you wanted Marshall ain't it)
Fuck no, the way that it turned out
Was nothing like the picture that I painted in my head
Sometimes a dream I make is more fun than to actually make it
The game stripped me naked
It robbed me of ever having another real relationship
With another girl, this World is a fucking trip
As I slip in another world
Proceed, take another hit
Sniff til I fucking hurl
Tell 'em all to fucking sit and spin til they fucking twirl
Middle finger up again
Relapsing back in this game, oh well, fuck it then

[Chorus]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little hit?
For the C.O.C.A.I.N.E
'Cause once you get in you won't wanna leave

Got to have it
Yeah I made it
I'm addicted
Yeah I'm fading (fading)
Oh
'Cause once you get in you won't wanna leave

[Jazmine Sullivan: Hook]
Start off right
Just to see your name in lights
Just so you can live the life
You take a bite
And lose your sight
They call this (Fame)

You think you good (ha ha)
Just cause you got out the hood
Concerned only with getting dough,
No longer poor but lost your soul They call this.. (Fame)

I hear it callin'
My name is callin'
Why you strugglin'
When you could be ballin'
My head is sayin' yeah
But my feet is stallin'
So many walk in
But any fallin'
But I got to have it
Like Eve and the apple
She had to grab it
I got to take it
I got to make it
That's the plan
And I can't forsake it

[Chorus]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little hit?
For the C.O.C.A.I.N.E
'Cause once you get in you won't wanna leave

Got to have it
Yeah I made it
I'm addicted
Yeah I'm fading (fading)
Oh
'Cause once you get in you won't wanna leave
