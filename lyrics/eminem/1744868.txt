You ready to do this
Ok
Hahaha
Come on
Let's go
This is an invasion
The Evil Genius, Green Lantern
Mike Shinoda
Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to a Fort Minor event
The countdown has begun
The Rising Tied is almost here
But for now..
C'mon Mike


Let's get it going for the everyman, anybody
You gotta be ready
It's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologise or even think of saying sorry
This is the way we rock st..

Let's get it going for the everyman, anybody
You gotta be ready
It's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologise or even think of saying sorry
This is the way we rock steady over everybody

You probably shocked
Probably ready to stop this already
You probably can't hang with the weight we attack it so steady
We let it rock the road
Bang the bend
Shake the chevy
Tiil everybody feels it in their chest
Stay with it

This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees
so Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)

Wait a second
You know the program
This is not slow jam
This is not a love song
Unless you love tearing shit down
Take a look around, you're not running this
You're bluffing, you're nothing
We'll hit you like a ton of bricks
Pitch it together with pressure you could never stand
The softest leather just a featherweight we'll never man
We're not your competitors setting you it straight
You'll never compete
Forget it, it's already too late
Go!

This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees
so Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)

If I don't see I'ma make you see this
If you don't know I'ma make you believe it.
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)

Ssh
Gimme a second, I'm collecting my thoughts and setting plots
Alright ya'll ready or not
I've listened and watched and waited for an opening spot
And now that i got it nobody can pay me to stop
I'm sick of that same thing I've been forced to hear
Over and over again
Let me make this clear
If anybody pretends that we're nothing to fear
I solemnly swear it's over
You can tell 'em we're here

This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees
so Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)

If I don't see I'ma make you see this
If you don't know I'ma make you believe it.
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)
Get up (Get up)

Everybody owes, everybody pays because
