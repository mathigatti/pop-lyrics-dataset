Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab Sticky right quick
Hey yo Stick, Stick
[Sticky]
Yo Slim Shady
Yo I just had like a nightmah..
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dreah.. 
Well it wasn't a good.. (What was it?)
Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (What?)
Yo, yo I dreamed I was white! (Ohhh)

What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white?
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white,

Verse One: Sticky Fingaz
Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as Eminem's?
Blond hair, blue eyes 
The whole shibang
I know one thing
Police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me 
(Can I get your autograph?)
Yellow cabs in the cities that stop for me
I wouldn't need caladeral to buy property
If I was white
Wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (Maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob
And automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white
I wouldn't thought O.J. was innocent (He did it)

If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (Yo think about that)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (for a
minute)
What if he was white?
What if he was (What if he was white?)
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white,
white? (What if 
he was white?)

What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if you were white? (what if he was white?)
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white,(STICKyyyy what if you were
white?) white, 
white,
white, white, white?

Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz
If I was white 
It would be a different world for me
If I was white (ummmmmmmm?)
What shade would I be?
Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, prepi or high class?
YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILERPARK AND BE WHITE TRASH!
In any case that be L-Slim right? (Yep)
But there's a good and bad out of being white
You can't say the N word without starting a fight 
(What's UP MY BROTHER?)
True dance it'll be, I had two left feet
Even if I was white
Plaque still have a ghetto shit(How you doing?)
Is it a minfo
Or do I really have a little dick (Nah, it's true!)
If I was white 
I would probably listen to hardcore rock
and covered my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh)

If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (What if he was white?)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white

he was white?)
What if he was white?
What if he was white? 
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was
white(ummmmmmmm?)
What if he was white? (What if you were white?)
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white,
white? (What if 
he was white?)

Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz
Yo,yo,yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I watched Tennis and golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings
Man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
In it probably wouldn't never even been an Onyx shit
I be serice sippin vadka and tonixs
Smokin on them all on a marboral
instead of a nueport
I live in Long Island 
Instead of New York
If I was white
I probably couldn't dunk 
Cuz everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope!)
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the trees spots
Cuz all the niggas trend think I was a cop

If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? 
What - If - He - Was - White?(Yo you can't say that)
What if he was white
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white,

What if you were white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
