Well Jimmy Moved in with his mother
'Cos he aint got no place to go
And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag thats full of clothes
'Coz you live at home in a trailer
What the hell you gonna do?
'coz i live at home in a trailer
Mum I'm cummin home to you


Well my name is Jimmy 
His names Greg Bewel
Me him and you all went to the same school,
This aint cool
I'm in a rage 
He's tapping my mum we almost the same age
On the microphone i drop bombs 
Look at this car thanx alot mum
Here happy birthday rabbit
Heres a brand new car you can have it
A nine-teen twenty-eight Delta
This shit wont even get me 2 tha shelter! 
And i cant even stand for motel coz 
Im back in the 810 now

'Coz i live at home in a trailer mum im cumming home to you!
