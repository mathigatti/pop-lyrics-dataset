Don't stop
don't stop


[Royce Da 5' 9"]
Yeah, Bad and Evil is (BACK)
we bout to get into a tail of gunner that details the dungeon
this is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
oh once again where I fail from blundering
Shady lifted his wing than I fell from under it
now I'm freefallin'
my career is gone and the weed callin'
regardless of who's fault I was b-ballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Marshall double backed and got me from on top of the Hearse
I'm alive n-gga, Justin T ain't got nothing on me
cause I done cried Mary J Blige rivers
I realised that God's with us as soon as I decided to put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges
the writings on the wall since n-ggas seen me at the baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z
suddenly everybody calls
"like I'm just checking on you dog"
while I throw up this message on the star

[Chorus]
when them bottles stop poppin'
and them dollars start stopping
do what you did to get it and dont stop (dont stop)
I made a promise to my momma
I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters dont stop (dont stop)

I'm living proof n-gga
its pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
its the Worldwide American way
I'm living proof n-gga

[Eminem]
Your body language is sayin' your confidence is gone
well pick ya ass up lil homie, come on
you just gone sit there and take it or make em suck it
tell em where to shove it straight up (?)
f-ck it,
the last time the light kicked me in the ass
I pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass
man what a catastrophy it'd be for me to be a bitch ass p-ssy
and not open a can of whoop ass
did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day I say I aint poop
shit, the day that I dont straight shoot
I'll drop out of my anti-women hate group
say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back and put it on straight loop
you haters look like you ate a grape fruit
you see me climbing back on that wagon
got my swagga back I was dragging, hop back on it
grab the reigns on that bastard and came back on em
without remorse man
man of course I'm a one trick pony
cause I'll be screaming on these horns till I'm hoarse!

[Chorus]
when them bottles stop poppin'
and them dollars start stopping
do what you did to get it and dont stop (dont stop)
I made a promise to my momma
I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters dont stop (dont stop)

I'm living proof n-gga
its pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
its the Worldwide American way
I'm living proof n-gga

Nah I aint fading yet
I'd rather stay and rap
I mighta made a deck
I find excitement in wondering what I'ma write next
so I dont stay in debt
me broke
you might aswell cut the embryo out my momma and play catch with the baby
with AK's with baby bayonet's
I'ma get rich or I'mma die trying
thats why its either kill or be killed
so call me suicide homocide Ryan

[Eminem]
Theres a bomb inside my head
I'ma live wire, I am on the edge
teetering on it like I tore the iron mike
get on a nut like a tyre iron
I have no desire stopping so why would I drop and roll
thats how much Im flying higher(?)
rappers are fun and I'm the time cause I'm just flying by
