In your garden
I try to fall asleepSister Mary
Walking on the wall
Sister Mary
Heading for a fall
Sister Mary
Waiting for a call
Sister Mary
Pride before a fallSo many moments
All I really neede was the one
So many moments
I have been mistreated
Playings done
Pretty soon I'm gonna run
Sister Mary
Walking on the grass
Sister Mary
Breathing on the glass
Sister Mary
Looking at the past
Sister Mary
You've got peace at last
So many moments
All I really neede was the one
So many moments
I have been mistreated
Playings done
Pretty soon I'm gonna runTake it or leave it
'cause I don't care
you better believe it
I'm down there
Take it or leave it
I'm down there
Take it or leave it
'cause I don't care
I come out of the blue
Bringing dark days for youIn your garden
I try to stay awake
