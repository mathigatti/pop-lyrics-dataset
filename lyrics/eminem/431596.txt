welcome to this institution
one way to resolution
I'm put on this medication, rolls down my throat
cause I cant ever sleep at night the same
this medication it controls, enjoys most every day
well! and! and! cause I cant sleep into the night but
cause I close my eyes, I see land


what did I say?
what could I say to put her to sleep?
and fall awake and die
and I'm never going` to bed

back to this day, back into this day
back to another level hotter than hell
said we ain't savages, until we do it again
back to `another level hotter than hell said that we're not
savages,
and one last night I'll kiss your lips again

what did I say?
what could I say to put sister to sleep?
fall awake and die
and I'm never going to sleep

I will take the Ferris wheel
and I'm sleep walking back into this hell

oh my darling, for the first time

don't let me sleep tonight
and get in your way tonight
don't let me sleep tonight
get in your way

what did I say?
what could I say to put sister to sleep?
I'll never go to sleep
and I wont go back to bed

I will go into your bedroom
I'm sleepwalking back into this hell! oh! god!
