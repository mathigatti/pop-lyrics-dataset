[Chorus]
Im not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
Well walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, youre not alone
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road


[Intro]
Yeah, Its been a ride
I guess i had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If youre trying to get out, just follow me
Ill get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay em
But you wont take the sting out these words before I say em
Cause aint no way Im let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say em or do something I do it, I dont give a damn
What you think, Im doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, its gassed up, if it thinks its stopping me
Imma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me Im tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album hes still shittin and
Whether hes on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
Hes married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth hes got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole Universe

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ok quit playin with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldnt have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know its a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your feelings, instead of getting crowned youre getting capped
And to the fans, Ill never let you down again, Im back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Lets be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehhhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I aint going back to that now
All Im tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I aint playin around
Theres a game called circle and I dont know how
Im way too up to back down
But I think Im still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didnt
This fucking black clouds still follows me around
But its time to exercise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I just cant keep living this way
So starting today, Im breaking out of this cage
Im standing up, Imma face my demons
Im manning up, Imma hold my ground
Ive had enough, now Im so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And dont even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My World, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilitys as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldnt lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, Im strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause Im raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But Im too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and

[Chorus]
