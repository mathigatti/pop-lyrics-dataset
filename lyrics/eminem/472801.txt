Maybe I'm just not good enough for you
And maybe I just don't wanna be like you


And maybe I just don't wanna know
how low you're ready to go
I'm not gonna change
You can't make me

You don't mean anything to me
You're what I never want to be

Tell me does it feel good to be like you
Tell me why should I waste my time with you

'Cuz maybe you always bring me down
I'm sick of being pushed around
I'm not gonna change
You can't make me

I know you think you know me
You don't know anything
I know you want to help me
I don't need anything
Don't tell me where to go
I don't need you to know
