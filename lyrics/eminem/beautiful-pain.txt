I can feel the heat rising, everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter, the further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside (looking out, cause)


Sia:
I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake to start
The mourning process and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous asth-ma
Thunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it and poked its eye out
With the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the bright side, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted, never looking back
May hit the curb, but every day is a new learning curve, as you
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to, to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

Sia:
I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died, cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep cause you're weakened
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in, that's the only thing keeping
You from leaping off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And wit a little time that should do the healing, and by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em even after
All the shit you been put through, this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chilling, you look down
Cause you're so over 'em, you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling


As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire
From the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief, it's like watching the walls melt
In your prison cell, but you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream

Sia:
I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned, from fighting fights, that weren't mine
Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

Sia:
I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
