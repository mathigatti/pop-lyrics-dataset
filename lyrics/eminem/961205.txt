Things just ain't the same for psychos
Guns and rifles, sharp knifes, I like those
I might just O.D. by the end of tonight's show
With the right dose I might wipe out this life pole but
the strangest things can happen from jabbin'
Pregnant women in the abdomen so they can't have children
Bitches get slapped up and drastic ass kicks
Gay-bashin' fags with tire irons and ratchets {*zip*}
I seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Versace (Whoa, hey!) Liberace (ho!) {*echoes*}
I might of bashed somebody you probably know
Buncha faggots in your crib screamin' "It's not me! No!" {*echoes*}
Drag 'em out the closet and across the flo'
when you paid 'em a visit in the hospital
Stab 'em in the fuckin' tonsils with a popsicle stick
and sit back and watch 'em choke


'Cause every chair that I throw
people sue me for dough
They press charges on me
so I can't fight anymo'
But every girl that I choke
I got lawyers I know
Who got judges they know
so I suggest you stay home

Damn bitches, I just took some ecstasy

Cut that shit off, I'm outta here, peace
