Dear Diary~
Today I saw a boy and I wondered if he noticed
me. He took my breath away.
Dear Diary~
I can't get him off my mind and it scares me
'cause I've never felt this way. No one in this
world knows me better than you do, so diary I'll
confide in you.
Dear Diary~
Today I saw that boy. As he walked by I thought
he smiled at me. And I wondered does he know
what's in my heart? I tried to smile, but I
could hardly breathe. Should I tell him how I
feel or would that scare him away. Diary, tell
me what to do, please tell me what to say.
Dear Diary~
One touch of his hand now I can't wait to see
that boy again. He smiled and I thought my
heart could fly. Diary, do you think that we'll
be more than friends? I've got a feeling we'll
be so much more than friends.
