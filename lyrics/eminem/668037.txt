Cause we ain't going no never stop, you just keep wasting your energy 
On us, you should find something to do with your time (time) 
and quit fucking with us cause we ain't fucking with you 
and E must be fucking with you so much you must be gone out your mind 

They say I'm day away from my entire empire crumbling 
speak up your mumbling, what the fuck-a yousa bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby 
this is Shady I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away 
but weeble mable weeble wobble but we don't fall down like 
Jam Master Jay's two turn table, our lable is just too stable 
you're magazine so motherfucking thin you using staples 
to hold it together it's turning back into a news paper 
and yall got something for my ass every issue 
thank you, cause I keep running out of fucking tissues 
and I could diss you but god I was sick of looking at you 
at least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe 
but-but I guess no good news is always good good news 
moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera) 
50's blowing up, he should just keep showing up
what the fuck is going on? who the fuck is Norah Jones? 
Shady wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone 
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home 
Bush has declared the world a fucking war zone 
meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home 
my minds fucking blown, trying to figure out how to fight my own clone 
rhine stones are so nice, they shine so bright especially at night 
after a hit of ecstacy ain't that right? 
woahhhh wait a minute I'm rambling, back to the matter at hand 
it's Green Latern with Elvis Presley the selfish MC 
back to the ruin rap and destroy the industry 
single handedly and oh man did we, yeah me and 50 
Obie, me and D Tweezy 
and Nelly and Missy and Jigga god damn it's all a plan divised by the man 
It's a conspriracy...against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits 
or ain't dope lyrically, so fuck what you hear and what you read about 
we ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out 

Shady in the place to be see, and I got what it takes to rock the mic, aiight! 
still keep talking shit to me punk, cause your magazines over in less than 6 months! 
haha...Shady Records, still Aftermath 
and don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking, cause we can't 
we don't hear yall 
so we're just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives while you ride our dicks
