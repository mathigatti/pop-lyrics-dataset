[Eminem] Uh huh. Aight
[Fred Durst] Check
[Eminem] Slim Shady
[Fred Durst] Slim, Shady, to the mic kid 


[Eminem]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this {*Screech*}
With a slipped disk from a Limp Bizkit disc
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs don't attempt this shit
So step back while I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I says to this girl I'm like
"What up girl? Shut up girl"
Showed her a cut up squirrel
She screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her
Slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes kissin' on a futon
"Hey yo baby!" "What do you want?"
I looked at them both and I was like
"Uh check this out toots, I'm lookin' for cookie puss
I need to speak to him immediately"
They played my video on MTV last week
And just when I was thinkin' I was all that and then some in comes Fred Durst

[Fred Durst]
Yo Shady, let me get some!
Who knows what galaxy I came from
One where a bass drum's hung from a high-chair
Now I'm a nightmare
You stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound,
I got you cruisin' with your top down
These two blondes, I offered 'em both a drink
And this you would think could get the party started
But instead, them girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouths, smelled like somebody farted
So it was time for me to move on
Shady said the living room was a dance floor
So turn me loose
I was cuttin' a rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was drunk and a prick
Ramblin' on about how he was gonna kill me
Wow, I spilled a drink on his shirt!
But no, he insisted we should go
Before I could drop 'em, Shady had to clock 'em
The music stopped, the party stood in shock
So I looked around, grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf

CHORUS
Turn me loose, turn me loose, turn me loose
This party's goin' my way, or no way at all
Why don't you turn me loose, turn me loose, turn me loose
This party's goin' my way, or no way at all

[Eminem]
Turn me loose!
You better tell them to come re-shingle the roof
Just keep feedin' me free drinks till I puke
Fred'll ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sittin' in the bar, I'm not bein' approached
Cause Fred's over there, stealin' all of my hoes
"Yo Fred, save me some!"
I walked up to these siamese twins
Asked them to have a threesome
Told 'em two heads are better than one,
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up like: "Hey wait! Where you goin'?" "Bye!" 
Oh well, three strikes and I'm out
And I just struck out three times in a row
I ain't cryin' no more
Fuck it, I'm chillin'
Took a shot of Jaeger, fell asleep,
I was silly

[Fred Durst]
Who knows what galaxy I came from
One where a bass drum's hung from a high-chair
Now I'm a nightmare
You stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound,
I got you cruisin' with your top down
These two blondes, I offered 'em both a drink
And this you would think could get the party started
But instead, them girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouths, smelled like somebody farted
So it was time for me to move on
Shady said the living room was a dance floor
So turn me loose
I was cuttin' a rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was drunk and a prick
Ramblin' on about how he was gonna kill me
Wow, I spilled a drink on his shirt!

Chorus

Why don't you turn me loose, turn me loose, turn me loose
This party's goin' my way, or no way at all (repeat till fade)
