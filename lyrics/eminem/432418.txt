Mama, Papa forgive me

Out of sight
Out of mind
Out of time
To decide


Do we run?
Should I hide?
For the rest
Of my life

Can we fly?
Do I stay?
We could lose
We could fail

In the moment
It takes
To make plans
Or mistakes

30 minutes, a blink of an eye
30 minutes to alter our lives
30 minutes to make up my mind
30 minutes to finally decide

30 minutes to whisper your name
30 minutes to shoulder the blame
30 minutes of bliss, thirty lies
30 minutes to finally decide

Carousels
In the sky
That we shape
With our eyes

Under shade
Silhouettes
Casting shame
Crying rain

Can we fly?
Do I stay?
We could lose
We could fail
Either way
Options change
Chances fade
Trains derail

30 minutes, a blink of an eye
30 minutes to alter our lives
30 minutes to make up my mind
30 minutes to finally decide

30 minutes to whisper your name
30 minutes to shoulder the blame
30 minutes of bliss, thirty lies
30 minutes to finally decide

To decide
To decide, to decide, to decide

To decide
To decide, to decide, to decide

To decide
