Well I wanted you 
I wanted no one else 
I thought it through 
I got you to myself 
You got off 
Every time you got on to me 
I got caught up 
In favorable slavery 


Was it wrong? Was it wrong? 

[CHORUS] 
I guess it wasn't really right 
I guess it wasn't meant to be 
It didn't matter what they said 
'Cause we were good in bed 
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight 
for all the wrong reasons 
No, it didn't matter what I tried 
It's just a little hard to leave 
When you're going down on me 
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight 
for all the wrong reasons 

Well you know my friends 
Well they know your enemies 
I'd pretend 
Not to hear what they said to me 
'Cause I got off 
Every time you got on to me 
Was it wrong 
To go along with insanity? 

Was it wrong? Was it wrong? 

[CHORUS]
