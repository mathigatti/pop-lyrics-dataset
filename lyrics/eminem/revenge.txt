Like Leo in The Revenant
Bible in that bible bit
Revenge is sweet isn't it?
I really, reall hope ofr it
I know that it won't fix a thing
A song like this that I could sing for you
All the feels you make me do
A mightmare fucking coming true
I wish I was a lawyer, I would sue you, sue you
Take your dog, take your house, take your shoes, take your heart


Here comes that singing part

I'm daydreaming
Let me count the ways
How I'll get you, or how I'll make you pay
Babe, I'm hurting and now you'll feel the same
That's my plan
That's my plan
That's my plan

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
We could do revenge revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

Well here's where girlfriends come in hand
Especially those that understand
Crime's a crime but listen man
Really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing
Say the word we make it sting for him
He can't just get away with it
Eye for eye you piece of shit
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it, wait for it

Here comes that singing part

I'm daydreaming
Let me count the ways
How I'll get you, or how I'll make you pay
Babe, I'm hurting and now you'll feel the same
That's my plan
That's my plan
That's my plan

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
We could do revenge revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

Well in the beginning we felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee, but hell with any injury
Eventually you'll get up gingerly
It feels like it'll take a century to heal, but just know that I will
But fuck trying to make amends
I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium, your day begins at 8pm
You hit the atm in my mercedes benz with all your lady friends
Whores hit the club and you go out don't know a sum
'Cause when I calculate the times you cheated and total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up 'cause you say that just giving out your number doesn't count
Then see me with someone new get mad and flip it look bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me then tell me that I stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it slut so when you're driving, driving to his house
And you pass me while I'm driving to hers, just remember
You cheated on me first
You're a whore, you're a whore this is war

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
We could do revenge revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
