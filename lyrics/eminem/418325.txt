CHORUS
Songs for the bump, songs for the street
Niggas know the kinda tone when I'm on the beat
'cause if the rumbababum all in ya Jeep
These people know what I do with the empty seat


[Bizarre]
Hip Hop hip that's the way of life
Ya think ya nice? Then go grab the mic
Let me tell you my story, 'cause everybody got one
Grabbed a pen and pad and startin' to jot somethin'
Always told myself, that I would never be losin'
Man I ain't had no hood, my mother was always movin' (damn!)
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit
Goddamn mama, what's the point?
So I would go in my room, and pack my little bags
Jump in the truck, with my step dad
When I was 10 years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older metaphors got stronger
And me my rap partner wasn't seein' eye to eye
So we picked up and started a group with some other guys
This is Hip Hop, Hip man I won't stop
Yo Big Boi (what up?), gimme a beat box

Hip Hop Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop

Chorus

[Bizarre]
From the Hip Hop Shop to Maurice Malone
10 years later, I'm still in the zone
7 Mile off Runyon where a star was born
United we stand, divided we swore
And hell yeah, I lived in my car
Bitch I was homeless I would have slept in a jar
And Dirty Management, I wish y'all the best
But me and my niggas we had to do what's best
To lose the mess
All the taxes and accounts
Checks started to bounce we couldn't buy a ounce
And now that we platinum, they diss our name
Like we won't go to the car and get them thangs
And beef, sometimes you don't have a choice
To the fight with Whitey Ford to the beef with Royce
To the Ja Rules, Benzinos and the niggas in the club
To the E-Dubs and niggas that you ain't heard of
And man, I don't know how to use a gun
But I'll learn quick if the fuckin' beef come

Hip Hop Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop

Chorus

[Eminem]
Man I thought this was supposed to be hip hop hip hop
I'd rather be fishin' in flip flops flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock did, I
can't see no country singers beefin' over some guitar riff
That Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seger
When I was younger I was so eager to have a gun
I would do the same, I couldn't wait to get to the shooting range
Me and my man goofy Gary would just try to let off some steaaaammmmm
Motherfuckers laughin' 'cause I couldn't aim
So I pulled the fuckin' target closer and just shoot the thang
I used to have this theory, keep 3 bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no CCW license
I tried to apply for one, they said it'd take 5-6 months
What the fuck am I supposed to do mean time when rivals come
Hide that son of a bitch in the glove box or inside the trunk
Now, back to what my 3 bullet theory was
I'm triple platinum I ain't tryna catch no murder one
Figured I'd shoot to wound probably miss with at least one
But them other two gon' fuck his shoulder and his knee cap up
Them I'ma say self defense how come I had the gun
Was because I was at the range on the way back from
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I get a year from each bullet at the most as opposed to havin' a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic it was basically for safety
But it gave me power and it made me crazy
And psychotic I just got retarded, once I got up and gotta
It was empty the night I got caught with it
What the fuck man I thought this was supposed to be...
