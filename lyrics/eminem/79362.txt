CLUE! [Method Man]
Niggaz is like "Oh my God not you!"
Yes I'm in the flesh like hollow heads through your vest
No contest, M.E.-Eth Man's obsessed
With sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll
New tecs and calicos!
Word has it we move mathematic on rappers
Who don't add up, you get broke, battered and slapped up
8 million stories in the nekkid call yo man Method
Straight guerilla iller nigga kill a murder record
My verbal shooter does it to ya
The 16-bar Ruger, bustin' yo funky dope manuevers
But I'm not ya Super Lover Cee, I'm the Super Sperm
Splash it on your skin rub it in like it's Lubriderm
10 out of 10 I'll be the...
Men of all men I mean the...
Creme de la creme a schemer...
Sippin' on 'Gnac and Zima...
True professional 2...
Now that Bush is president nigga we all through[DJ Clue]
Wooooooooooord![Eminem]
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
Why I keep on duckin' under the bed when I hear thunder
Cuz I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby
I like that!  I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, there'll be just as many muthafuckin' murderers
And heroin users without Marlilyn's music
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it!
Now the parents are suein' cuz little Darren is screwin'
Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
Cuz of me?  Two 12-year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's 'fuck it' like Pac's was at one point
Wanna come join?  Pick up a glock and just point
Now everybody's killin' everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughin' like it's funny
Cause I don't really give a shit about no-muthafuckin'-body
I'm so muthafuckin' nutty I don't give a fuck about nuttin'![Royce Da 5'9"]
My wrist is...water and freeze
And mix this is...audio Jesus the repent shit gets big
Keep it sharp like knife in a pop device
So "Duro you gotta let it bump!", I came from a hard knock life
They say this kid be rude like this can't be true 
I suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed
Vampire, sun go down I'm still wylin'
Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins
Rock City baby knife through your throat 'til you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all-a my dogs wit' me
And they all rich, and still all-a they palms itchy
We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge
Walkin' like we talkin' drunk while we stumble over words
Clue ...Duro...Slim...Meth...
Five...Nine...Hold up...breath[Method Man]
It's just...Mr. Meth and DJ Clue
