Fuck that!
Who run shit, watch these drums hit
You dove head first into some old dumb shit
Here's a can of ass whip, for you to come get
Your clique made their trip, I made them hoes submit
Ask your girl, she knows the scoop don't fuck with Bugz bitch
I'll chop off her titty, have you sucking one tit
Them pink belly niggas is who you run wit'
Making half ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate your damn sound, don't like it one bit
You can make a double album, won't have one hit
Your entire outfit is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't out wit'
I admit, that my style is unfit
For mamma's baby boy because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit arsony, get harm quick
You pull the alarm switch, I'll stab you in your armpit
Now who the nitwit wanna come get wit'
This egotistic, hip hop fundal-mentalisitic
Don't risk it, you'll get your shit split
Now keep your distance, and keep existence
I'm the persistent when it comes to bench shit
I smoked a blunt with my judge before my sentence
I'm relentless to deny you're senseless
Yo bitch, pay my bill that's where the hell your rent went
Fuck that! {*Gun shot*}
