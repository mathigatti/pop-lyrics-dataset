[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now
Got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship save it bitch, babysit? you make me sick
Superman aint savin shit, girl you can jump on shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell em off like a slut to her face
Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash, i'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? i'll put you out
Won't get out? i'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin to be, my new wife?
What you Mariah? fly through twice
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through sunday monday
Monday through sunday yo
Maybe i'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe... 


[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Cry me a river 
Cry me a river er er 
cry me a river 
cry me a river er er 
YA YA 

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong
I love these hoes
It's no secret
Everybody knows
Yeah we fucked
Bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends
I'll call you again,
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car i'll be in
[Woman Screaming]
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that
Neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride
Between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
Never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe... 

[Eminem:]
I know you want me baby
I think I want you too... 

[Dina Rea:]
I think I love you baby... 

[Eminem:]
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in shady's world
I wanna grow together
Lets let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in shady's world...

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Cry me a river 
Cry me a river er er 
cry me a river 
cry me a river er er 
YA YA 

[Versen 3: Eminem]
First thing you said... 
I'm not phazed,
I hang around big stars all day,
I don't see what the big deal is anyway,
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me... 
Ooh yeah girl run that game... 
Hailie Jade...I love that name,
Love that tattoo...what's that say?
'rot in pieces' aww that's great... 
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good lordy-wody you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe... 

[Eminem &amp; Dina Rae: Over Chorus x2]

[Eminem:]

[Dina Rea:]

[Eminem:]
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Lets let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in shady's world... 

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Cry me a river 
Cry me a river er er 
cry me a river 
cry me a river er er
