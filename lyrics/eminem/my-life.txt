(Adam Levine)
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try


(50 Cent)
Yeah, 03, I went from back filthy to filthy rich
Man, the emotions change
So I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on
They turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck, both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em
It may sound like it's some other shit
Cause I'm not writing anymore, they not making hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money is evil look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doing what I'm supposed to
I'm a writer, I'm a fighter
Entrepeneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me manoeuver
What's it to ya?
The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid

(Adam Levine)
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

(Eminem)
While you were sipping your own kool-aid
Getting your buzz heavy
I was in the fucking sheds sharpening my machete
Sipping some of of that revenge juice
Getting my taste buds ready
To whoop down this spaghetti
Or should I say this spaghett-even?
I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting
Thought he was finished, motherfucker
it's only the beginning
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin'
Fuck who he's offending
He'll rip your vocal chords out
And have them bitches plugged in me
Motherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end, dump them
Then pluck them motherfuckers
In each one of your eyesockets cause I thought
You might finally fucking see
That'll teach you to go voicing
Your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit
Fuck letting up
You're gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me
Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah
It's happening again
I'm thinking about the same
Mother fuck everybody that's up in this bitch, but 50!
'Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this
More than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap,
But everytime I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh, oh
I guess it's bubble wrap
This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know
Shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm going psycho again
And I might just blow my lid, shit
I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
'Cause I'm running in circles with

(Adam Levine)
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

(50 Cent)
I haven't been this fucking confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records
People forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it 3 AM in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers
I'm on fire like a lighter
Tryna say the same classic
Get your ass kicked
Man crook, wrap your head up in plastic
Pussy, now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
It's tragic, it's sad it's
Never gonna end, now we number one again
With that frown on your face, and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it
This a gift God gave me like the air in the lungs
And every fucking thing with it

(Adam Levine)
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try
