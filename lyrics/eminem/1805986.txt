They ask me am I ok. they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the sh-t thats been thrown at me
Or am I just a little snappy
And they genuinly care
Doody, most of my life its just been me and you there
And i continuosly stare at pictures of you
I never got to say i love you as much as i wanted to but i do
Yeah i say it now and you can't hear me
What the f-ck good does that do me now
But somehow i know you're near me in presence
Or i went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
Two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
And dawg you'll never believe this
But sharonda actually talks to me now
Jesus and everyone elese is just tryna pick up the pieces
Man how you touch so many lives and just leave us
They say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
If its true how the f-ck am i supposed to get over you
Difficult as it sounds


Doody, thats what we call eachother
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
We was always brothers
Never thought about eachothers skin colours
Til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees i was catching a sun burn
Tryna walk under the trees
Just to give me some comfort
I'm moaning i just wanna get home
When i look over in his shirt is off
I'm like you gon fry and like
No i wont, i'm black stupid
Black people they got melatonin
And their skin don't burn
Meanwhile, my face is glowing and i felt
Like i'm on fire
And the entire time you're just laughing at me
And snapping at me with your shirt bastard
And i still have to get you back for that sh-t
And by the way them playboy rings
My mother stole from you
Well i finally got em back sh-t
It must have been at least 16 years ago
Well i put em in your casket
Moving past it, it still aint registered yet
But you can bet you're legacy they'll never forget
The motor city mo-town
Hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads
It don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds

And this might sound a little strange but i'mma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
And i picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so i can always look at it
And as for me and d12 we feel like f-ck rap
It feels like our general just f-cking died in our lap
We shut off all our pages,
All our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash
So some cats will have to find a new way
And i know the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is there all still here and you aint
Purple gang, you gotta press on
Don't ever give up the dream dog
I got love for you all
And doody, it's true you bought people together who never
Woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker doody
I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation
And truly hated the feuding
But you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
If it had to happen, it had to happen
Believe me, i know you're the one who taught me to
Throw them balls back on dresden
From making cars to paintballing
To getting arrested
To sitting across from eachother in cells laughing and jesting
They tried to hit us for 5 years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
Didn't show up for court
So we got off on a technicality, left sweating
Me, you and whats his face
I forgot his f-cking name
Shame he even came to your funeral
He betrayed our team
And if i see him again i'mma punch him in the f-cking face
And thats on hallie jade, whitney lane and alaina's name
I let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
For you and pour some liquor out for you with obie in the parking lot of 54
Just before we were supposed to get in cars
To come and see you
It's more difficult as it sounds
