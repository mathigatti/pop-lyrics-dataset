What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough
If you want to be saved not in a religious sense
But we have to constitute what this country?? For if only children
We seem to be approachin an age of the gross (burp)
We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station
And each generation should a little better


Eminem
Alright come on, let's cut this bullshit, enough
Let's get it started let's start addressing this issue and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss statements
That's made on this tape and its whole origin of
The music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy
The music that you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was boy
On the east side of detroit crossin' 8 mile into warren
Into hick territory. I'd like to share a story
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well aware that I don't belong here
You made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From bel-air shoppin' center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Ok there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it hauling my ass
Through that patch of grass
Over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks
Them old railroad tracks, them good old notorious so well known tracks

Chorus
So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

I'd roam the streets so much they called me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift ta
8 Mile and van dyke or steal a God damn bike
From somebody's back yard and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark
To meet kim
At to walk
Back to her momma's on chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my moms
That's about the time, I first met proof with goofy gary on the steps at osbourne handin out some flyers
We was doin' some talent shows at centerline high
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on that same shit that big daddy kane shit where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

My first year in 9th grade, cant' forget that day of school
It was cool till your man MC shan came through
And said that puma's the brand cause the klan makes troops
It was rumors but man God damn they flew
Musta been true because man we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones the cool j ice lambs, suede too
But we just threw em' in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X-clan debuted
Professor x "vanglorious, exist in a state of red, black and green with a key, sissies"
Now with this being the new trend, we don't fit in
Crackas is out with cactus albums blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man howard and butter would go to the mall
With 'em all over our necks like were showin' 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was being laughed at
You ain't even half black you ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
And that flava flaw clock
We gonna have to snatch that
All I remember is meetin' back at
Mannix's basement, sayin' how we hate this
How racist but dope the x-clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in '89 me
And kim broke up for the first time she was tryin' to two-time me
And there was this black girl at our school who thought I was cool
Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyeing me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even gonna say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
And a pair of jugs the bombest goddamn
Girl in our whole school
If I could pull her not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss kim off at the
Same time but it backfired, I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to
The ole' foolish pride girl but I heard
People say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was, I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize, I was wrong
Cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
