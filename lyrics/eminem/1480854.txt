[Intro]
Oh my goodness! What have I done! Oh no! I Can't believe it!
It's like... I've got the whole world in my palm! 
And I'm ready to DROP BOMBS!


[Verse 1]
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca Rebecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
It's my sector, homosexual disector, come again, rewind selecta!
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lector and a guy sex and I bet ya
I tantlize you and in less than 5 seconds I get ya
They say once bitten, and twice shy
Well I'm next to the guy with nine ecstacy pills and 5 extra
Boxes of ripped condoms in quantities, why yes sir
I took the rest of the lunesta pills from my dresser
It's my kinda vibe, what else should I try Lester
Drop kicked the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with dexter then I guess I
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends

[Verse 2]
All my westside bitches throw it up
Put a baloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
Man i think that he just fell off the teet and show enough
You better change the station to keep from throwin' up
Man you've seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor with two balls, so you know who did it
You know you're with it girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I'm won't rape all the pussycat dolls, nicole you kidding
I pee on Rihanna see man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the Sauna room, crazy glueing Madonna to
The lazy boy sofa fold her in two, then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that man, who woulda thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she out lived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends

[Verse 3]
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it and push him and lead him right into quick sand
Here, you need a hand big man, grab hold of this branch
Woith both hands, man they don't understand, I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me
Like it's my fault this name rhymes with so many different words, Jeez!
So one last time Mr. Christoper Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse please!
"Eminem, I'm coming to kill you, always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far, who do you think you are
Hang my suit up in the armior
Everyday I hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard
Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore"

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends

[Outro]
The world is mine!
