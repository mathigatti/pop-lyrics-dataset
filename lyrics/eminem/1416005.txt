I done figured this rap shit out I map shit out strategically 
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key 
To my success it's worked from me repeatably
Let 'em diss your first then respond immediatley 
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war 
Shit not no more we done scared 'em off there are no more 
Victims this sick, I'm fixin' to pick some to start shit 
I'm out of pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at 
Ain't go no more targets
Shit irv and jeff we beat 'em to death, benzino in debt
It seems to just be no one left to bully 
Bush is pussy, why the fuck you think his name is bush? Puss is bushy 
Ain't shit goin on. Shit I been gettin' so bored latley
I'm thinking of doing some shit to get you to go hate me again 
To tell the truth I like the shit better then 
Shit I could spit better, about to kick that sick shit again 
Look, the game just ain't the same its changin 
Shit Dre's quittin', Jay's quittin', now it just wankstas 
Just sayin' the same shit, its fake and its ancient 
It's making me so bored I'm gonna just make a new language 
Fubba you cova cubba, ubba you ubba ooba 
Youba can subbabick my dadibbabick through a tuba 
sum other luma lama 
I'm not a human I'ma a suicidal supersonic suicidal uni-bomber 
you think im the new Osama 
Press thinks I'm the new madonna 
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on 
Alot of talk and rumors on us who's the hottest to be honest 
Hip-hop ain't been the same since Tupac moved to Cuba on us
