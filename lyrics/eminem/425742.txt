Like an angel, fly over your house 
Like an angel, pass out wishes 
Like an angel, I will move the arrow 
Like an angel, I live alone.. 
Im not livin what was promised 
I am close but cant enjoy.. 
Oh, Im not dying 
Oh, Im so tortured 
Cause I see all 
Tortured, and all I cannot do 
Tortured, all I should have done 
Tortured, while I occupied a man.. 
Im not livin what was promised 
I am far from glorified.. 
Oh, Im not dying 
Oh, Im not alone... 
Mind is not a celestial state 
With idle hymns of praise 
Time is short, I have an appointment at noon 
At noon in hell.. 
Across the waste of space and fields of air 
I glide, alone at night 
Oh please, please think of me 
Cause Im, Im by your side... 
Im by your side... Im by your side... 
Ohhh.. Im, Im right in front of you.. 
Im by your side.
