Oooh!
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds,
with a record of 17 rapes,
400 assaults, and 4 murders,
the undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world,
Slim Shady!


So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many
of us.
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from
dusk.

OK, OK. Let's Go!

Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk.
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust .
Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus.
Kiss my butt. Lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts.
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed (?).
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Missed the cut. The lady give a (?) some paper cut.
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the **** gets worse and worcertshire
sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say with the same repetition is true
Not to mention back with a vengeance and hit the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio is back on you hoes.

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don't act like a snobby model .
You just hit the lotto.
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us.
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from
dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

They see that low rider go by there, like "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I'll be dammed, just ****** around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end.
Let's cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable.
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado.
The hell if I know
do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions. Garage looks like precision collision
Or maico beats quake like Waco.
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though.

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don't act like a snobby model .
You just hit the lotto.
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us.
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk.

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marajuaun do what you want

Nigga on and on 'till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat ass burgundy bags, classy shit
Jimmy Cho shoes I say move a bitch move

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many
