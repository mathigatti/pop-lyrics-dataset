Arise as did the gods ninti
Arise as did the gods ninti
Arise as did the gods ninti, and ishkur!

Clock men for they will FAIL!
Fear not the gods that come from the SKY!
Long not for the one who've lost their WAY!
Long not for the one who've lost their WAY!

Arise as did the gods ninti,
Arise as did the gods ninti,
Arise as did the gods ninti, and ishkur, ishkur Mother-Fucker!

Could.. You.. Love.. Me?
I.. Don't.. Know.
