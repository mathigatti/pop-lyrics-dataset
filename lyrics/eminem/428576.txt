On the edge windowsill
Ponders his maker
Ponders his will
To the street below
He just aint nothin
But he's got a great view
And he sings


Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom

On the edge of a
Know-nothing town
Feeling quite superior
The aged come
To the sky above
He just aint nothin
But he's got a great view
And he sings....

Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep

On the edge of a
Christmas clean love
Young virgin from heaven visiting
To the man above her
She just aint nothing
She doesn't like the view
Doesn't like the view
Doesn't like the view
But he sinks himself deep

Can't touchthe bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom
Can't touch the bottom
Deep
