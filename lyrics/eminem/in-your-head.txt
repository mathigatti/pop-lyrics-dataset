In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

I'm backing up my shit
Smoke shit in the cars
I can fit and I'm just driving as far as I can get
Away from these problems, to all my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm starting life again
Kids in the corner won't stop fucking my ignoring
Besides psycho when I fantasize
Starting my whole life over, yeah right
Oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive because there's nothing like
Holding your head up high when you're dead inside
And I just hide so in, case you're wondering why my insides showing
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and know some minds so I'm
Picking them up and stuff them in the back
Fuck it I've done enough in this rap shit, Recovery brought me nothing
But back, to where I was and perhaps
This could've been my victory lap if I wasn't on the verge of Relapse

[The Cranberries]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Eminem]
It seems to be the reoccurring main thing
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
Is it though amazing, back then I put eight thing
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy, or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Blame me, I did it—did what?—Hailie
Baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent, of what I rapped about
Maybe, I should've did a better job at separating
Shady, and entertaining, for real life, but this
Dang thing, is still the hardest thing to explain
Is the crazy, or should I?
Ever seen it back then, it was like I ain't even
Bother to taken into consideration
You and [?] baby and older and make, hear me say things
I did it, pay me, and be, it just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen [?] berate everything
Is the main reason that I, feel like a lame piece of shit
Or should I start cranking in bitter
Come playing beef and pick up by the same things
'Cause when I, look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel the same greedy and lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get a ranger or whatever this road takes me
It's making me crazy, what's in my?

[The Cranberries]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
