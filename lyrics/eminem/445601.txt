The minute before we play
I'm pacing waiting anxiously 
I Can't wait to hit the stage 
And say hello to Jersey
And when the last note rings
And I've sung all i have to sing
Every minute i will count
The next show in the next town


What can i say
That can explain 
All this time i'm loving life
Theres not a day that i can say 
All this time i'm living out my...

The feelings screaming out 
The words of things i think about
Hearing them coming back 
From the crowds mouth is perfect
And when the curtains close
I realize how fast time can go
Thanks for everything you know how much this means

What can i say
That can explain 
All this time i'm loving life
Theres not a day that i can say 
All this time i'm living out my
Dream

What this is to me 
Is more than words could mean
I guess dreams do come true 
This song it self is living proof

What this means to me is 
more than it may seem 
I guess dreams do come true 
This song it self is living proof

What this is to me 
Is more than words could mean
I guess dreams do come true 
This song it self is living proof

What can i say
That can explain 
All this time i'm loving life
Theres not a day that i can say 
All this time i'm living out my
Dream
