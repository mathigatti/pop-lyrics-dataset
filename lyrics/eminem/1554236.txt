It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne


Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy ain't nothing to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, Chemo
Drop the mix tape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness
Bitches.

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne

I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams, just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
when a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin'
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne

Ok, hello it's the martian, space jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the Garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess im just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Little Wayne thats what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne

There they go, back in stadiums, as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go, so ballistic woah
We can make them look like bozo's
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He aint had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinnochio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings, 'til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case your thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake?.

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
