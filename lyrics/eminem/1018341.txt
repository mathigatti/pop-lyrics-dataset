ersonal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I´m gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've gotta to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry


Like a little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine
Valentine
Yes you can hold my hand if you want to
'cause I wanna hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself in center, clarity
Peace, Serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I´m gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've gotta to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry,
Don't cry,
Don't cry
