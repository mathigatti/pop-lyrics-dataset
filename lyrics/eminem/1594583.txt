Yeah
Yeah, girl
Can you hear that? It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?


You hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door; it's locked, so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums; oh, look
Here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placing hot, smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em; he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBen√©t Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

I almost look comatose; who wants to be sober? Gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

I'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin'
This little chick's neck like a Pixy Stick
The sick, Satan-worshippin' bitches get horse whippings
I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above
Forced entry, the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doing this for more than a quarter-century, I'm just numb
Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
With a bat; a matter of fact, that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back, like " Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula "
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that: Cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?
