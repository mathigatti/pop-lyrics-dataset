Intro: (Obie Trice)
â€œObie Trice, real name no gimmicksâ€¦â€


Refrain 1
2 trailer park girls go round the inside, round the
inside, round the inside 
(Repeat Refrain 1)

Refrain 2
Guess who's black, black again? Smiley's black,
tell a friend. Guess who's 
black, guess who's black, Guess who's black, guess
who's black, Guess who's 
black, guess who's black, guess who's black

Verse 1
I've created a monster, cuz nobody wants to see
Shady no more 
They want Smiley I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Smiley, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of seeds mixed with some hard liquor
Some binaca that'll jumpstart my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the Hospital
By the Dr. when I'm not cooperating
When he's rocking the table while I'm masturbating
(Hey!)
You waited this long so stop debating
Cuz I'm back, I'm on a fag and ejaculating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me leave, or let me be me so
watch me flee
They tried to shut me down on EmTV, but it feels so
empty with Smiley
So come on you prick, jump on a dick rotate, on the
dick and suck some dick
And get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy 
I just got in all cop pursuits, â€œFUCK YOU DEBBIE!â€

Chorus x2
Now this ain't like a job for me
So everybody just let me be
Cuz we need a little penis envy
Cuz it feels so empty with Smiley

Verse 2
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoner's pelvis
â€˜Till someone comes along a mission and yells
â€œdickâ€
A missionary, vision is scary, could start a
resolution
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and tact, in the fact that I got
everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask Smiley?
Well, I'm black
(Batman sound) Fix your bent antennae tune it in and
then I'm gonna enter in 
and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of perfection, back for the winter I'm
interesting
The less thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and resting
Testing â€œAttention Pleaseâ€ feel the tension soon
as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents and my ass cheeks are free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent Smiley?

Chorus x2

Verse 3
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's taking this shit that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass flipped
Worse than â€˜em little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get bombed by Dolby
This 36-year-old bald headed fag sold me
He don't know me, he's too old, let it go, move
over, nobody listens to Techno
Now let's go, just give weed the signal, I'll be
there with a whole crew full 
of new imbeciles
I've been doped, suspenseful with a pencil ever since
Prince turn himself into 
a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems, everybody only
wants to disgust me
So this must mean I'm Smite Smiley
But it's just me I'm just smiling
Though I'm not the first queen of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black Music so selfishly
And use it to get myself healthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers submerge
But it matters how many fish in the sea
When it will be so empty with Smiley

Chorus x2
