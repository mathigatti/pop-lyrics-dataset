Eminem Vs. Papa Doc (Ãºltima batalha de 8 Mile)


Now everybody from the 313
Put your muthafuckin' hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313
Put your muthafuckin' hands up
Look Look


Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
The free worlds got you gassed up?
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1 Pac , 2 Pac, 3 Pac, 4
4 Pac, 3 Pac, 2 Pac, 1
You're Pac, He's Pac, you're Pac, None!
This guy aint no muthafuckin MC
I know everything he's got to say against me
I am white
I am a fuckin bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin here screamin fuck the free world!!
Don't ever try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck i've been through
But i know something about you
You went to Cranbrook that's a private school
What's the matter dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangsta? his real name's Clarence
Clarence lives at home with both parents
Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle he shook
'Coz aint no such thing as HALF WAY CROOKS!!
He's scared to death
He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook fuck Cranbrook

Fuck a beat i go acapella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly
Fuck this battle
I don't wanna win
I'm outty
Here tell these people something they don't know about me
