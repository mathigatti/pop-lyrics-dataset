Ready to embrace the day 
As we both break,
As the light stole in
She found me wide awake.Wasted from a sleepless night
I reach to touch your hair,
Withdraw an empty hand
For you're no longer thereIn between the silence, living is an empty space
Save the ticking of the clock
As the hands are sweeping past it's faceAnd I just don't wanna be lonely
(O no no)
Night and day
'Cos as I look around me I just feel that way(Repeat chorus)For you onlyI turn my hand to something that will clear my head
But I cannot forget the parting words we shared
I open up my mind to all the pictures I can trace
But I cannot recall, the contours of your faceAnd though we slipped away
Before I had the chance to say,
If I did something wrong
Please tell me I'll accept the blame.And I just don't wanna be lonely 
(O no no)
Night and day
'Cos as I look around me I just feel that way(Repeat chorus)For you onlyFor you only
