Should i have a taste of this
Run across your lips
And start all over again


Could this all just be a dream

Chorus)
If i should fall to stormy weather
Wake me, wake me

Maybe this time i can do it all right
Without my foot in my mouth
Without that blind in my sight

Could this all just be a dream

(chorus)

Too scared to lose the one
I tried so hard for
Too scared to lose the one
I never had
