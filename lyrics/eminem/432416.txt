I don't wanna make this 
Harder than I have to 
This is how it has to be 
There's so many things I want to say 
But you just don't listen to me 


I don't want to hurt you 
You don't want to hurt me 
I can't stand you 
And you can't stand me 
We can't rearrange 
You can never change me 
Say goodbye 
Nothing I say could change your mind because 

[Chorus:]
I can't stay 
Tomorrow I'll be on my way 
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed 
'Cuz when you wake up 
I won't be there
I won't be there

Everything I say 
You find a way to make it 
Sound like I was born just yesterday 
Everything you taught me 
Doesn't mean a thing
So I'm going my way 

I don't want to hurt you 
You don't want to hurt me 
I can't stand you 
And you can't stand me 
We can't rearrange 
You can never change me 
Say goodbye 
Nothing I say could change your mind because

[Chorus]

This is the last night 
That I spend at home 
And it won't take too long 
For you to notice 
Won't take long for you to find out 
That I'm gone 

[Chorus x2]
