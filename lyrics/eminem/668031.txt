Proof:] 
Now everybody throw your hands in the air 
[Eminem:] 
Put 'em up put 'em up 


[Verse 1 Eminem:] 
I'm smacking, upslash, and keep the hoes in checking, 
dubble last Slim Shady, this is real shit. 
Sit back, relax, when my boys smocks crack. 
I'm the big master, [Proof:] Can't u see thaaaat ?? 
Aww, yes I'm from the mothafuckin´ Wild west. 
Lift your shirt up, and tell me who's real best? 
Everlast, girls three times at day three times at night, 
I got G's full of criminals peooople, 
Shut u down for revange, G. 
Beat u down as we all know I do G. 
Brothers like, Eminem change the stylaa. 
Shut the fuck up I feel high for this SLUUUUTT! 
Like everytimes smoke the herion. 
Get back in this day shit and feel for more crack like kokain. 
Listen, must we repeat ? 
I'm not the one who write about bullshit, 
and sell those drug shit, and fuck mothafuckas´ who say that I'm talking shit. 
Detroit sidney is where I grew up bitch. 
Now peace for all my outsiders, and this world. 
Fuck what u want this is three one third. 

[Chorus:] 
Put 'em up yaaa put 'em up put 'em up. 
Say dr.dre (DR.DRE) dr.dre (DR.DRE) 

[Verse 2:] 
One two three and to the four, 
Snoop Doggy Dog, and dre is after ya. 
Ready to fight? go and get your back up. 
And we about to fuck u upppp.. 
Gimme the microphone first, so I can fly like a bubble. 
All those peices together, yo u know you're in trouble. 
I'm sayin´ nuttin but he says : (Fuck Dre). 
We beat him G, so : (feel okay). 
But back to the old shit and make this to a end. 
Nervous is nervous, something u can't understand. 
You never know my wife maybe could hurt a man. 
Burn a man, and last thing, feel for learn this man. 
And when she learn, I chill for a minute. 
Ain't no bitch ass pussy on my fuckin´ penis. 
And thats really horny so my penis got harder, 
Stronger bigger, so hard u wanna fuck her. 
[Eminem &amp; Proof:] PEACE!!
