Now i don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know 'em
I roll like a desperado, now i never know where i'm gonna go
Still i ball like there's no tomorrow ...


Your staring straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate, not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait sarah you're late, your train left.
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye, hoe i thought that i told ya'
The spilled nut aint nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within range of my rover
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as i rolled up,
Any chick who's dumb enough out there i blind fold her,
She still comes back to my crib, must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller. but i wont buy her a soda
Unless it's rock n' roll cola. buy u a bag of fritos
I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and i was hair i wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up i'm on my straight grizzly
So why would i buy you a gayass teddy bear,bitch you're already bi-polar

Now i don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know 'em
I roll like a desperado, now i never know where i'm gonna go
Still i ball like there's no tomorrow ...

Man tip told me on this hoe tip,
Best tip i could give you to hip you
Never let these traits trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think i love slut, shit
Dig you a hole, take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some adivce that sticks with you
If i should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, its you but fuck 'em tip,
Its cold its chilling like and feeling like the penguin
In it's fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
Before i tie a fucking knot i'd tie you in one bitch
You think this is some nintendo game how f-cking dumb
Is you i'll give you some mumps before i split some lump somes with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts
But it won't buy you a chesseburger, although a nickle might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle i got a trust issue
Thats a bombshell, scud missle! i got this cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before i rap there was some motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle
I still live like i bought you the gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So fuck sissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister

Now i don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know 'em
I roll like a desperado, now i never know where i'm gonna go
Still i ball like there's no tomorrow ...

I guess life is a bitch aint it tip
And each one thinks they the shit shirt off my back?
I wouldn't give you the dirt off my hankercheif
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it i'm sure you got that relationship memo by now,
But in case you didnt imma stick this whole pad full of
Sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and i got no time to sit around just wasting it
So i pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock i'm racing and double timing it
But i still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like stretch armstrong man
I still say k-mart like theres an apostrophe "s" on it dog
And they say mcdonalds isn't a restaurant well
I guess i'm wrong but if you gon tell me that the a&amp;w
Aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "f" on dawg
