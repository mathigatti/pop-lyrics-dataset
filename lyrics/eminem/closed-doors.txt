This time for the relapse
This room it feels lonely
Guess i was the only
The only damm fool to get caught in the trap
Feels like a slap
Disrespected the slim shady code
Back in my real mode
Nothing will stop me from the recovery
My life is a discovery
When they left me out do dry
But what the fuck they go and cry
And now im back in the waiting room
I nearly fuckin fell to my doom
Now you are the one that will pay
But my life might not have another day


So i sit in this room
With these words in my head
Im dying and i will never come back
Im closing my eyes
But they gonna make me walk again
And i can be the slim shady man
God just wont let me in
And i just wait there under these closed doors
Under these fuckin closed doors

Seriously
What the hell were you thinking
You made me be something im not
But now im coming in
And i will break your damm door down
And then little pig ill slice your throat
You will bow down to my mercy when i take over
This game feels harder
But i lever up and get stronger
You can never feel the way i feel
Cause im feeling like crap
Not popular and stupid and the jerk in the trash
Yeah that was the old me
But honestly it wasnt the real me
The real me was inside me

But you captured it and left it on your balcony
You gonna get what you deserved all these years

So i sit in this room
With these words in my head
Im dying and i will never come back
Im closing my eyes
But they gonna make me walk again
And i can be the slim shady man
God just wont let me in
And i just wait there under these closed doors
Under these fuckin closed doors

Why did i get myself into the situation
Im a jersey shore im a total party
Part pretty, part perfect im a complete package
I get phone calls from guys in every nation
My secret was some fairy dust
Got it from tinker bell
Traded it for a golden globe
Im the bomb diggity
Yep the only everything
Yes yes yes i am
You cant catch me im the greatest deal.

So i sit in this room (room)
With these words in my head (do it)
Im dying and i will never come back (never)
Im closing my eyes (closing)
But they gonna make me walk again (again)
And i can be the slim shady man (dre)
God just wont let me in (im bad)
And i just wait there under these closed doors (closed)
Under these fuckin closed doors (closed)
