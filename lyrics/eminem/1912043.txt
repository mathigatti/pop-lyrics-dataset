Oh, Dr Dre. Or should I say Dr Gay.
You are very bad man, you diss the wrong motherfucker
You think Osama won't diss you, black biatch


Things just ain't the same for Osama
Since the World Trade Bombings
And the Pentagon got the world calling
Me to kill all of congress, like (blurred)
The Strangest things can happen to an Afghan
When people get wrapped up in Islam and Allah
Then some shiteaters fly planes and wreak havoc
Then go drop the blame on Bin Laden
Now I got a faggot-ass rapper attacking me
With this gangsta rap, like I'm not gonna battle
Dr Dre? The man wasn't done shit since NWA
And gave Eazy-E AIDS
Don't make shoot night on your fat ass
You homofuck, you ain't the only one goin' platinum
Osama Bin Laden, keeping it gangsta
Fuck Dr Dre, I'm the Aftermath

Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before
People I used to know just don't know me no more
And everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who've got people they know, so I suggest you lay low

Oh, Dr. Dre, look at you, you fool
I use your own rap against you, and I'm better
Lick my balls, til they are dry
Sorry, come again
Things just ain't the same for Bin Laden
This planet hates me more than Michael Jackson
Hating on the Taliban for keeping me captive
Threatening to find my little cave and blast it
Now I've got to worry about this wannabe gansta
Who pays other rappers to write his wack shit
Everyone knows that your beats are helped man
And you'll never blow by yourself man
Sorry, you'd blow, blow cocks
Use the hole as a straw and blow sperm out your nostrils
I don't give a hurried fuck, call Slim Shady
Snoop Dogg, D.O.C, Wren and Jay-Z
To write a verse, fuck I'll do it for ya
You still lick dick, this is Booshu Babara
Do you know who, do you know what, do you know who?
Let's keep this between me and you

Osama
Osama
Oooosama
O-o-o-osama
Bitch
