[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I get to busting like I’m a thirty ought six
When I’m ripping the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him pretty hot
Cause he knowin that Tecca Ninna’s a dirty chopper
He’s handle, holmes, here’s a handful
How in the hell he hovering having hella go H.A.M. though?
I said to Seven, "Richie Havens'll be the man"
So we put it together thinking Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, "What we doin'?" I said to 'im, "Let's chop"
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another choppers comin' so let's rock, nigga
You're on, people got to wondering if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer making a tour strong
If you thinking of battling - you're gone!


Krizz Kaliko:
Nobody can catch up meetin' Speedy Gonzales
The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I’ve got to audibly body them
This is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain’t ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
(Then I let 'em melt)
They never heard of us, but look at 'em turnin' up
I slap the shirt off a super simpleton makin ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flippin', niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I’m living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast or I'll smash on a nigga
With half the cash I’m a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'mma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I’m rubberized?
Me and N9ne master meaning we murderize
We'll bleed ‘em, beat 'em 'til they be gone feed 'em

Krizz Kaliko, Tech N9ne:
Speedom!
(If you wanna go with us)
Speedom!
(I'mma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom!
(I must be the one to bust)
Speedom!
(And I'm gonna hit the clutch)
Speedom!
(If you wanna go with us)
Speedom!
(I'mma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom!
(I must be the one to bust)
Speedom!
(And I'm gonna hit the clutch)

Krizz Kaliko:
Sometimes, I feel
Like I'll never slow down
Worldwide Choppers

Eminem:
Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstacy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat ‘em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in Vic's
But I might just swallow my fuckin' Ritalin tablet after tonight
I’m grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
Cause that’s what it’s like and attackin' it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in a backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I’d try to set a big enough fire
That’ll trigger the sprinkler system
And I’d escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being pinned to the side
Of a semi fender beside a friend of the guy’s wife Brenda
The flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I’m venomous
And I’m as slick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist, sinister
You’ve been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I’m the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity
That I’m thinkin’ about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way to make ‘em picket
I pick a day to be a prick then I’m picking the wickedest shit to say
Spit it back on a level, incredible, head full of Red Bull, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
And I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak, and coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take, like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it’s my job to say
That you’re not a real artist, but it’s my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition replenished, the Punisher
With his gun insured, hundred words
And a clip, other words motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the..

Krizz Kaliko, Tech N9ne:
Speedom!
(If you wanna go with us)

Speedom!
(If you wanna go with us)
Speedom!
(I'mma leave 'em in the dust)

Tech N9ne:
I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who’s having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Wanna get down, in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown, I'm gunning you down
We doing it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, no one'll be found, bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record, 'Lick the Balls' and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit
I'm hearing a lot of rappers, they trying to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em, and we killing 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
Cause me and my nigga Twista ruler, and that's it
