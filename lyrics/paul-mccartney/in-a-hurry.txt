(One, two, three, four)

She was always in a hurry
Never took the time to look around
She was always one to worry and fret
Staring at the ground


Every minute she'd be rushing
Someone always breathing down her neck
Felt like everyone was pushing her down
Keeping her in check

How could she leave?
She's gotta stay
Somebody has to sit and wait
Deep in a dream
She hears a voice
It's not too late to celebrate

Uncontrollable laughter
(Not too late to celebrate)
Run around in her head
(No one said you've got to wait)
This is what she was after
(Not too late to celebrate)
Not too late, not too late

It's never too late to celebrate
No one said you've gotta wait
Allow me to congratulate you, baby, yeah-yeah
It's never too late to celebrate
No one said you have to wait
Allow me to congratulate you, baby

Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late

Now she doesn't have to hurry
She can do exactly what she wants
Ask her why she doesn't worry or fret
This is her response

Uncontrollable laughter
Run around in her head
This is what she was after
Not too late, not too late

It's never too late to celebrate
No one said you've gotta wait
Allow me to congratulate you, baby, yeah-yeah
It's never too late to celebrate
Allow me to congratulate
It's never too late to celebrate you, baby

Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late

Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late

Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late

Never too late to celebrate, ah-ah
