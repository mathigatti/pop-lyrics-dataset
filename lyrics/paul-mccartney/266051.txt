When the moon lays his head on a pillow
And the stars settle down for a rest,
Just do me one small favor, I beg you,
Please play me my baby's request.


It's the song that we heard when we started.
Now the birds have all flown from our nest,
But you could bring back mem'ries departed
By playing my baby's request.

My baby said
That she knows how it goes
But you're the one who really knows,
So go ahead

Just one more time and then we'll go to bed.

But you could bring back mem'ries departed
By playing my baby's request.

My baby says
That she knows how it goes but you're the one that really knows.
So go ahead
Just one more time and then we'll go to bed.

When the moon lays his head on a pillow
And the star settles down for a rest,
Just do me one small favour, I beg you,
Please play me baby's request.
Mh-hm, play me baby's request.
Please! Play me my baby's request -- one more time.
