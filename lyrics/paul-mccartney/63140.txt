Well, well, well, well, well
do you love me like you know you ought to do?
Well, well, well, well, well
or is this the only thing you want me for?
Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about it for sometime
Sweet little lass, you are my long haired lady


Who's the lady that makes that brief occasional laughter?
She's the lady we wears those flashing eyes
Who'll be taking her home when all the dancing is over?
I'm the lucky man she will hypnotize

Long haired lady. Long haired lady

Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long
Ah, when you're wrong, love is long, love is long

Well, well, well, well, well
do you love me like you know you ought to do?
Well, well, well, well, well
or is this the only thing you want me for?
Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about it for sometime
Sweet little lass, you are my long haired lady

Bells are buzzing about my sweet delectable baby
Birds are humming about their big surprise
Who's your favorite person, dear phenomenal lady?
I belong to the girl with flashing eye

Long haired lady. Long haired lady

Ah, sing your song, love is long, love is long
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long
