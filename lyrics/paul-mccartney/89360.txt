Well the night was beautiful and mellow, mellow
And the light of the night fell on me, fell on me
You said right
Made me a happy fellow, fellow
And the light of the night fell on me
I never will forget the night
I held you close, I held you tight
Oh darling, don't you know
The way you made my senses reel?
I fell in love and now I feel
Like I will never go
Oh little darling don't you know


That the night was marvelous and yellow, yellow
And the light of the night fell on me

And the light of the night fell on me

I never will forget the way
You taught me how to swing and sway
Oh darling don't you know
That ever since that special day
My mind can only contemplate
The magic that you show
Oh little darling don't you know
That the night is beautiful and yellow, yellow
And the light of the night fell on me
Yeah the light of the night fell on me etc.
