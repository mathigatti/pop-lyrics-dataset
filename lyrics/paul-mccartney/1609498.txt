Down at Backwater junction
Rolling down the line
In the dark early morning
I heard the one-forty-nine
I was walking down the highway
Needed somewhere to go
A lady laid beside me
And she invited me home
She led me cold, tired and hungry
Down the backwater road


In a house on the corner
looking over the track
I woke up with a fever
And a pain in my back
She was lying there beside me
My fever started to grow
Had a funny feeling
But the lady said no
The lover needs a doctor
Down the Backwater Road

Whatcha' lookin' for
Whatcha' lookin' for
Lady do you know whatcha' lookin' for
Was I wrong to play along
Lady was I right or lady was I wrong

Backwater doctor
You've got me breathing in time
It's ten-thirty in the morning
And I'm feeling alright
I went back to my lady
But I wasn't to know
Lady left this morning
And she's not coming home
I was cold when she left me
Down the Backwater Road
