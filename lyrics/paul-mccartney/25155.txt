When I get older
Losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?


If I've been out
Till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

You be older too
And if you say the world
I coul stay with you

I could be handy
Mending a fuse
When your lights are gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday morning go for a ride

Doing the garden
Digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the isle of Wight
If it's not too dear
Grandchildren on our knees
Vera, Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard
Drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely wasting away

Give me your answer
Fill in a form
Mine for ever more
And you still need me
You still feed me
When I'm sixty-four
