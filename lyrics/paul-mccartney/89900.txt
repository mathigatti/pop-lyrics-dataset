And when the time comes around
We will be duty bound
To tell the through of what we've seen
And what we haven't found
Will not be going down
Despite too easy ride to see


From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice
Let me love again
Now that you turned out to be
Someone I can trust
Someone I believe

Ohh la la la
How can I walk when I can't find a way
I have a dilemma
All I want is to tell me
You're going to take it away

From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice
Let me love again
Now that you turned out to be
Someone I can trust
Someone I believe

And what we haven't found
Will not be going down
Despite too easy ride to see

From a lover to a friend
You turned out to be
Someone I believe

From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice
Let me love again

Ohh la la la
How can I walk when I can't find a way
I have a dilemma
All I want is to tell me
You're going to take it away

From a lover to a friend
From a lover to a friend
From a lover to a friend
Let me love again
