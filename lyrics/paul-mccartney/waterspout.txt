Daddy loved a dancer,
Though she never gave an answer
He used to follow her all about
Still, she couldn't shake him,
She didn't seem to make her mind up
Till he took her to the waterspout


Love comes in, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout
Whoa whoa whoa, love comes in, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout

Woody wouldn't do it,
But he said he never blew it
He didn't know what was hanging out
Oh, till he got an answer out of daddy's dancer
When she took him to the waterspout

She said, love comes in, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout
Whoa whoa whoa, love comes in, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout

Only love can get you at it and in a minute
You will find yourself swimming in it,
Only love
Catch you up today,
Take your breath away
Make you want to say what
You're thinking of, it's only love
Down at the bottom,
Down at the bottom of the waterspout
Love comes in, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout

Daddy couldn't stand it, said woody was a mad bandit
And they were knocking each other out
Whoa oh, till the little dancer came up with another answer
When she took him to the waterspout

Said, love comes in, she said, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout
Whoa whoa whoa, love comes in, yeah, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout

Only love can get you at it and in a minute
You will find yourself swimming in it, only love
Take your breath away,
Catch you up today
Make you want to say what you're thinking of,
It's only love
Down at the bottom,
Down at the bottom of the waterspout
Whoa, only love
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout
Well, love comes in, said, love comes out
Down at the bottom, down at the bottom of the waterspout
Whoa whoa whoa, love, la la la la, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout
Makes you want to do
What you're thinking of, say that only love
Oh, at the bottom, oh, at the bottom of the waterspout
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, love comes in, love comes out
