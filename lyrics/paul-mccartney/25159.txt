I will always be hoping, hoping
You will always be holding, holding
My heart in your hand
I will understand


I will understand someday, one day
You will understand always, always
From now until then

When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance
From the darkness that surrounds us

Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness
That surrounds us

And I wouldn't mind knowing, knowing
That you wouldn't mind going
Going along with my plan

When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance
From the darkness that surrounds us

Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness
That surrounds us

Hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance
I will understand
