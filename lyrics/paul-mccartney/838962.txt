We may find a trace 
Of a state of grace
In the saddest face 
Something is there


How the rivers flow
We may never know
But it goes to show
Something is there

This guiding light
Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us
All the love in the air
Let the good that surround us
Help us to always care

Then the seeds we sow
Will survive and grow
And we all will know
Something is there

This guiding light
Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us
All the love in the air
Let the good that surround us
Help us to always care

In this world where ever present dangers
Circle round our family heart
Like a throng of hostile strangers eager
for a way to start
There appears a friend's familiar face
Oh sweet relief, the heart goes to a warmer place

And this we prize
And this we hold so dear
This state of grace

We may find a trace 
Of this state of grace
In the saddest face 
Something is there

How the rivers flow
We may never know
But it goes to show
Something is there

This guiding light
Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us
All the love in the air
Let the good that surround us
Help us to always care

Life aboard this fast revolver still remains
a magic mistery
Loud reports of anger fill the pages of our history
Those of us with love can now embrace
With sweet relief a life lived at a gentler place

And this we prize
And this we hold so dear
This tumble state of grace

In the night a daffodil
Is battered by the father of all storms
daybreak sees it stand alone
Amongst a field of lifeless forms
Rays of light illuminate
Where sweet relief presents a shinig yellow face

And this we prize
And this we hold so dear
This humble state of grace

We may find a trace 
Of a state of grace
In the saddest face 
Something is there

How the rivers flow
We may never know
But it goes to show
Something is there

This guiding light
Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us
All the love in the air
Let the good that surround us
Help us to always care

Then the seeds we sow
Will survive and grow
And we all will know
Something is there

This guiding light
Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us
All the love in the air
Let the good that surround us
Help us to always care

And this we prize
And this we hold so dear
This humble state of grace
