Well when I, when I was
Just a little baby boy
Every night I would call
Your number brought me joy.


I called your house, every night since then
But I ain't never, no no never
Heard you calling me
Come on and call me back again . . . . .

Call me back again.

I've heard your name every night since then
But I ain't never, no no never . . . . .

Well when I, when I was
Just a little baby boy
Every night, every night
I would call because your number
Brought me joy

Oh -- I've called your name
Every night since then,
But I ain't never, no no no no never
Heard you calling me
Come on and call me back again.

Call me back again.
