Well I need you
Through the night
When morning comes
I love the light
But in the night-time
That dark is black
Come on baby
You got to help me get back


I love you, oh yeah
I really love you, oh yeah

Do one thing
Do one thing for me
If you've got love
Then let me see

If you feel it in your heart
Then show it right now
You know I love you baby
I gotta get to you, get to you somehow

Oh yeah, I really love you
Oh yeah, I really love you
You know it's true

I really love you
Day and night
Yeah, I really love you
In the morning light
I really love you
Sure be right
Come on little baby
Gotta find out find out somehow

Yeah, yeah, really love you
Oh yeah, really love you

I love the things
You say and do
I can't get over
How much I love you

You know you do something
Special to me
And that's the way
I want it always to be, yeah

Oh yeah, really love you
Oh yeah, I really love you

I need your love
Like a bear needs a break
I need your heart, baby
Hopping on a plate
I need the sunshine
Of your smile
Help me walk
Help me walk that extra mile

Little baby, I love you
Oh yeah, you know I really love you
Oh yeah, you know it's true
Oh yeah, I love you

I love you
