I know I was a crazy fool
For treating you the way I did
But something took hold of me
And I acted like a dustbin lid


I didn't give second though
To what the consequence might be
I really wouldn't be surprised
If you were trying to find another me

The other me would rather be the glad one
The other me would rather play the fool
I want to be the kind of me
That doesn't let you down as a rule

I know it doesn't take a lot
To have a little self-control
But every time that I forgot
Well I landed in another hole

But everytime you pull me out
I find it harder not to see
That we can build a better life
If I can try to find the other me

The other me would rather be the glad one
The other me would rather play the fool
I want to be the kind of me
That doesn't let you down as a rule

But if I ever hurt you
Well you know that it's not real
It's no easy living by yourself
So imagine how I feel

I wish that I could take it back
I'd like to make a different mood
And if you let me try again
I'll have a better attitude

Well I know that one and one make two
And that's what I want us to be
I really would appreciate it
If you'd help me find the other me

The other me would rather be the glad one
The other me would rather play the fool
I want to be the kind of me
That doesn't let you down as a rule
