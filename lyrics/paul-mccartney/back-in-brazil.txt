Back in Brazil
There lives a girl
Dreams of the future
And a far, far better world


Back in Brazil
She meets a man
He's tall and handsome
And he fits in with her plan

Bright lights ahead
Music and fun
Nights are for dancing
And the days are for the sun

All kinds of weather
Will surely come and go
But they're together
And together they will steal the show

Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban! Ban! Ban!
Ban! Ban! Ban! Ban!

Back in Brazil
She makes a date
He has to cancel
'Cause they got him working late

Back in Brazil
She feels afraid
Hope starts to crumble
And her dreams begin to fade

Her lights are out
She's gone to bed
Nights are for sleeping
If a girl's to get ahead
Even the weather
Has started changing too
But they'll be together
And together they will make it through

Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban!

So we raise a family as the clouds roll by
Making pictures of us in the sky
The kids are happy and they don't ask why
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa you and I
