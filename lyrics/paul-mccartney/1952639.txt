Please don't wake me up too late.
Tomorrow comes and I will not be late.
Late today when it becomes
Tomorrow I
Will leave and go away.


Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
My love, goodbye.

Songs that linger on my lips
Excite me now and linger on my mind.
Leave your flowers at my door;
I leave them for
The one who waits behind.

Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
My love, goodbye.

(ad lib)

Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
My love, goodbye.

Far away my lover sings
A lonely song and calls me to his side
Where the sound of lonely drums
Invited me on.
I must be by his side.

Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
My love, goodbye.

Goodbye.
Ah, ha, ha, hi.
Goodbye
