Doctor tom is getting on,
All he does is sign his name.
I get things my brainbox sings,
But I'll go down again.
Play with fire, getting higher,
Higher than a nine foot flame.
My soul is pent and so's the rent,
But I'll go down again.


Wino junko can't say no,
Wino junko, eyes aglow.
Pill freak, spring a leak, you can't say no
Till you go down again

This and treat you crazy cat,
Flying sideways once again.
I'm in a spin it makes me grin,
But I'll go down again.

Wino junko can't say no,
Wino junko, eyes aglow.
Pill freak, spring a leak, you can't say no
Till you go down again.

Till you go down again.
Till you go down again.
Till you go down.

Take what I need until I bleed,
People will say I've gone insane.
Ain't scared to die, it's such a high,
Till I go down again.

Wino junko can't say no,
Wino junko, eyes aglow.
Pill freak, spring a leak, you can't say no,
Till you go down again.

Wino junko can't say no,
Wino junko, eyes aglow.
Pill freak, spring a leak, you can't say no,
Till you go down again.

Wino junko...
