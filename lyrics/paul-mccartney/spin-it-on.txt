This is it
Spin it on,
By yourself (don't stop)
Take it back
To the top
'Cause I've got
Another lot
Of love for you
(That's why) I wanna spin it on
Spin it on


Off to the flicks
With the piddle
In her nix
To the fair with
Her hair in curlers
Her cousin couldn't get on
Down to the pleasure dome
Her cousin had to
Spend the night
In an aircraft hangar
Memories

Spin it on
Spin it on

Well off to the field
With a missionary zeal
For the life
Of the wife
Of a farmer
Her cousin couldn't
Get on down
To the village hall
Her cousin had to
Spend the night
On a pinball table
Memories
