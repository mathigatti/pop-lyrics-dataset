In time, we'll know
It's all a show
It's been a blast
As time goes by
We'll laugh and cry
It's in the past


We can start to begin
Living in the world we live

From day to day
We fight and play
The more we need
We'll soon forget
We ever met and disagreed

We can start to begin
Living in the world we live
This is it, here and now
We can find our way
Somehow

And like the dominoes
Who are falling into place
Ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones
Keep calling constantly

Imploring us to come out and play

And soon we'll see
That you and me
We're really friends
We broke the code
And walk the road that never ends

We can start to begin
Living in the world we live
This is it, here and now
We can find our way
Somehow

And like the dominoes
Who are falling into place
Ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones
Keep calling constantly

Imploring us to come out and play
Hey-hey, hey-hey

We'll take our time
And try to learn
To sing and dance
We'll hedge our bets
With no regrets
And take a chance

We can start to begin
Living in the world we live
This is it, here and now
We can find our way
Somehow

And like the dominoes
Who are falling into place
Ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones
Keep calling constantly

Imploring us to come out and play
Hey-hey, hey-hey

In time we'll know
It's all a show
It's been a blast
