You tell lies thinking I can't see,
You can't cry 'cos you're laughing at me,
I'm down (I'm really down),
I'm down (down on the ground),
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh,
When you know I'm down? (How can you laugh?)
Man buys ring woman throws it away,
Same old thing happens every day,
I'm down (I'm really down),
I'm down (down on the ground),
I'm down (IÃ‚'m really down)
How can you laugh,
When you know I'm down? (How can you laugh?)
We're all alone and there's nobody else,
You still moan Keep your hands to yourself,
I'm down (I'm really down),
I'm down (down on the ground),
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh,
When you know I'm down? (How can you laugh?)
Oh yeah
