Maybe baby I'll have you
Maybe baby you'll be true
Maybe baby I'll have you for me...
It's funny, honey, you don't care
You never listen to my prayer...
Maybe baby you will love me some day
You are the one that makes me glad
And you are the one that makes me sad
When, someday, you want me
Well, I'll be there, just wait and see
Maybe baby I'll have you
Maybe baby you'll be true
Maybe baby I'll have you for me
Yeah!
Well, you are the one that makes me glad
And you are the one that makes me sad
When, someday, you want me
I'll be there, just wait and see
Maybe baby I'll have you
Maybe baby you'll be true
Maybe baby I'll have you for me
Maybe baby I'll have you for me
