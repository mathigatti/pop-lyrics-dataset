Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I´m so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart


The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she´s mine
Because the doggone girl is mine

I don´t understand the way you think
Saying that she´s yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she´s mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don´t waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

(Paul)
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
(Michael)
But I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
(Michael &amp; Paul)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
(Michael)
But we both cannot have her
So it´s one or the other
And one day you´ll discover
That she´s my girl forever and ever

(Paul)
Don´t bulid your hopes to be let down
´Cause I really feel it´s time
(Michael)
I know she´ll tell you I´m the one for her
´Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don´t waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

She´s mine, she´s mine
No, no, no, she´s mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

(Paul)
The girl is mine, (yep) she´s mine
The girl is mine, (yes) she´s mine
(Michael)
Don´t waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

(Paul)
Michael, we´re not going to fight about this, okay
(Michael)
Paul, I think I told you, I´m a lover not a fighter
(Paul)
I´ve heard it all before Michael,she told me that I´m her forever lover, you know, don´t you remember
(Michael)
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn´t love another
(Paul)
Is that what she said
(Michael)
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming

(Paul)
I don´t believe it
(Both)
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)
(Repeat - fade out)
