Come on, baby, now
Let me look at you
Talk about yourself
Try to tell the truth
I could stay up half the night
Trying to crack your code
I could stay up half the night
But I'd rather hit the road


On the night that I met you
I was on the town
On the night that I met you

I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you
I just want it fuh you

Come on, baby, now
Help me work it out
I won't let you down
So you don't need to shout
I could stay up half the night
Playing with your head
I could stay up half the night
But I'd rather go to bed

On the night that I met you
I was on the town
On the night that I met you

I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you
I just want it fuh you

And everyday, in every way
And everyday, in every way

I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you
I just want it fuh you

I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you
