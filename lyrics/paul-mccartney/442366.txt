What's That Man Holding In His Hand?
He Looks A Lot Like A Guy I Knew Way Back When
Its Silly Willy With Philly Band
Could Be...Oo-Ee...
What's That Man Movin' Cross The Stage?
It Looks A Lot Like The One Used By Jimmy Page
Its Like A Relic From A Different Age
Could Be...Oo-Ee...


If There's Rock Show
At The Concertgebow
They're Got Long Hair
At The Madison Square
You've Got Rock And Roll
At The Hollywood Bowl,
We'll Be There...Oo Yeah...

The Lights Go Down - They're Back In Town O.K.
Behind The Stacks You Glimpse An Axe
The Tension Mounts You Score An Ounce Ole!
Temperatures Rise As You See The White Of Their Eyes

If There's Rock Show
At The Concertgebow
You're Got Long Hair
At The Madison Square
They've Got Rock And Roll
At The Hollywood Bowl,
We'll Be There...Ow Yeah...

In My Green Metal Suit I'm Preparing To Shoot Up The City
And The Ring At The End Of My Nose Makes Me Look Rather Pretty
Its A Pity There's Nobody Here To Witness The End
Save For My Dear Old Friend And Confidante - Madamoiselle Kitty

What's That Man Movin' To And Fro?
That Decibel Meter Doesn't Seem To Be Reading Low.
But They Was Louder At The Rainbow
Could Be...Oo-Ee...

If There's Rock Show
At The Concertgebow
They're Got Long Hair
At The Madison Square
You Got Rock And Roll
At The Hollywood Bowl,
We'll Be There 
Yeah...

If There's Rock Show...

If There's Rock Show...
