Scrambled eggs
Oh my baby how i love your legs
Not as much as i love scrambled eggs
Oh we should eat some scrambled eggs


Waffle fries
Oh my darling how i love your thighs
Not as much as i love waffle fries
Oh have you tried
The waffle fries

They are so damn good
That they should be illegal
They're like regular fires
But they're shaped like a waffle

Chicken wingsâ€¦
(chicken wings? no, no no. i'm vegetarian, no chicken wings)

Tofu wings
Oh my baby when hear you sing
All i think about is tofu wings
Oh did you bring the tofu wings

There's a place i know
Where i go for kick ass wings
We could even get a side of onion rings

Scrambled eggs
Oh my baby how i love your legs
Not as much as i love scrambled eggs
Oh lets go get
Some scrambled eggs

Mmmm hmmm mmm
Mmmm hmmm mmm
