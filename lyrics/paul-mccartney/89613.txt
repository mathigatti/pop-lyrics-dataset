Ears twitch, like a dog,
Breaking eggs in a dish.
Do not mock me when I say
This is not a lie.


It's funny thing, half serious,
With our hands on our ears.
Living dreams with mouths ajar,
Wide awake, we go to sleep.

However absurd, however absurd... It may seem.
However absurd, however absurd... It may seem.

Something special between us,
When we mmade love the game was over.
I couldn't say the words,
Words wouldn't get ny feelings through,
So I keep talking to you...

However absurd, however absurd... It may seem.
However absurd, however absurd... It may seem.

Custom made dinosaurs,
Too late now, for a change.
Everything is under the sun,
But nothing is for keeps...

However absurd, however absurd... It may seem.
However absurd, however absurd... It may seem.
