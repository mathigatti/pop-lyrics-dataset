This is the story of a boy named Ted
If his mother said, Ted, be good, he would


She told him tales about his soldier dad
But it made her sad, then she'd cry, oh my
Ted used to tell her he'd be twice as good
And he knew he could, because in his head

He said, mommy don't worry, now Teddy boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mommy don't worry, your teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through

Then came the day she found herself a man
Teddy turned and ran, far away, okay
He couldn't stand to see his mother in love
With another man, he didn't know, oh no
He found a place where he could settle down
And from time to time, in his head

He said, mommy don't worry, now Teddy boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mommy don't worry, your teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through

She said, Teddy don't worry, now mommy is here
Taking good care of you
Teddy don't worry, your mommy is here
Mommy's going to see you through

This is the story of a boy named Ted
If his mother said, Ted, be good, he would
