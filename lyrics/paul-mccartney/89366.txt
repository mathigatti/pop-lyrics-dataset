Well, when I met you at the station
You were standing with a bootleg in your hand
I took you back to my little place
For a taste of a multicoloured band
We're gonna get hi hi hi
The night is young
I'll put you in my pocket, little mama
Gonna rock it and we've only just begun


We're gonna get hi hi hi
With the music on
Won't say bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye
'Til the night is gone
I'm gonna do it to you, gonna do it
Sweet banana, you'll never give up
We're gettin' hi hi hi in the midday sun

Well well, take off your face
Recover from the trip you've been on
I want to lie on the bed
Get you ready for my polygon
I'm gonna do it to you, gonna do it
Sweet banana, you've never been done
Yes, I go like a rabbit, gonna grab it
Gonna do it 'til the night is done

We're gonna get hi hi hi with the music on
Won't say bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye
'Til the night is gone
I'm gonna do it to you, gonna do it
Sweet banana, you'll never give up
We're gonna get hi hi hi, we're gonna get hi hi hi
We're gonna get hi hi hi in the midday sun
