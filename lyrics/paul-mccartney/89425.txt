That Nobody Knows, No Nobody Knows

Which One Of You Can Tell Me
What Is Is I'm Looking At
Anyone Who Can
Has Got To Be A Crazy Cat
'Cause I Believe That
That Nobody Knows, No Nobody Knows
Yeah, Nobody Knows, No
Lord I Cannot Tell You
Well That's The Way I Like It
Yeah Now, Nobody Knows


Nobody Knows
Oh, Nobody Knows
Well Lord You Know That Nobody Knows

Samson And Delilah Would Have Made A Crazy Pair
If The Silly Woman Hadn't Shaven Off His Hair
I Believe That Nobody Knows, Yeah, Nobody Knows
But That's The Way I Like It
Yeah Now, Nobody Knows
That's The Way I Like It, Nobody Knows

I May Go Hungry, Maybe Next Week
Well If I Do Then I'll Still Find Something To Eat
And You Know, Nobody Knows, No Nobody Knows
Well That's The Way I Like It, Baby, Nobody Knows

And That Includes You, Honey (Nobody Knows)
I'll Pay Your Rent
I'll Do You Right (Nobody Knows)
Most Every Night
But Still There's Nobody Knows
No Now, Nobody Knows
And That's The Way I Like To Keep It
Just So Nobody Knows
