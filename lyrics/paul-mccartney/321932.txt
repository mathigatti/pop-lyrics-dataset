A certain softness, in her eyes, facinates me
More than I ever thought it would (a certain softness)
More than I ever thought it could


A certain softness in her eyes
Got me hooked
Got me hooked

A kind of sadness in her smile, captivates me
Surer than anything that's sure (a kind of sadness)
Surer than anything before

A kind of sadness in her smile
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
Got me hooked

If I can even find the words to tell
I wouldn't want to anyway
Cause that would only break the spell
And you know very well, I couldn't betray her

A touch of wildness, in her style, haunts my memory
More than I ever thought it would (a touch of wildness)
More than I ever though it could

A touch of wildness in her style
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
Got me hooked

A certain softness, in her eyes, facinates me
More than I ever thought it would (a certain softnesss)
More than I ever thought it could

A certain softness in her eyes
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
