Now, let me take you to the movies, Magg, so I can hold your hand.
Oh, it ain't that I don't like your house, it's just that doggone man
and that double barrel behind the door that waits for me, I know.
Oh, climb upon old Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show.


I only see her once a week and it's when my work is through.
I break new ground the whole week long but my mind's set straight on you.
And I polished up my old horse Beck, and she looks good, I know.
So climb upon old Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show.

Now won't you let me take you to the show so I can hold your hand.
Oh, it ain't that I don't like your house, it's just that doggone man
and that double barrel behind the door that waits for me, I know.
So climb upon old Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show.

Well, I break new ground all week long with my mind's set straight on you.
And every time I try to smile, my heart it breaks in two.
I slick myself for Saturday night cause there's one thing I know,
I'm gonna take my Maggie dear to the western picture show.
Now won't you let me take you to the show so I can hold your hand.
And it ain't that I don't like your house, it's just that doggone man
and that double barrel behind the door that waits for me, I know.
Oh, climb upon old Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show.
