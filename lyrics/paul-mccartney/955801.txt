All through the summer I have followed you around
Bringing a rose for the winter that's coming
Now the snow is on the ground
Winter rose, winter rose
Shine your light in the air
Winter rose, winter rose
Skine your light everywhere
Love awake, toll the bell
Tell the world how glad you are
Love awake to the day
When we can make our love awake


Lord knows we need it any time we can get it
But if we forget it every now and then
But if you don't feel it, later on you'll regret it
And if we let it we could set it free, you and me

Love awake, tone the bell
Tell the world how glad you are
Love awake to the day
When we can make our love awake

Snowfalls in the winter
Spring brings the rain
But it's never to long before the summer comes again.
It always comes again!
