My brave, my brave, my brave face

I've been living in style
Unaccustomed as I am
To the luxury life
I've been hitting the town
And it didn't hit back


I've been doing the rounds
Unaccustomed as I am
To the time on my hands
Now I don't have to tell anybody
When I'm going to get back

Ever since you went away
I've had this sentimental inclination
Not to change a single thing
As I pull the sheet back on the bed
I want to go bury my head
In your pillow

Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
And take me to that place
Where I can't find my brave face
Where I can't find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face
My brave face

I've been living a lie
Unaccustomed as I am
To the work of the housewife
I've been breaking up
Dirty dishes and throwing them away

Ever since you left I have been trying to
Compose a 'baby will you please come home' note
Meant for you
As I clear away another
Untouched TV dinner
From the table I laid for two

Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
And take me to that place
Where I can't find my brave face
Where I can't find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face
My brave face
