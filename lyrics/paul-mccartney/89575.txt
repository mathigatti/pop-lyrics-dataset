You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me and I see it isn't so
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know, 'cause here I go again
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you


I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see? (I love you)
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see? (I love you)
What's wrong with that?
I need to know, 'cause here I go again
I love you, I love you

Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, no, it isn't silly, love isn't silly at all

How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?

How can I tell you about my loved one?
(I love you)
How can I tell you about my loved one?
(I love you)

I love you
I love you

I love you
(I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?)
I love you
(Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me, say can't you see?)
I love you
(I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?)
I love you
(Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me, say can't you see?)
I love you
(I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?)
I love you
(Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me, say can't you see?)

You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me and I see it isn't so
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs

And what's wrong with that?
