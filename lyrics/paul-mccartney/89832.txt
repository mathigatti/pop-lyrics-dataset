Bluejean baby, with your big blue eyes
Don`t want you looking at other guys
Got to make you give me, one more chance
I can`t keep still, so baby let`s dance


Well the bluejean bop is the bop for me
It`s the bop that`s done in a dungaree
You flip your hip, free your knee
Squeel on your heel baby, one to three
Well the bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, baby won`t you bop with Gene. (Bop Blue Caps, Bop)

Well bluejean baby when I bop with you
Well my heart starts hoppin` like a kangaroo
My feet do things they never done before
Well bluejean baby, give me more more more
Well the bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, baby won`t you bop with Gene. (Rock again Blue Caps, Go)

Well the bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, baby won`t you bop with Gene.
(Blue Caps, bop with Gene, Let`s go)

Well the bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, baby won`t you bop with Gene.
