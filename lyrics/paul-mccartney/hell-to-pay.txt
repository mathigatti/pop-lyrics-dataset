First you take me to the limit then expect to stop
You know I'm sick and tired of waiting for the penny to drop
You make a living out of making people think you give it all away
But you and I know very well there's always gonna be a price to pay


But times are tough and life is hard
You've got enough and so you'll pardon me for saying
You've had it all your way
You've got know some day
You'll have to share or there'll be hell to pay

There will be hell to pay
There will be hell to pay
There will be hell to pay
There's gonna be hell to pay
