There must have been magic
The night that we met
If I hadn't stopped you
I'd always regret


A few minutes later
You'd have been out that door
And I'd have been lonely
Forever more
Forever more

Oh what made us do it?
Under what holy spell?
Nature's mother knew it
Only too well

She reached out her fingers
To point at the sky
Leaving me helpless
Not knowing why

And this is the hour
That they turn out the light
Nothing but memories
Burning so bright
Burning so bright

Oh what made us do it?
Under what holy spell?
Nature's mother knew it
Only too well

There must have been magic
The night that we met
If I hadn't stopped you
I'd always regret

There must have been magic
There must have been magic
There must have been magic
The night that we met
