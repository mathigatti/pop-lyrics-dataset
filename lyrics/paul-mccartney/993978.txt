Gratitude [3x]

I'm so grateful for everything you've ever givin' me
How can I explain what it means to be loved by you
By you, loved by you, loved by you


Show my gratitude, gratitude, show my gratitude
I wanna show my gratitude, gratitude ya.

Well, I was lonely, I was living with a memory
But my cold and lonely nights ended when you sheltered me
Loved by you, I was loved by you, ya, I was loved by you

I wanna show my gratitude, gratitude, show my gratitude to you
Gratitude, show my gratitude to you, oh ya

I should stop loving you
Think what you put me through
But I don't want to lock my heart away
I will look forward to
Days when I'd be loving you
Until then, gonna wish and hope and prey
Ya ya ya ya ya!

I wanna show my gratitude, gratitude
I wanna show my gratitude, show my
Yeah my gratitude

To be loved by you, be loved by you,
Loved by you, to be loved by you

Gratitude [3x]
