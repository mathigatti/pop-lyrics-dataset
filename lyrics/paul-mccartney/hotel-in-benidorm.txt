Well, the traffic agent told me that everything was taken care of
But here am I, got the kids got the wife, nowhere to stay tonight
Yeah, the hotel in Benindorm, still be building it
Won’t be finished soon, won’t be finished soon
Yeah, the hotel in Benindorm, still buildin’, buildin’, buildin’


We go to the beach and we go for a swim
But sooner or later yea
We’re gonna need to lay our poor burden down

The hotel in Benindorm still isn’t finished
I guess we gonna just have to hang around
