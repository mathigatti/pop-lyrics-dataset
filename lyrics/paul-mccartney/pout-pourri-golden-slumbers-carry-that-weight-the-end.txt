Once there was a way
To get back home
Once there was a way
To get back home
Sleep pretty darlin' do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby


Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles to greet you when you rise
Sleep, pretty darlin', do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way
To get back home
Once there was a way
To get back home
Sleep pretty darlin' do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Hey boy, you got to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you got to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitation
And in the middle of the celebration
I pray now

Hey boy, you got to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you got to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

oh, yeah
Alright
Are you gonna be in my dreams
Tonight?

Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

And in the end
The love we take
Is equal to the love we make
