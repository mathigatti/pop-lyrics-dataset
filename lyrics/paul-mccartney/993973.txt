If you really love me baby
Better then stayin in bed
If you really love me baby, nod your head


If you really love me baby
Til you fall down dead, she said
If you ever wanna make it, nod your head

Nod it up, nod it down
Side to side, round and round

If you ever wanna prove it
Then you hang it on a thread
If you ever wanna shake it, nod your head

If you think the life your leading
Is better then the life you lead
If you like the life your livin'
Nod your head

Well nod it up, nod it down
Side to side, round and round
Round and round

If you really love me baby
Better then stayin in bed
If you really love me baby, nod your head
