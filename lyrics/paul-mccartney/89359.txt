All stand back, let the people see
Take a snap of the famous groupies for me


Behold the famous groupies
They are alike as two peas
And where the other goes, the other goes
But though the famous groupies
Are only paid in rupees
Nobody knows what the famous groupies know
And nobody goes where the famous groupies go

There was a bongo player
Who kept an extra layer
Of Dunlopillo mattress in his van
But when the famous groupies
Arrived with their twin snoopies
Nobody saw which way the poor boy ran
Nobody does it like a famous groupie can

All stand back, let the people see
Take a snap of the famous groupies for me

There was a lead guitarist
Who lived in Epping forest
And all he ever wanted was to blow
When the girls were with him
He never lost his rhythm
And nobody knows what the famous groupies know
Nobody goes where the famous groupies go

There was a classic story
Of a roadie nicknamed Rory
Who used to practice voodoo on the side
When the famous twosome
Suggested something gruesome
All that they found was a crater two miles wide
Which left the music business absolutely horrified

All stand back, let the people see
Take a snap of the famous groupies
Famous groupies, famous groupies...
Famous groupies, famous groupies...

Ladies and gentlemen, those magnificent examples of
Female pulchritude and luminosity, direct from their
Global perambulations to the very boards of this
Supremely magnificent proscenium arch - ladies and
Gentlemen; I give you famous groupies!
