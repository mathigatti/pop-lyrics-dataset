He's just a young boy Looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy, nothing you can say will help him, Find love
He's got to do it for himself and it can take so long
He just a young boy Looking for a way to find love


He doesn't need another helping hand from someone
But don't you think he doesn't understand what he wants, Someone
Though independence means a lot he got to still be strong
He just a young boy Looking for a way to find love

Find Love, a perfect combination
Find Love, whatever you do
Find Love, a cause for celebration
Then it might come looking, come looking for you

Find love in any situation
Find Love, whatever you do
Find Love, a cause for celebration
And it might come looking, come looking for you

He's just a young boy Looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy nothing you can say will help him, Find love
He's got to do it for himself and it can take so long
He's just a young boy Looking for a way to find love

Find love, a time for meditation
Find love, a source for inspiration
Find love, instead of confrontation
And love will come looking for you
