How Many People
Stand In A Line?
How Many People
Never Get A Chance To Shine?
If You Can Tell Me
I'll Gladly Listen
How Many People Have Died?

I Want To Be Happy,
I Want To Be Free,
One Too Many Tight Now For Me

How Many People

One Too Many Tight Now For Me
I Want To See Ordinary People Living Peacefully.
How Many People

How Many People
For Goodness Sake?
How Many People?
How Many People?
One Too Many ...
