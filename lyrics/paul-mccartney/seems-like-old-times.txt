The other day I met someone I had known in another lifetime
All puzzle pieces lost without a trace fell into place in my mind
But we both knew what we were getting into


And we didn't want to stop
No we wouldn't want to miss it
Cause it seems like old times
So like long ago that I hardly even know
Who's who anymore
What's new anymore
So like long ago that it seems like old times

Familiar music man singing me a song from another lifetime
And urgent letters waiting for the post were uppermost in my mind
But he got through and then before we knew it

We didn't want to stop
No we wouldn't want to miss it
Didn't want to stop
No we wouldn't want to miss it
Cause it seems like old times
So like long ago that I hardly even know
Who's who anymore
What's new anymore
So like long ago that it seems like old times

When you reappeared and the moment I had always feared
Is upon me I felt slightly weird that's for sure
Now life is good to me though I don't see who I used to see
No it's not quite what it used to be anymore

The other day I met someone I had known in another lifetime
All puzzle pieces lost without a trace fell into place in my mind
But we both knew what we were getting into

And we didn't want to stop
No we wouldn't want to miss it
I don't want to stop
No I wouldn't want to miss it
Because it feels, yes cause it seems like old times
So like long ago that I hardly even know
Who's who anymore
What's new anymore
So like long ago that it seems like old times

Seems like old times
So like long ago that I hardly even know
Who's who anymore
What's new anymore
What's true anymore
So like long ago that it seems like old times
