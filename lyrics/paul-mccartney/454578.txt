Though some things in life are hard to bear
Don't let it bring you down
Should the sand of time run out on you
Don't let it bring you down


Don't go down, don't go underground
Things seem strange, but they change
How they change

Up and down your carousel will go
Don't let it bring you down

Don't go down, don't get out of town
Get to know how it goes, how it goes

When the price you have to pay is high
Don't let it bring you down
