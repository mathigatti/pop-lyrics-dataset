When you met me, oh oh, everything was rosy, ah ah
If you let me, oh oh, everything must surely work out fine
If you go, oh oh, everything's that's rosy turns to pieces
You know, oh oh, everything will go under, believe me


Where will i run to? where would i hide?
If you ever leave me by my side
Where will i run to? what would i do?
I really am, i really can, i really do, i really have a love for you

Now, if you get me, oh oh, that could save us all some conversation
Don't upset me, oh oh, everything is cosy here tonight
If i move, oh oh, you'd be standing by, it would make a difference
Is it true, oh oh, are you coming through, or were you just leaving?

Where will i run to? where would i hide?
If you ever leave me by my side
Where will i run to? baby, where would i hide?
I really will, i really care, i really do, i really have a love for you
Yes, i do (yes, i do)

Oh, yeah yeah yeah (oh oh, oh oh)
(oh oh, oh oh)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, babe, babe, babe, babe (oh oh, oh oh)
Oh yeah, would you ever leave me? (oh oh)

Yeah, where will i run to? where would i hide?
If you ever leave me by my side
Where will i run to? baby, baby, what will i do?
I really am, i really would, i really am, i really have a love for you
Yes, i do

When you met me, oh oh, everything was rosy
If you let me, oh oh, everything must surely work out fine
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah (oh oh)

Where will i run to? where would i hide?
If you ever leave me by my side
Where will i run to? baby, baby, what will i do?
I really am, i really can, i really do, i really have a love for you
