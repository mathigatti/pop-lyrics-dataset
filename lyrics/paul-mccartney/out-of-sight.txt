It’s out of sight, you say you love me
That this is true
The best thing to do is to lie down beside me
I said I love you
Nothing too much, just out of sight
Nothing too much, just out of sight
Nothing too much, just out of sight


I said I love, alright
I said I love you
I thought you knew
The last thing to do was to try to betray me
You want to lie
I’ll never forget it
That’s just out ought of sight
Nothing too much, just out of sight
Nothing too much, just out of sight
