Golden Earth Girl, Female Animal
Sings To The Wind, Resting At Sunset
In A Mossy Nest
Sensing Moonlight In The Air
(Moonlight In The Air)


Good Clear Water Friend Of Wilderness
Sees In The Pool Her Own Reflection.
In Another World
Someone Over There Is Counting.

Fish In A Sunbeam,
In Eggshell Seas.
Fish In A Sunbeam.
Eggshell Finish.

Natures Lover Climbs The Primrose Hill,
Smiles At The Sky Watching The Sunset
From A Mossy Nest.
As She Falls Asleep She's Counting ...

Fish In A Sunbeam,
In Eggshell Seas.
Fish In A Sunbeam.
Eggshell Finish.
