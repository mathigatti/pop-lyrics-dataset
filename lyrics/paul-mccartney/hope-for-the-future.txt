Some hope for the future
Some wait for the call
To say that the days ahead
Will be the best of all
We will build bridges up to the sky
Heavenly light surrounding you and I


Hope for the future
It's coming soon enough
How fast can we achieve?
Hope for the future
It will belong to us
If we believe
If we believe

Hope shines brightest in the dark
Where nothing's ever seen
Lighting undiscovered places no one's ever been

From out of the darkness our future will come
If we leave the past behind
We'll fly beyond the sun
And we will build bridges up to the sky
Heavenly light surrounding you and I

Hope shines brightest in the dark
Where nothing's ever seen
Lighting undiscovered places no one's ever been

Hope for the future
Hope for the future
Hope for the future
