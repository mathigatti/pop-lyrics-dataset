On the Isle of Montserrat
Though I never shall forget
Just a country boy, a guitar and a song
You invited me in
And you treated me like king
And you've given me a reason to go on


My old friend,
Thanks for inviting me in
My old friend,
May this goodbye never mean the end
If we never meet again this side of life
In a little while, over yonder,
Where it's peace and quiet
My old friend,
Won't you think about me every now and then

If I told you how I feel
Oh, it wouldn't sound so real
'Cause emotions, they are just now settin' in
But it sure is great to know
That wherever we may go
We can always be the best of friends

My old friend,
Thanks for inviting me in
My old friend,
May this goodbye never mean the end
And if we never meet again this side of life
In a little while, over yonder,
Where it's peace and quiet
My old friend,
Won't you think about me every now and then

And I'll think about you,
My old friend

Yeah...My old friend
