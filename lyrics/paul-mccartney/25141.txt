Only one more kiss
I didn't mean to hurt you little girl
Let's make it one to remember
Only one more kiss


I said a foolish thing last night
I didn't think you'd take it bad
But now I'm on my way again
And just before I go

Only one more kiss
I didn't mean to hurt you little girl
Let's make it one to remember
Only one more kiss

(guitar)

Only one more kiss
I didn't mean to hurt you little girl
Let's make it one to remember
Only one more kiss

Somebody's built a home for us
Some day we'll see it standing there
But like the wind that has to blow
I must be on my way

Only one more kiss
I didn't mean to hurt you little girl
Let's make it one to remember
Only one more kiss

Well only one more kiss
