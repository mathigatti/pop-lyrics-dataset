I can't wait another day
Until I call you
You've only got my heart on a string
And everything a-flutter


But another lonely night might take forever
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me love
'cause I know what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

May I never miss the thrill
Of being near you
And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter

I will do what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights
Never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

And I won't go away until you tell me so
No I'll never go away

Yes, I know what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights
Never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

And I won't go away until you tell me so
No I'll never go away

And I won't go away until you tell me so
No I'll never go away

No more lonely nights no more
