Our love affair was over on the second day
You packed a bag and like a birdie flew away
Meanwhile i'm sitting here, i'm getting in a mess
If you want my love, leave your name and address
I used to love you baby, when i was your man
But maybe loving you is something no one man can do
Meanwhile i'm sitting here, i'm getting in a mess
If you want my love, leave your name and address


Love to feel the tingle of your heavenly caresses
Love to intermingle, a lonely single without addresses
If you want my love, leave your name and address

But if it's all over baby, you know i'll understand
Maybe i'll hate to think of you with another man
Meanwhile i'm sitting here, i'm getting in a mess
If you want my love, leave your name and address
