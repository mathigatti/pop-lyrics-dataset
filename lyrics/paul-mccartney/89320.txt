Well, well, well, well, well,
Do you love me like you know you ought to do?
Well, well, well, well, well,
Or is this the only thing you want me for?


Well, i've been meaning to talk to you about it for some time,
Sweet little lass you are my long haired lady.

Who's the lady that makes that brief occasional laughter?
She's the lady who wears those flashing eyes.
Who'll be taking her home when all the dancing is over?
I'm the lucky man she will hypnotise.

Long haired lady,
Long haired lady.

Bees are buzzing around my sweet, delectable baby,
Birds are humming about their big surprise.
Who's your favourite person, dear phenomenal lady?
I belong to the girl with the flashing eyes.

Long haired lady,
Long haired lady.

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh.
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long.
Ah, sing your song, love is long, love is long.
Ah, when you're wrong, love is long, love is long.
Win or lose it, into the soul, love is long, love is long.
Ah, when you're wrong, love is long, love is long.

Well, well, well, well, well,
Do you love me like you know you ought to do?
Well, well, well, well, well,
Or is this the only thing you want me for?

Well, i've been meaning to talk to you about it for some time,
Sweet little lass you are my long haired lady.

Oo-uh-uh-uh

Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long.
Ah, sing your song, love is long, love is long.
Ah, when you're wrong, love is long, love is long.
Ah, when you're wrong, love is long, love is long.
Win or lose it, into the soul, love is long, love is long.
Ah, sing your song, love is long, love is long.
Win or lose it, into the soul, love is long, love is long.

Yes, love is long, love is long, love is long,
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long,
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long,

Ooh! ooh!

Yes, love is long, love is long, love is long,
Yes, sing your song, love is long, love is long.
Win or lose it, into the soul, love is long, yes, love is long.
