Take my blessings with you when you go,
I don't wanna know no more.
Head to toe, from top to bottom
I've been kicked around,
Don't wanna be kicked around no more


I'll be thinking of you when you go,
Take a walk along the shore.
Why should I pretend that nothing is the matter now?
Don't wanna be kicked around no more

My life could be so sweet,
I can't remember when I started running.
The water underneath the bridge can't keep a secret,
She's still running home.

Take my blessing with you when you go,
To the next one you adore, ooh.
Head to toe, from top to bottom
I've been kicked around,
Ain't gonna be kicked around no more

Don't wanna be kicked around,
Ain't gonna be kicked around,
Don't wanna be kicked around no more.

My life could be so sweet,
I can't remember when I started running.
The water underneath the bridge can't keep a secret,
I'm not running now.

Take my blessing with you when you go,
I don't wanna know no more.
Head to toe, from top to bottom
I've been kicked around,
Don't wanna be kicked around no more

Don't wanna be kicked around,
Ain't gonna be kicked around,
Don't wanna be kicked around no more.
