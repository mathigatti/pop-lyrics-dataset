Only One More Kiss
I Didn't Mean To Hurt You Little Girl
Let's Make It One To Remember
Only One More Kiss


I Said A Foolish Thing Last Night
I Didn't Think You'd Take It Bad
But Now I'm On My Way Again And Just Before I Go

Only One More Kiss
I Never Mean To Hurt You Little Girl
Let's Make It One To Remember
Only One More Kiss

Solo

Only One More Kiss
I Didn't Mean To Hurt You Little Girl
Let's Make It One To Remember
Only One More Kiss

Somebody's Built A Home For Us
Someday We'll See It Standing There
But Like The Wind That Has To Blow
I Must Be On My Way

Only One More Kiss
I Never Mean To Hurt You Little Girl
Let's Make It One To Remember
Only One More Kiss
Well Only One More Kiss
