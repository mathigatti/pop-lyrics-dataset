I long to know 
All your secrets
I want to walk 
Through your fire
Light up my eyes 
With your smile
I was awakened 
By magic


I was alone 
In this world
Take me away from here
Life spinning round 
At a blistering pace
I've been shot 
From a gun
To your final embrace
My soul, your heart
Two worlds
Apart

This life 
Is all we have
How could this steal 
All these feelings
How could they lie 
To this world
A picture away 
From your smile

Life spinning round 
At a blistering pace
I've been shot 
From a gun
To your final embrace
My soul, your heart
Two worlds
Apart

This life 
Is all we have
One soul displaced
One heart replaced
Feelings defaced
Invade our space
No one left 
To give us 
Back our time

We could climb 
Every mountain
Swim to every sea
When the all world 
Is asleep
We can set 
Ourselves free
My soul, your heart
Two worlds
Apart

This life 
Is all we have
Mmm 
Yeah, yeah
We could climb 
Every mountain
Swim to every sea

When all the world 
Is asleep
We can set 
Ourselves free
We could climb 
Every mountain
Swim to every sea

When all the world 
Is asleep
We can set 
Ourselves free
My soul, your heart
Two worlds
Apart this life
Ooooh
