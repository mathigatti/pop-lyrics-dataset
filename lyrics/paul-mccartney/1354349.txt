The mood is right, the spirit's up
We're here tonight and that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time


The party's on, the feeling's here
That only comes this time of year
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

Love choir of children sing their song

Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding
Oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, doo

We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

Love choir of children sing their song
They've practiced all year long

Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong

The party's on, the spirit's up
We're here tonight and that's enough
Oo-oo, simply having a wonderful Christmastime
We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time

Oh
Oh yeah

(A wonderful Christmastime)
(oo-oo-oo)

The mood is right, the spirit's up
We're here tonight and that's enough
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
For Christmastime, Christmastime
