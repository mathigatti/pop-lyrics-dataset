Any time, any day
You can hear the people say
That love is blind, well, I don't know
But I say love is kind
Soldier boy kisses girl
Leaves behind a tragic world
But he wont mind, he's in love
And he says love is fine


Oh, yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said

He said

Oh, yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said

Oh, yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said

The wonder of it all, baby
The wonder of it all, baby
The wonder of it all, baby
