Some People say she's a bad girl
Some people think she's a fool
Some people tell me she's no good
But I'm telling you
It's not true, it's not true, it's not true


They say that my girl's a mad girl
No saying what she might do
Some people tell me she's crazy.
But I'm telling you
It's not true, it's not true, it's not true

Ooh...Ooh...Ooh...They've been talking to the fella's
Ooh...Ooh...Ooh...Have they never heard of jealousy?
Ooh...Ooh...Ooh...If she helps me write the melody
I'll let the words take care of themselves.

It's not true, it's not true, it's not true
It's not true, it's not true, it's not true

Ooh...Ooh...Ooh...They've been talking to the fella's
Ooh...Ooh...Ooh...Have they never heard of jealousy?
Ooh...Ooh...Ooh...If she helps me write the memories
I'll let the words take care of themselves.

Some people say she's a loser
Some people tell me that she's through
Some people say I don't love her
But I'm telling you
It's not true, it's not true, it's not true
What they're saying about her isn't true

Don't you know it isn't true?

It's not true....
