You look a little lonely,
Maybe I could meet you,
Tell me where to reach you,
And I'll give you a ring.
I'll take you to the pictures,
I'll miss the second feature.
Lord, I can't believe my eyes, I must be dreaming,
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring.


You look a little hungry,
Maybe I could take you,
Tell when to wake you up
And I'll give you a ring.
I take you to the restaurant,
We're looking at the menu.
Lord, I can't believe my eyes, I must be dreaming,
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring.

Oh man, I know I won't be lonely any more, (won't be lonely any more)
Me and my phone, I'm gonna call your home.
I won't be lonely any more. (won't be lonely any more)

Lord, I can't believe my eyes, I must be dreaming,
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring,

Oh, man, I know I won't be lonely any more, (won't be lonely any more)
Me and my phone, I'm gonna call your home.
I won't be lonely any more, (won't be lonely any more)

You look a little sleepy,
Wanna go to bed, dear?
Tell me can wed, dear,
I'll give you a ring
Take you to the chapel,
Listen to the sermon.
Lord, I can't believe my ears, I must be dreaming,
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring,
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring,
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring.
