I can try to give you everything you ever wanted
You're not hard to please
And the only thing I'm asking is return, is something
You can give with easy


Keep on sending your love
In the heat of battle
You've got something that'll save us
Save us now

I've got the feeling of a jungle rhythm beating in me
When I'm close to you
I don't really want to ask for many favours
But there's something you can do

Keep on sending your love
In the heat of battle
You've got something that'll save us
Save us now

Ohhhhhh
You're my woman
Ohhhhhh
Keep it coming
Ohhhhhh
You got something that can save us, save us

Keep on sending your love
In the heat of battle
You've got something that'll save us

Save us now
Save us now
