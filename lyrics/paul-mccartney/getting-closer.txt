Say you don't love him, my salamander
Why do you need him?
Oh no, don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart


Keeping ahead of the rain on the road
Watching my windscreen wipers
Radio play me a danceable ode
Cattle beware of snipers

When will you see me, my salamander?
Now don't try to tell me
Oh no, don't answer, oh no

L'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart

Hitting the chisel and making a joint
Glueing my fingers together
Radio play me a song with a point
Sailor beware of weather

L'm getting closer, my salamander
Well when will we be there?
Ah no, don't answer, oh no

L'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart
I'm getting closer to your heart
