To lead a better life, I need a love of my own
Here,
Making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to meet her everywhere,
Knowing that love is to share,
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I will be here, there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
