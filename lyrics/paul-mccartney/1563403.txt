Seven thirty seven comin' out of the sky
Won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride
I wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band
Yeh!
Well I'm flyin' 'cross the land tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band


Take me to the hotel baggage gone oh well
Come on come on won't you get me to my room
I wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band
Yeh!
Well I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band

Listen to the radio talkin' 'bout the last show
Someone got excited, had to call the state militia
Wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band
Yeh!
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band

Here we come again on a Saturday night
With your fussin' and your fightin' won't you get me to the rhyme
I wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band
Yeh!
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band

Playin' in a travelin' band
Playin' in a travelin' band
Won't you give myself a hand
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band, Ooooooooowww!

Yes I do, thank you very much!
