Windstorm,
comes the sound,
from the stars
my dark has come.
I're gone from me.
Oh oh! tragedy
Oh come back,
help me here
me a call my love,
be sincere (a)
I're gone from me, oh oh
Tragedy
Like smoke
from a fire of love ... oh oh
All our dreams
have gone to a fire ... oh oh
Blow the wind,
kiss by the snow
all that is left is the dark.
We know that
you're gone from me ... oh oh
Tragedy
As smoke
from a fire of love ... oh oh
all our dreams
have gone to a fire ... oh oh
The wind blows
kissed by the snow
all that is left is the dark
We know that
you're gone from me ... oh oh
Tragedy
