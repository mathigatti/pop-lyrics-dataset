I'm, I'm
Flying to my home
Home
Flying to my home
Home, home, home


The sun is fading in the west
Out where the cattle roam
I'm like a bird at the end of the day
Flying to my home
I'm flying to my home, sweet majesty
I'm flying to my home

Uh

The sky is like a painted flag
Above a sea of chrome
I've got a woman living in my life
Living in my home
I'm flying to my home, sweet majesty
I'm flying to my home

I haven't been back for so long
I don't know if I'm gonna recognise it
Uh, uh, uh, uh
They gave the old place a new face
And I'm gonna take some time to size the situation up

Ah
Ah, ah
Uh
Uh
Uh, uh
Uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh

I haven't been back for so long
I don't know if I'm gonna recognise it
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
They gave the old place a new face
And I'm gonna take some time to size the situation up, oh, yeah

The sun is fading in the west
Out where the cattle roam
I've got a woman living in my life
Living in my home
Ooh, I'm flying to my home, sweet majesty
I'm flying to my home

I'm flying to my home, (I'm flying to my home)
I'm flying to my home, (I'm flying to my home)
I'm flying to my home, (I'm flying to my home)
Flying to my home, sweet majesty
I'm flying to my home

I'm flying to my home
I'm flying to my home
Flying to my home
I'm flying to my home
I'm flying to my home
Flying to my home
Flying
