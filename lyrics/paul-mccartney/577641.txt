There's only one thing that money can't buy
True love, that will never die, oh no, no


All my trials, Lord, soon be over

If religion was a thing that money could buy
Well the rich would live, and the poor would die, wo-oh

All my trials, Lord, soon be over

Ah
Ah

The river of Jordan is chilly and cold, yeah-hey-yeah
Chills the body, but not the soul, yeah, oh

All my trials, Lord, soon be over
All my trials, Lord, soon be over
All my trials, Lord, soon be over
