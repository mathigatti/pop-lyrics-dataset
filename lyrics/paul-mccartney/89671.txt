Going Fast, Coming Soon
We Made Love In The Afternoon.
Found A Flat, After That
We Got Married.
Working Hard For The Dream,
Scoring Goals For The Other Team,
Times Were Bad, We Were Glad
We Got Married.
Like The Way You Open Up Your Hearts To Each Other,
When You Find A Meeting Of The Minds.
Just As Well Love Was All We Ever Wanted,
It Was All We Ever Had.
Further On In The Game,
Waiting Up Till The Children Came.
Place Your Bets, No Regrets,
We Got Married.
We Got Married.
We Got Married.
Nowadays Every Night Flashes By
At The Speed Of Light,
Living Life, Loving Wife,
We Got Married.
I Love The Things That Happen
When We Start To Discover
Who We Are
And What We're Living For,
Just Because Love Was
All We Ever Wanted
It Was All We Ever Had.
It's Not Just A Loving Machine,
It Doesn't Work Out
If You Don't Work At It.
