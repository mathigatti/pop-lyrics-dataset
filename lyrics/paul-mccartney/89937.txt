Here we are
Back in the sunshine again
No more worries
and no more pain


We're leaving behind
All our troubles and strife
And that's the way it's gonna be
For the rest of my life

Here we are, here we are
Back in the sunshine again
No more worries, no more worries
And no more pain, no more pain

Life's too short, to spend it lonely
You only throw it away
Listen to your voice of reason, call it a day

Take a ride, take a ride
Out to the land of the free
Don't hurry take your time, take your time
Come and spend it with me

Back in the sunshine
Back in the sunshine

Here we are
Back in the sunshine again
No more worries, no more worries
And no more pain

Life's too short, to spend it lonely
You only throw it away
Listen to your voice of reason, call it a day

Here we are
Back in the sunshine again
No more worries, no more worries
And no more pain

Here we are
Back in the sunshine again
No more worries or pain
And no more pain

Back in the sunshine again
No more worries
Back in the sunshine again
