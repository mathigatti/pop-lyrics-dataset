Somebody told me to walk away
When love got hard and i had to play
But you know it’s such a shame
Nobody knows how to play
This loving game


Sometimes we all seem to act like fools
But do we care who breaks the rules?
I suppose it’s all the same
We never learn how to play
This loving game

Do i love you after so much
As i did before?
Darling i could hardly love you more

I tried to look for some good advice
Cos we all have to pay the price
But till now, you never came
I’ll never know how to play
This loving game

Do i love you after s-much
As i used to do?
No one knows me half as well as you
Yeah, you know you do, you know you

Somebody told me to walk away
When love got hard and i had to play
But you know that it’s still a shame
Nobody knows how to play
This loving game

Nobody knows how to play
This loving game
