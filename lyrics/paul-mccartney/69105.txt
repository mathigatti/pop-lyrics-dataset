Picking up scales and broken chords
Puppy dog tails in the House of Lords
Tell me darling
What can it mean?


Making up moons in a minor key
What have those tunes got to do with me?
Tell me darling
Where have you been?

Once upon a long ago
Children searched for treasure
Nature's plan went hand in hand
With pleasure
Such pleasure

Blowing balloons on a windy day
Desolate dunes with a lot to say
Tell me darling
What have you seen?

Once upon a long ago
Children searched for treasure
Nature's plan went hand in hand
With pleasure
My pleasure

Playing guitars on an empty stage
Counting the bars of an iron cage
Tell me darling
What can it mean?

Picking up scales and broken chords
Puppy dog tails in the House of Lords
Help me darling
What does it mean?

Once upon a long ago
