You can make my life complete
If you say that we could meet
For a minute on the sixty second street


The cities melting in the heat
Iâ€™ve got my flip-flops on my feet
You see me walking down
Sixty second street

Well time is flying by so fast
Each day quicker than the last
It means I must be having fun
I hope it carries on and on and on

Sixty seconds of your day
Is all I ask of you
I only need a little time
To show what I can do, do doodle
Do do

We can grab a bite to eat
Sit and listen to the beat
Of the traffic on
Sixty second street

Well time is flying by so fast
Each day quicker than the last
It means I must be having fun
I hope it carries on and on and on

Sixty seconds of your day
Is all I ask of you
I only need a little time
To show what I can do, do doodle
Do, do

You can make my life complete
If you say that we could meet
For a minute on
Sixty second street
Just a minute on
Sixty second street

Just a minute on
Sixty second street
Sixty second street
