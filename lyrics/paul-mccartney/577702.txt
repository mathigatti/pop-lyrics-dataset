I know something you don't know
I want you to listen to the tale.
I know a reasonable woman
Handsome and witty, yet a friend.
She's got the right amount of passion
She isn't into rumour
Not too serious or too dumb
And equal mixture of good humour
And sweet, sweet memories, (ah, sweet memories)
Sweet, sweet memories,
Sweet memories,
Sweet, sweet, memories,
She's got sweet, sweet memories,
Sweet memories,
Sweet, sweet memories.


Has she got any faults then?
Yes, she has one i must admit
When all the world tries to praise her
She refuses to hear it
She's got the right amount of passion
She isn't into rumour
Not too serious or too dumb
And equal mixture of good humour
And sweet, sweet memories,
Sweet, sweet memories,
Yeah, we got sweet, sweet memories,
Sweet, memories,
Sweet, sweet memories,
She's got sweet, sweet memories,
Yeah, sweet memories.
Sweet, sweet memories.
Woooh - heh, heh

She's got the right amount of passion
She isn't into rumour
Not too serious or too dumb
And equal mixture of good humour
And sweet, sweet memories,
?
Sweet, sweet memories,
Sweet memories
Sweet, sweet memories,
She's got sweet, sweet memories,
Sweet memories,
Sweet, sweet memories,

Oh, memory, memories
?
Hey yeah, sweet memories
We got sweet, sweet memories,
Taking me back,
Taking me back
