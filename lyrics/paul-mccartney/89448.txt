When Your Body Is Coming Apart At The Seams
And The Whole Thing's Feeling Low You're Convincing Yourself
That There's Nobody There, I Know
I Know Now You Feel


Like Somebody Has Taken The Wheels Off Your Car
When You Had Somewhere To Go Well It's Annoying
Not Going To Get Very Far I Know
But Somebody Cares

There's Always Someone, Somewhere, You Should Know By Now
Always Somebody Who Cares It's Happening Day In, Day Out
Well You Know By Now Always Somebody Who Cares

If You Don't Know It How Will It Find You?
How Will We Know Your Whereabouts?
But I Know How You Feel

I Know How You Feel

Like Somebody Has Taken The Wheels Off Your Car
When You Had Somewhere To Go Well It's Frustrating
Not Going To Get Very Far I Know
But Somebody Cares

There's Always Someone, Somewhere, You Should Know By Now
Always Somebody Who Cares It's Happening Day In, Day Out
Well You Know By Now Always Somebody Who Cares

If You Don't Know It How Will It Find You?
How Will We Know Your Whereabouts?
But I Know How You Feel
