I've waited all my life for you
Hold me tight
Take care of me and I'll be right


Hold me tight, hold me tight
Hold me tight, hugga me right
Hold me tight, squeeza me tight
Hold me tight, hugga me right
Hold me tight, Hold me tight, Hold me tight

You won't be going out tonight
Candlelight
Make love to me and make it right

Hold me tight, Hold me tight
Hold me tight, Hugga me right
Hold me tight, Hold me tight
Hugga me right, Hold me tight,
Hold me tight, Hold me tight

Well, hold me tight, Hold me tight
Hold me tight, Hugga me right
Hold me tight, Squeeza me tight
Hold me tight, Hugga me right
Hold me tight, Hold me tight
