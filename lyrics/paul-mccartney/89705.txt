Don't let the sun catch you cryin',
Cryin' on my front door,
You done daddy dirty now
And honey he ain't gonna love you no more.


And don't let the sun catch you cryin',
Cryin' on my front door,
You done daddy dirty now
And honey he ain't gonna love you no more.

Well you can cry, cry, cry, cry
Oh now baby, you can wail.
Yo can bang your little head on the pavement
Till the man comes and throws you in jail.

Cryin' on my front door,
You done daddy dirty now
Yeah and honey he ain't gonna love you no more.

Well you can cry, cry, cry, cry
Oh now baby, baby you can wail.
You can bang your hear on that hard hard pavement
Till the man comes and throws you in jail.

Cryin' on my front door,
You done daddy dirty now
And honey he ain't gonna love you no more.

Yeah, you know you done him dirty now,
you know you done him dirty,
and I just can't love you no more.
