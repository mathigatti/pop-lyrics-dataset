Ooh, baby, you couldn't have done a worse thing to me
If you'da taken an arrow and run it right through me. ooh.
Ooh baby, a bird in the hand is worth two flyin'
But when it came to love, I'd knew you'd be lyin'.


It could have been a finer thing,
Would have been a major attraction
With no other thing: offering a note of distraction.
come on, get up, get under way, bring your love.

Ooh baby, you wouldn't have found a motown hero
If you'da started at nothing and counted to zero.

Ooh baby, you couldn't have done a worse thing to me
If you'da taken an arrow and run it right through me.

It could have been a finer thing
Would have been amajor attraction
If no other thing than offering a no love distraction
Come on, get up, get under way, bring your love.

Ooh baby, you wouldn't have found a motown hero
If you'da started at nothing and counted the zero.
