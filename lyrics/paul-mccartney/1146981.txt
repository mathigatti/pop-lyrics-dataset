Since she's been gone
I want no one
to talk to me
It's not the same
but I'm to blame
It's plain to see


So go away and leave me alone
Don't bother me

I can't believe
that she would leave
me on my own
It's just not right
where every night
I'm all alone

I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But till she's here
please don't come near
just stay away
I'll let you know
when she's come home
Till that the day

Don't come around leave me alone
Don't bother me

I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But till she's here
please don't come near
just stay away
I'll let you know
when she's come home
Till that the day

Don't come around leave me alone
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
