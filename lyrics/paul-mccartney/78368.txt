Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh, Lord, why don't we?


We all know that people are the same wherever we go
There is good and bad in everyone

We learn to live
We learn to give each other what we need to survive
Together alive

Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh, Lord, why don't we?

Ebony, ivory, living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory

We all know that people are the same wherever we go
There is good and bad in everyone

We learn to live
We learn to give each other what we need to survive
Together alive

Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh, Lord, why don't we?

Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh, Lord, why don't we?

Ebony, ivory, living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory, living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory, living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory, living in perfect harmony
