We had the greatest time
At Frank Sinatra's party
We drank expensive wine
Then watched the night roll by


I saw a showgirl dance
With Sammy Davis Jr
They had a brief romance
Under the desert sky

Fee, fi, fo, fum
I’m not the only Englishman
I'm under cover but plenty of others
Are already flying high

See Angie Dickinson
Bump into Peter Lawford
She's out to have some fun
He doesn’t seem to mind

You don't have to doubt yourself
No, not on a night like this

Jump in the swimming pool
Say hi to Dino Martin
He's hot to play it cool
Watching the girls go by

Fee, fi, fo, fum
I'm not the only Englishman
I'm under cover
But some of my brothers
Are already flying high

Come and enjoy yourself
At Frank Sinatra's party
We had the greatest time
Watching the night go by
