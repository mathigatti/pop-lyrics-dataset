In a village in old siam, sir
Lived a lady who lost her way
In an effort to find her man, sir
She found herself in old U.K


She waited round in walthamstow
She scouted round in scarborough
She waited round in walthamstow
She skated round in scarborough

In a village in old eastham, sir
She met a fellow who made her reel
Took her rushes to show his mam, sir
Met his dad at the wedding meal

In a letter from old siam, sir
Came a terrible tale of woe
She decided the only answer
Was to get up a pile of dough

She waited round in walthamstow
She scouted round in scarborough
Waited round in walthamstow
She scouted round in scarborough

When a relative to her man, sir
He directed her not to stay
In a village in old siam, sir
Lived a lady who lost her way

Oh!
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!

In a village in old siam, sir
Lived a lady who lost her way
In an effort to find her man, sir
Found herself in old U.K

Waited round in walthamstow
Scouted round in scarborough
Waited round in walthamstow
Scouted round in scarborough

In a village in old siam, sir
Lived a lady who lost her way
In an effort to find her man, sir
Found herself in old U.K

Walthamstow
Scarborough
