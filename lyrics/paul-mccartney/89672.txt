Give me your hand I'd like to shake it
I want to show you I'm your friend,
You'll understand if I can make it clear
It's all that matters in the end.


Put it there if it weighs a ton,
That's what a father said to his young son
I don't care if it weighs a ton,
As long as you and I are here, put it there.
Long as you and I are here, put it there.

If there's a fight I'd like to fix it,
I hate to see things go so wrong.
The darkest night and all it's mixed emotions
Is getting lighter sing along.

Put it there if it weighs a ton,
That's what a father said to his young son
I don't care if it weighs a ton,
As long as you and I are here, put it there.
Long as you and I are here, put it there.
