You wanna give your love away,
And end up giving nothing.
I'm not surprised
That your black eyes are gazing.


You say that love is ev'rything
And what we need the most of.
I wish you knew,
That's just how true my love was.

No words for my love.

Your burning love,
Sweet, burning love,
It's deep inside.
You mustn't hide your burning love,
Sweet, burning love,
Your burning love.

I wanna turn your head away,
And someone's thinking of you.
I wish you'd see,
It's only me, i love you.

No words for my love.
