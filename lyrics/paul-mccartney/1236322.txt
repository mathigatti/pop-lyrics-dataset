Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
that you can see
Woh, these chains of love
got a hold on me, yeah


Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around
'cause I'm not free
Woh, these chains of love
Won't let me be, yeah

I wanna tell you pretty baby
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you
But, darling, I'm imprisoned by these

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
that you can see
Woh, these chains of love
got a hold on me, yeah

Please believe me when I tell you
your lips are sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But, I can't break away from all these

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
that you can see
Woh, these chains of love
got a hold on me, yeah

Chains, chains of love
Chains of love, chains of love
