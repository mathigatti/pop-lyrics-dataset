Big boys bickering,
That's what they're doin' ev'ryday.
Big boys bickering,
Fuckin' it up for ev'ryone, ev'ryone.


Guess while they're betting on the track,
They're tryin' to win your money back.
All of the taxes that you paid,
Went to fund the masquerade.

Big boys bickering,
That's what they're doin' all the day.
Big boys bickering,
Fuckin' it up in ev'ry way, ev'ry way.

We stand here waiting
Underneath the tower block.
Who will win and who will lose?
Which way do the big boys choose?
Which of us will never know what goes on?

Oo -

Who will win, who will lose?

So while they argue through the night,
Shakin' their sticks of dynamite,
Babies are dying through the day,
They wanna blow us all away.

Big boys bickering,
And so the game goes on and on.
Big boys bickering,
Fucking it up for ev'ryone, ev'ryone,
For ev'ryone, for ev'ryone, for ev'ryone,
For ev'ryone, ev'ryone.

Fucking it up for ev'ryone,
(fuckin' it up for ev'ryone)
Fucking it up for ev'ryone,
Ev'ryone, ev'ryone,
Ev'ry, ev'ry, ev'ry, ev'ry, ev'ryone.
