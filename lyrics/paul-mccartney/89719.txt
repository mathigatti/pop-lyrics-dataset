BOY SOLO

Non nobis solum
Sed toti mundo nati,
Toti mundo nati.


BOYS' CHOIR
Non nobis solum
Sed toti mundo nati.

CHORUS
(Ah), Ah

SHANTY
The air raid siren slices through
A night in 1942.
A couple sheltering in the gloom
Know all too well this waiting room
For often they have in the past
Been huddled close against the blast
Of doodle bugs and bombs galore,
They can't put up with any more.
So it was that I was born
Into this world one summer morning
And breaking through this brand new day
I hear the sound of warning.

CHORUS
(War, Ah)

SHANTY
Oh will it all end here?
Or is their future round the corner?
You'll be forgiven if you're down on your knees.
What will it be what will it?
What will we be what will we?
What will we see what will we see?

They stay in darkness underground
Until they hear the All Clear sound
And weary eyes will search the sky
For any sign of sunlight.
For any sign of sunlight.

CHORUS
Mother and father holding their child,
Not knowing what future magic lies inside.
We open our hearts,
You open the door
To peace and happiness for evermore,
For us for evermore.
