Oh you got your whole life laid down in front of you
When you've gotta decide exactly what you wanna do
Look to it rising and listen to it calling you
Yeah you got your whole life laid down in front of you


Ohhhhhh

I need to know
You need to tell me
I need to find out right now
I need to hear it from (?)
I need you to tell me its mistery right now


Ohhhhhh

Oh yeah you got your whole life laid down in front of you

From the mountais till the ocean listen to it calling you
You gotta decide exactly what you wanna do
Yeah you got your whole life laid down in front of you

I need to know
You need to tell me
I need to find out right now
I need to hear it from (?)
I need you to tell me its mistery right now


Tell me...

Oh yeah you got your whole life laid down in front of you (2x)

You got the power to do what you need to do

I need to know
You need to tell me
I need to find out right now
I need to hear it from (?)
I need you to tell me its mistery right now
Solo - I need to know...gimme what I need

Fade to abe's frantic drumming...the end
