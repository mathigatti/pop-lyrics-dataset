For me to say what i'm about to say
Could take a bit of courage.
But i can summon up enough of this and maybe more.


Without your love i know i'd find it difficult,
No reason to continue,
So how can anyone live not knowing what love is.

I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before,
I don't wanna think about it anyhow.
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before,
We don't have to talk about it, (talk about it) no, not now.

Need a lie, when i don't have to lie,
It get me into trouble
And i've been keepin' out of trouble for a long time now. (long time, long time)

So this is true, it's me for you eternity,
Can go and last forever.
But while we're taking our time,
I pity those that love left behind, oo -

I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before,
I don't wanna think about it (think about it) anyhow, anyhow. (oh)
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before,
We don't have to talk about it, (talk about it) oh, not now.

Oh - oh-oh-oh-oh.

Talk about it now.

I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before,
I don't wanna think about it, think about it anyhow. (oh)
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before,
(like this before)
I don't have to talk about it, (talk about it) no, not now.

I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before,
I don't wanna think about it, (i can't imagine) think about it anyhow.
(i can't imagine how it felt before)
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before, (oh)
We don't have to talk about it, (talk about it)
No, not now. (don't wanna talk about it any more)
I don't wanna talk about it, (talk about it) no, not now.
