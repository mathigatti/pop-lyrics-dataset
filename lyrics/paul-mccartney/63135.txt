Maybe, I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Maybe, I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
And hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you


Maybe I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?

Maybe I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?

Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
You right me when I'm wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you
