Don't look at me
It's way too soon to see
What's gonna be
Don't look at me
All my life
I never knew what I could be
What I could do
Then we were new


You came along
And made my life a song
One lucky day
You came along
Just in time
When I was searching for a rhyme
You came along
Then we were new

We can do what we want
We can live as we choose
You see there is no guarantee
We've got nothing to lose

Don't look at me
I can't deny the truth
It's plain to see
Don't look at me
All my life
I never knew what I could be
What I could do
Then we were new

We can do what we want
We can live as we choose
You see there is no guarantee
We've got nothing to lose

Don't look at me
It's way too soon to see
What's gonna be
Don't look at me
All my life
I never knew what I could be
What I could do

Then we were new
Then we were new
Now we are new
