In spite of all the danger,
in spite of all that may be
I'll do anything for you,
anything you want me to,
if you'll be true to me.


In spite of all the heartache,
that you may cause me,
I'll do anything for you,
anything you want me to,
if you'll be true to me.

I'll look after you
like I've never done before.
I'll keep all the others
from knocking at your door.

In spite of all the danger,
in spite of all that may be,
I'll do anything for you,
anything you want me to,
if you'll be true to me.

In spite of all the heartache
that you may cause me,
I'll do anything for you,
anything you want me to,
if you'll be true to me.
I'll do anything for you,
anything you want me to,
if you'll be true to me.
