Someone's got a home tonight
Someone's got a road tonight
Someone's got a wad, action will be red
You you wanna worry?
Oo, you're gonna knock 'em dead
Someone's got a show tonight
Someone's gotta go tonight
Someone's doing rhyme, someone turn your mind
Someone to lift your eyes up
Leanin' toward the light


So glad to see you here, so glad you could come (yeah!)
So glad to see you here
Carry on, carry on

Yeah, yeah!
Oh, we're going up tonight
Well in time to make a flight
The airplane's standing on the runway
Engine nervously waiting for something to bite

Got to roll tonight
You got to roll tonight
Some have got it bad, some have got to do it
You got it better, and there's nothing to it
No no no no

So glad to see you here, so glad you could come, yeah!
So glad to see you here
Carry on, carry on!
