If you ask her how it's done, she wont't know
It's like trying to catch the sun on the water
She tries to explain, then it happens again


Everybody's looking at her
She's got everybody talking about her
She's good, she's kind, she's so refined

But me, I'm losing my mind

Though she haunts me like the sound of the rain
Or a river running down to the ocean
I hate to complain, but it's happening again

Everybody's looking at her
She's got everybody talking about her
She's good, so fine, she's sweet as wine

But me, I'm losing my mind
Doesn't she know, why can't she see
Look at the effect that she's having on me
I'm not alone, I'm part of the crowd
Turning our heads as she walks down the street

She tries to explain, then it happens again

Everybody's looking at her
She's got everybody talking about her
She's good, she's kind, she's so refined

But me, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
