We're So Sorry Uncle Albert 
We're So Sorry If We Caused You Any Pain 
We're So Sorry Uncle Albert 
But There's No One Left At Home 
And I Believe I'm Gonna Rain 


We're So Sorry But We Haven't Heard A Thing All Day 
We're So Sorry Uncle Albert 
But If Anything Should Happen We'll Be Sure To Give A Ring 

We're So Sorry Uncle Albert 
But We Haven't Done A Bloody Thing All Day 
We're So Sorry Uncle Albert 
But The Kettle's On The Boil And We're So Easily Called Away

Admiral Halsey Notified Me 
He Had To Have A Berth Or He Couldn't Get To Sea 
I Had Another Look And I Had A Cup Of Tea And Butter Pie 

(The Butter Wouldn't Melt So I Put It In The Pie)

Live A Little Be A Gypsy, Get Around(Get Around) 
Get Your Feet Up Off The Ground

Live A Little Be A Gypsy, Get Around(Get Around) 
Get Your Feet Up Off The Ground
