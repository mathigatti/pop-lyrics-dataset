Did I ever take you in my arms
Look you in the eye, tell you that I do
Did I ever open up my heart
Let you look inside


If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one

The swan is gliding above the ocean
A God is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black

Did I ever touch you on the cheek
Say that you were mine, thank you for the smile
Did I ever knock upon your door
And try to get inside?

If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one

The swan is gliding above the ocean
A God is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this swan to black

What opportunities did we allow to flow by
Feeling like the time it wasn't quite right?
What kind of magic might have worked if we had stayed calm
Couldn't I have given you a better life?

Did you ever take me in your arms
Look me in the eye tell me that you do?
Did I ever open up my heart
Let you look inside?

If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one

The swan is gliding above the ocean
A God is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this swan to black

The swan is gliding, oooh
A God is riding, oooh
Calm the water (how calm the water)
Bright the rainbow
