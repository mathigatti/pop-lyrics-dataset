Well, I never felt more like singing the blues
And I never thought
that I'd ever lose your love
Why did you do me this way?
Well, I never felt more like crying all night
Everything's wrong
But nothing is right without you
You've got me singing the blues
Well, the moon and the stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do
But cry-i-i-i over you
Cry over you
Well, I never felt more like running away
And why shouldn't I go
'Cause I couldn't stay without you
You've got me singing the blues.
Well, the moon and the stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do
But cry-i-i-i over you
Cry over you
Well, I never felt more like running away
And why shouldn't I go
'Cause I couldn't stay without you
You've got me singing the blues
(Mr. Paul Wiggins, Come on Paul)
Well, the moon and the stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do
But cry-i-i-i over you
Cry over you
Well, I never felt more like running away
And why shouldn't I go
'Cause I couldn't stay without you
You've got me singing the blues
You've got me singing the blues
You've got me singing the blues, ooh
