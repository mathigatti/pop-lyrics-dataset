Tell me why, why, why do you treat me so bad, so bad
When you're the best friend a man ever had?
Tell me why, why, why do you make me so mad, so mad
When you're the best friend a man ever had?


Well, I wake up in the morning, I'm still dreaming 'bout you
Tell you, pretty baby, I'm blue
Wake up in the evening, I'm still screaming out
Over you, over you

Well, tell me why, why, why do you treat me so bad, so bad
When you're the best friend a man ever had?

Well, I wake up in the morning, I'm still dreaming 'bout you
I tell you, pretty baby, I'm blue
Wake up in the evening, I'm still screaming out
Over you, over you

Tell me why, why, why do you make me so sad, so sad
When you're the best friend a man has ever had?

Well, I wake up in the morning, I'm still dreaming 'bout you
I tell you, pretty baby, I'm blue
Wake up in the evening, I'm still screaming out
Over you, over you

Well, tell me why, why, why do you treat me so bad, so bad
When you're the best friend a man ever had?
Well, when you're the best friend a man could ever have?
