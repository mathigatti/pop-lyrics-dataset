Ladies and gentlemen
Standing before you
With something important to say
With some trepidation
I crave your attention
But I'm not gonna let anything get in my way
The message is simple
It's straight from my heart
And I know that you've heard it before
But what does it matter
We're in it together
And I'm not quitting
While people are crying for more


People want peace
People want peace
A simple release from their suffering
People want peace
People want peace

Nothing in life is as sad as a lonely soul
Searching for peace
Only to find disappointment is waiting
Behind every door that we open
Every catch we release

A-brothers and sisters
I beg you to listen
I know that it isn't too late
For we as the people
The voices of freedom
And we're all perfectly clear
That we don't wanna wait

People want peace
People want peace
A simple release from their suffering
People want peace
People want peace

People want peace
People want peace
Yes, we want peace!
People want peace
People want peace
