Now the weekend's here
I plan to have some fun
Take you out in my Oldsmobile, and head for the country, hon
Say, hey! It's a fine day! Yeh, yeh, such a fine day
Say, hey! It's a fine day! I hope to hear you headin' my way


Yeh, yeh! It's a fine day! Checkbook on another fine day
Hey, hey! It's a fine day! I'm glad to see you headin' my way

Friday night I took you dancin'!
We danced all the way
Sunday mornin' we relaxin'
At your mother's home
Hey, it's a fine day! Sha-yay-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh it's a fine day, fine day
Oh yeh, it's a fine day. I'm glad to see you headin' my way

Oh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh

Well, should leave I took her to the evening classes
Where you learn to read a book
Wednesday morning took me to the playground
Were you lead to take a look?
Hey! It's a fine day! Yeh yeh, ha ha ha oh, such a fine day!
Ha ha ha hey hey, it's a fine day! I'm glad to see you headin' my way

Oh hey hey! It's a fine day! Hey, hey! Such a fine day!
Hey hey it's a fine day! And I'm glad to see you headin' my way
Hey hey! A fine day! Hey such a fine day! hey it's such a fine day!
