Ah, no one ever left alive in 1985 will ever do
She may be right, she may be fine
She may get love
But she won't get mine cause I got you
Oh, I, oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind


Shake it, shake it or break it

Ah, my mama said the time will come
When I will find myself in love with you
I didn't think, I never dreamed
That I would be around to see it all come true
Oh, I, oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind

Ah, no one ever left alive in 1985 will ever do
She may be right, she may be fine
She may get love
But she won't get mine cause I got you
Oh, I, oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind

Band on the run, the band on the run
Band on the run, yeah, the band on the run
