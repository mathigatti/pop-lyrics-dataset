People gathered here tonight
I want you to listen to me!
To your left and to you right
You've got some pretty soily company


Reader, writer, farmer, priest
Breed controler, born deceased
Indian, lawyer, doctor, dog
And a plumber with a fattened hog

Soily, soily
The cat in satin trousers said it's oily
Soily, soily
The cat in satin trousers said it's oily
you know he's right

Romans, Italians, country men
I want you to listen to me!
I've said it twice and I'll say it again
We've got some pretty soily company

Liar, cheater, jungle chief
Saint, believer on relief
Action painter, Hitler's son
And a commie with a tommy gun

Soily, soily
The cat in satin trousers said it's oily
Soily, soily
The cat in satin trousers said it's oily
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Soily, soily
The cat in satin trousers said it's oily
Soily, soily
