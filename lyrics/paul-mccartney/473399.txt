You've got a lot,
And from what you've got,
I'd say ou're doing well, dear.
Dressed like a dream,
And if things are what they seem,
You're looking swell, dear.


Your little man
Brings you trinkets when he can,
But he can't stay, sear.
That's very well,
But inside your shiny shell,
You dance all day, dear.

So go, begay,
Let your feelings leap away
Into the laughter.
San ferry anne,
And the world keeps turning happy ever after.
