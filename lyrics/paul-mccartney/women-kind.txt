Women kind they have a terrible time,
From the age of 10' they're chased by men,
Oh, what a crime!


The women kind they have a terrible time
It's from the age of 10' they're chased by men,
Oh, what a crime!

Burn your bra,
Stand up pride,
And they will come,
When the time is right.
- Right, fellas?
- Right!

Women kind, oh!, they have a terrible time
It's from the age of 10' they're chased by men,
Oh, committing a crime!

Burn your bras,
Stand up pride,
- Right fellas?

And they will come,
When the time is right.
- Right, fellas?

Women kind they have a terrible time
And the age of 10', you know, they're chased by men,
Oh, what a crime!
Oh, what a crime against women kind!
