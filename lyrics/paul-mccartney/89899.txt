I tried to get over you
I tried to find something new
But all I could ever do
Was fill my time
With thoughts of you


I tried to go somewhere old
To search for my pot of gold
But all I could ever hold
Inside my mind
Were thoughts of you

I hear your music
And it's driving me wild
Familiar rhythms
In a different style
I hear your music
And it's driving me wild again

Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again

I hear your music
And it's driving me wild
Familiar rhythms
In a different style
I hear your music
And it's driving me wild again

Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again

Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again

Ad lib to end
