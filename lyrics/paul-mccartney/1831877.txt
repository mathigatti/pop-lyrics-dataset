When you were young and your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry


Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)

What does it matter to you?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You got to give the other fellow hell

You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry

Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)
