We came from nowhere
Hiding from a storm
We cling together
To keep each other warm


The road to somewhere
Streches through the night
We follow blindly
Heading from the light

I can't see anymore
The blinding light
It's just a metaphor
I use when things aren't going right

We held each other
Praying for a spark
Two crazy partners
Scrambling in the dark

Now were are we going
Searching in the night
We had a feeling
It's going to be alright

I can't see anymore
The blinding light
It's just a metaphor
I use when things aren't going right

Two crazy partners
Searching in the night
We've got a feeling
It's going to be alright

We follow blindly
Heading from the light
We've got a feeling
It's gonna be
It's going to be alright

We came from nowhere
Hiding from a storm
We cling together
To keep each other warm

The road to somewhere
Streches through the night
We follow blindly
Heading from the light
Heading from the light
