What The Hell Gives The Right To Tell Me What To Do With My
Life?
Especially When You Made A Mess Of Every Chance You Had To
Success.
Look At You... Just Look At You. I Said I'm Angry Just
Looking At You.
I'm Sick And Tired Of Sitting Back Listening To All Of
Your Clap-Trap
If You Could Get Me To Take The Rap I Guarantee
You'd Leave Me With A Backslap.
Push Me To The Left, Push Me To The Right Try To Take Me
Out Of The Way
Ven If You Kick Me Off The Edge Of The World,
You're Still Going To Hear Me Say...
When The Hell Gives You The Right To Tell Me What To Do With
My Life?
Especially When You Made A Mess Of Every Chance You Have To
Success.
Look At You. Oh Look At You. I Said I'm Angry Just Looking At
You.
Shouting Down Again Mahama. Shouting Down Again.
Shouting Down Agaun Mahama. Shouting Down Again.
I Can't Begin To Tell You All The Reasons
Why You're Making Me Crazy.
I've Got So Many Answers.
Like You're Stupid, Like You're Crooked, Like You're Lazy.
Hit Me With Your Left, Hit Me With Your Right.
Hit Me From The Top To The Toe.
Even When You Chew Me Up And Spit Me Out,
I'm Still Going To Want To Know.
