I know a tiny waterfall
A magic little place
Where we can play together
And watch the fishes race


Children, children, where are you, children?
Hiding in the forest playing in the rain
I hope you're not too far away
For me to see again

I know where there's a fairy
Who will invite us all to tea
But she won't let me in alone
You'll have to come with me

Children children, where are you, children?
Hiding in the forest playing in the rain
I hope you not too far away
For me to see again

I know a tiny waterfall
A magic little place
Where we can play together
And watch the fishes race

Children children, where are you, children?
Hiding in the forest playing in the rain
I hope you're not too far away
For me to see again
