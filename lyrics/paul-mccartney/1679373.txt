You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down


I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
And this is the bit I don't know the words
But I don't think I'm even bother to try
Learn them before the end of the tour
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Yeah oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go

I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Boy, you're going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
Oh yeah, you break down
Wow yeah, you break down
Wow yes, you break down
