Piece of cake!

Too many people going underground
Too many reaching for a piece of cake
Too many people pulled and pushed around
Too many waiting for that lucky break


That was your first mistake
You took your lucky break and broke it in two
Now what can be done for you?
You broke it in two

Too many people sharing party lines
Too many people never sleeping late
Too many people paying parking fines
Too many hungry people losing weight

That was your first mistake
You took your lucky break and broke it in two
Now what can be done for you?
You broke it in two

Too many people preaching practices
Don't let them tell you what you wanna be
Too many people holding back, this is
Crazy and maybe it's not like me

That was your last mistake
I find my love awake and waiting to be
Now what can be done for you?
She's waiting for me
