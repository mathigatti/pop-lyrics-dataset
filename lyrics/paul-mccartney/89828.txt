When you're wide awake
Say it for goodness sake
It's gonna be a great day
While you're standing there
Get up and grab a chair
It's gonna be a great day


And it won't be long, oh no
It won't be long, it won't be long no no
It won't be long, it won't be long oh no
It won't be long, it won't be long ooh yeah

Ooh, ooh, yeah
Gonna be a great day

And it won't be long, oh no
It won't be long, it won't be long no no
It won't be long, it won't be long oh no
It won't be long, it won't be long oh

When you're wide awake
Say it for goodness sake
It's gonna be a great day
While you're standing there
Get up and grab a chair
It's gonna be a great day
