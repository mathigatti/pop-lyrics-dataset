Yvonne is the one I´ve been counting on
She said so long you´re not the only one, and so I said so long Yvonne
When I first saw Yvonne vulcanos erupted, and happiness started into her life
She walked so tall, she walked so down, everything about her was so grand
And now she´s gonna keep us apart do do do do do
Yvonne is the one, I´ve been counting on
She said so long you´re not the only one, and so I said so long Yvonne
When I saw her again I was caught in the landslide
But I didn´t dare let it show,
Her ruby lips were teasing me, and jealousy would never let us be
(and now she´s gonna keep us apart)
She never knew how much I loved her, I never got to tell her
We never knew how much I loved her, I never got to tell her
We never found a way to say farewell,
Yvonne do do do do do do do do do
When I last saw Yvonne, she was covered in roses
And sadness started into her life,
She walked so tall, she walked so down
everything about her was so strong
Yvonne is the one I´ve been counting on
She said so long you´re not the only one,
and so I said so long Yvonne
