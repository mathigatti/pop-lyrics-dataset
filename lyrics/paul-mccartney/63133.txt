Man We Was Lonely 
Yes We Was Lonely 
And We Was Hard Pressed to Find a Smile 


Man We Was Lonely 
Yes We Was Lonely 
But Now Were Fine All The While 

I Used to Ride on My Fast City Line 
Singing Songs That I Thought Were Mine Alone 
Now Let Me Lie With My Love For The Time I Am Home 

Man We Was Lonely 
Yes We Was Lonely 
And We Was Hard Pressed to Find a Smile 

Man We Was Lonely 
Yes We Was Lonely 
But Now Were Fine All The While 

Now Let Me Lie With My Love For The Time I Am Home 

Man We Was Lonely 
Yes We Was Lonely 
And We Was Hard Pressed to Find a Smile 

Man We Was Lonely 
Yes We Was Lonely 
But Now Were Fine All The While 
But Now Were Fine All The While 
But Now Were Fine All The While
