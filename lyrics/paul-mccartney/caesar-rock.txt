She’s a rock
She’s a rock
She’s a rock


If I could find the words
To talk about my woman
Well, I would surely shout them out
But every time I feel my inspiration coming
It's all too much, it won't come out

'Cause she break me up
She takes me down
She sends me sideways
She gets me every way I turn

If I’m back to school
She gotta be my favourite teacher
There’s such a lot for me to learn

She’s a rock (yeah)
She’s a rock (yeah)
She’s a rock (yeah)

Somehow she always knows
Exactly what is needed
When I’ve been running round and round
And if she wants me
I know that I’ve succeeded
I’ll be heading back to town

She’s a rock (yeah)
She’s a rock (yeah)
She’s a rock (yeah)

She’s a rock
She’s a rock
She’s a rock
She's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a
She's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a
Yeah now she's a rock (she's a rock)

Woo-hoo-hoo
She got loyalty
Like the royalty
She got symmetry
Anonymity
She got all the looks
She got all the books
She got matching teeth
She got matching teeth!
