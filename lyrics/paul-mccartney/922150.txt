Said farewell to my last hotel,
It never was much kind of abode.
Glasgow town never brought me down
When i was heading out on the road.
Carlisle city never looked so pretty
And the kendal freeway's fast,
Slow down, driver, wanna stay alive,
I wanna make this journey last.


Helen, (helen) hell on wheels,
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels.
Helen, (helen) hell on wheels,
And they never gonna take her away.

Oh!

M6 south down to liverpool
Where they play the west coast sound.
Sailor sam he came from birmingham
But he never will be found.
Doin' fine when a london sign
Greets me like a long lost friend,
Mister motor, won't you check her out,
She's got to take me back again.

Helen, (helen) hell on wheels,
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels.
Helen, (helen) hell on wheels,
And they never gonna take her away.

Got no time for a rum and lime,
I wanna get my right foot down. (get my right foot down)
Shake some dust off this old bus,
I gotta get her out of town. (get her out of town)
Spend the day upon the motorway
Where the carburettors blast. (carburettors blast)
Slow down, driver, wanna stay alive,
I wanna make this journey last.

Helen, (helen) hell on wheels,
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels.
Helen, (helen) hell on wheels,
And they never gonna take her away.

Say bye-bye!

Two! three! four!
A one! two! three! four!
One! two! three! four!
