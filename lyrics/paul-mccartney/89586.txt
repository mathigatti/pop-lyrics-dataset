The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear.
I've seen that road before,
It always leads me here, lead me to your door


The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Don't leave me waiting here (don't keep me waiting)
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road.
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here,
Lead me to your door
Don't keep me waiting here,
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back to the long and winding road.
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here,
Lead me to your door
Don't keep me waiting here,
Lead me to your door
