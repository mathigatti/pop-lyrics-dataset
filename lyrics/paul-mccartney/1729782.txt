Cracks in the pavement,
Cracks in the road,
Cracks in the ceiling
Where the bathtube overflowed, overflowed.


Uh!

Holes in the gutters,
Holes in the slate,
Holes in the carpet
But i won't evacuate.

I love this house, it's where i'll stay,
Eat and sleep the night and day.
I love this house, it's where i'll be,
For you to spend some time with me,
I love this house.

Damp in the basement,
Damp in the hall,
Damp in the living room
That's climbing up the wall, up the wall.

Rust in the drainpipe,
Rust in the spout
Rust in the radiators
Still won't get me out.

I love this house, it's where i'll stay,
Eat and sleep the night and day.
I love this house, it's where i'll be,
For you to spend some time with me,
I love this house.

Hot in the summer, rattling windows, teeth and knees,
Perfect place for cat and mouse,
But i never mind, i love this house.

Ow!

Cracks in the pavement,
Cracks in the road,
Cracks in the ceiling
Where the bathtube overflow.

Holes in the gutters,
Holes in the slate,
Holes in the carpet
But i won't evacuate.

I love this house, it's where i'll stay,
To eat and sleep the night and day.
I love this house, it's where i'll be,
For you to spend some time with me,
I love this house.
