You're talking to me from the back of my car
And i can't get nothing right
And then you wonder why stand at the bar
Day and night
Chorus


I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no no
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no no

You stand behind me with a watch in your hand
And i can't get nothing done
Well, people tell me you're punctual man
But come on

Chorus

I earn the money and you take it away
When i don't know where you're from
I should be worried but they say
It'll pay for a bomb

Chorus

I've had enough

Baby you know sometimes you get a little weary
But if it ever happens honey
You just come along to me
Because you know

Chorus
