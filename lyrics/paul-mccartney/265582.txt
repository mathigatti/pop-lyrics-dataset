Laugh, when your eyes are burning
Smile, when your heart is filled with pain


Sigh, as you brush away your sorrow
Make a vow, that it's not gonna happen again

It's not right, in one life
Too much rain

You, know the wheels keep turning
Why, do the tears run down your face

We, use to hide away our feelings
But for now, tell yourself it won't happen again

It's not right, in one life
Too much rain

It's too much for anyone
Too hard for anyone
Who wants a happy and peaceful life
You've gotta learn to laugh

(guitar solo)

Smile, when you're spinning round and round
Sigh, as you think about tomorrow
Make a vow, that you're gonna be happy again

It's all right, in your life
No more rain

It's too much for anyone
Too hard for anyone
Who wants a happy and peaceful life
You've gotta learn to laugh
