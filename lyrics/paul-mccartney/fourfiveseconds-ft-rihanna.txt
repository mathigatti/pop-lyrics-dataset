I think I’ve had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what’s on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness is taken for weakness


Now I’m fourfiveseconds from wildin’
And we got three more days ’til Friday
I’m just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin’
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shining, I’m positive
Then I heard you was talkin’ trash
Hold me back, I’m bout’ to spaz

Yeah, I’m fourfiveseconds from wildin’
And we got three more days ’til Friday
I’m just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin’
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

And I know that you're up tonight
Thinking how could I be so selfish
But you called 'bout a thousand times wondering where I've been

Oh, I know that you’re up tonight
Thinkin’ how could I be so reckless
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

If I go to jail tonight
Promise you’ll pay my bail
See, they want to buy my pride
But that just ain’t up for sale
See, all of my kindness, hmm, is taken for weakness

I’m fourfiveseconds from wildin’
And we got three more days ’til Friday
I’m just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin’
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Oh, fourfiveseconds from wildin’
And we got three more days ’til Friday
I’m just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin’
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
