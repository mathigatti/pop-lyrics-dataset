Desmond has a barrow in the market place,
Molly is the singer in a band.
Desmond says to molly, "girl, I like your face,"
And molly says this as she takes him by the hand:


Obladi, oblada, life goes on, bra,
Lala how their life goes on.
Obladi, oblada, life goes on, bra,
Lala how their life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store,
Buys a twenty carat golden ring.
Takes it back to molly waiting at the door,
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing:

Obladi, oblada, life goes on, bra,
Lala how their life goes on.
Obladi, oblada, life goes on, bra,
Lala how their life goes on.

In a couple of years,
They have built a home sweet home.
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of desmond and molly jones.

Happy ever after in the market place,
Desmond lets the children lend a hand.
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face,
And in the evening she still sings it with the band.

Obladi, oblada, life goes on, bra,
Lala how their life goes on.
Obladi, oblada, life goes on, bra,
Lala how their life goes on.

In a couple of years,
They have built a home sweet home.
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of desmond and molly jones.

Happy ever after in the market place,
Molly lets the children lend a hand.
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face,
And in the evening she's a singer with the band.

Obladi, oblada, life goes on, bra,
Lala how their life goes on.
Obladi, oblada, life goes on, bra,
Lala how their life goes

And if you want some fun, take obladiblada.
