We... Wasted Time And Again
On Things... Things We Already Knew
Born To Do... I Give My Love To You


Whenever You Get Some Time
Whenever You Get Some Time
I'd Like To Roll It All
Up In Ball
And Spend It With You
You've Got The Power Of Love
And Love Has The Power, To Make It Come True
We Can Go Through Our Love
We Can Do Things That They Said Were Impossible
Through Our Love
We Can Do All That We Want To Do
We Can Go Through Our Love
We Can Go Through Our Love

Whenever You Will Be Mine
Whenever You Will Be Mine
I Want To Be With You
Just Want To Do Whatever Feels Right
You've Got The Power Of Love
And Love Has The Power To Turn On The Light

Here We Go Through Our Love
We Can See Things That They Said Were Invisible
Through Our Love
We Can See Where We Are Going To
We're Going Through Our Love
Through Our Love We Can Learn To Do Things That They Said Were
Impossible
Through Our Love
We Can Be Blessed With A Better View
We Can Go Through Our Love
We Can Go Through Our Love
We Can Go Through Our Love
