Well now, love my baby, talk about it
Well I don't care, but I wanna shout it
Love my baby and it's good enough for me!
Well I love my baby and I wanna shout
I don't know what she's talking about
But I love my baby and that's good enough for me


Love her in the evening time
Love her in the night
Love her in the morning
When the moon is big and bright, that's right!

Now, love my baby, wanna shout
Oh don't know what she's talking about
But I love my baby and that's good enough for me..

Well I love my baby, that's good enough for me!

That's right!
