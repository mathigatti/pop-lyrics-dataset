She Makes Me Go So Wrong.
(Yeah You Kept Me Awake You Know You Did)
I've Loved Her Oh So Long.
(So Why Don't You Come Right Out And Say It, Stupid)?
She Makes Me Do Things I Don't Want To Do,
I Don't Know Why I Should Be Telling You
I Know That You Want Her Too.
My Intentions Are Quite Sincere,
(That's Not What You Said The Other Night)
And All You Can Do Is Sneer,
(Go Ahead And Kid Yourself You're Right)
She Makes Me Do Things I Don't Want To Do,
I Don't Know Why I Should Be Telling You
I Know That You Want Her Too.
I've Got A Better Chance Than You Do,
I Know That You Want Her Too.
You're Such A Hopeless Romantic
She Told Me You're So Predictable And Nice,
She Only Did You A Favour Once Or Twice,
Once Or Twice.
She Makes Me Go So Wrong.
(So Why Don't You Lie Back And Enjoy It)?
My Conscience Is Clear And Strong
(Yes She Says I'm Just The Boy For It).
She Makes Me Do Things I Don't Want To Do,
I Don't Know Why I Should Be Telling You
I Know That You Want Her Too,
I Know That You Want Her Too,
I Know That You Want Her Too.
