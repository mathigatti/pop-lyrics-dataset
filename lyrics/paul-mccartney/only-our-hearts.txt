If only my love was here
I'd be taking the time to feel it
Washing over my body and soul
If only my love, only my love was here


I wish that my heart was strong
I'd be letting it beat, much faster
At the thought of you holding me near
I wish that my heart, wish that my heart was strong

Hoping to be where you are
Of longing to be your lover
Don't want to ever be far
Apart from you my love

But only our hearts will know
If were going to spend it together
Only gone to the dreams that we share
Only our hearts, know how much love is there

Hoping to be where you are
Of longing to be your lover
I don't want to ever be far
Apart from you my love

But only our hearts will know
If were gonna to spend it together
Holding on to the love that we share
Only our hearts, know how much love is there
Yes only our hearts, know how much love is there
