Ev'ry night I just wanna go out,
Get out of my head.
Ev'ry day I don't wanna get up,
Get out of my bed.
Ev'ry night I want to play out
And ev'ry day I wanna do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
But tonight I just wanna stay in
And be with you-oo,
And be with you.


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
Believe me, momma.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

Ev'ry day I lean on a lamp post,
I'm wasting my time.
Ev'ry night I lay on a pillow,
Just resting my mind.
Ev'ry morning brings a new day
And ev'ry night that day is through.
But tonight I just wanna stay in
And be with you-oo,
And be with you.

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, believe me.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, believe me.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, and be with you.
