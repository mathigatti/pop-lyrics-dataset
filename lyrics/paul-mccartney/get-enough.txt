There was a time when we walked by the docks
I told you I'd need you all of my life
And watching the chugs rolling by together
Do you remember?


Do you remember the lights on the shore?
How they reflected the rain on the road?
I believed that you loved me alone
It was real
Do you remember?

Now and then I see your face
I've been wanting your loving embrace
I've been looking for love but it gets me nowhere
Oh, yeah, yeah

Get enough, get enough, get enough of
Get enough, get enough, get enough of
I can't get enough of, of you

It was a time we were all full of hope
Saw the future burning bright
As we watched the moon rolling out to sea
Do you remember?

But those days are erased from my mind
I've left all those old days behind
Still I remember your face forever, forever

Get enough, get enough, get enough of
Get enough, get enough, get enough of
I can't get enough of, of you

Get enough, get enough, get enough, girl
Get enough, get enough, get enough, girl
I can't get enough
Enough of you
