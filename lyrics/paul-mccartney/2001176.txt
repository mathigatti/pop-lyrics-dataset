What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The Sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine
My valentine


As days and nights
Would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared
A love so fine
My valentine

And I will love her for life
And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain
That I can fly

And so I do
Without a care
I know that someday soon
The Sun is gonna shine
And she'll be there
This love of mine
My valentine

What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The Sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine
My valentine
