I saw a cat with a machine in his brain
The man who fed him said
He didn't feel any pain
I'd like to see that man take out that machine
And stick it in his own brain
You know what I mean


I saw a rabbit with its eyes full of tears
The lab that owned her had
Been doing it for years
Why don't we make them pay for every last eye
That couldn't cry its own tears
Do you know what I mean?

When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow

Well I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow
When we're looking for changes

I saw a monkey that was learning to choke
A guy beside him gave him cigarettes to smoke
And everytime that monkey started to cough
The bastard laughed his head off
Do you know what I mean

When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow

When we're looking for changes
We're looking for changes
We're looking for changes
We're looking for changes in the way we are
