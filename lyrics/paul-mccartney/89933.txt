You give me power to get out of bed
When in the morning I'm feeling dead
Living and loving there's a lot to be said it's true


Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you

Out of the darkness and into the light
Straight to the centre of everything right
Darling don't worry the sky will be bright and blue

When I say it about you
Gonna say it about you
I'll say it about you

When did you teach me to fly thru the air
Sooner or later we all will be there
I read the headlines and now I can swear it's true

And they said it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you
