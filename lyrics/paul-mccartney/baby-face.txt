Baby face
You’ve got the cutest little baby face
There’s not another who can take your place
Woah, baby face
My poor heart is jumpin’
You sure have started something


Baby face
I’m up in heaven when I’m in your firm embrace
I didn’t need a shove
I just went and fell in love
With pretty little baby
Talkin’ bout a little baby
Pretty, pretty little baby face

Baby face
You've got the cutest little tootsie face
There's not another who can take your place
My baby, baby face
Well my poor heart is jumpin'
Cause you know you went and started somethin'

Baby Face
I'm up in heaven
When I'm in your firm embrace
I didn't need a shove
Cause I went and fell in love
With your pretty little baby
Pretty little baby
Talking ‘bout a little baby face
