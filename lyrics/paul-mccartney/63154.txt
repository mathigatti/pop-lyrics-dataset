I got a little woman I can really love, 
My woman fit me like a little glove. 
You know I'll always love 
my little woman love. 


I take her home most ev'ry night, 
My woman love to hold me tight. 
You know I feel alright 
my little woman mine. 

Oh yeah, oh yeah, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 

I take her home most ev'ry night, 
My woman love to hold me tight. 
You know I feel alright, 
my little woman mine.
