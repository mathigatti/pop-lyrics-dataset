If you only knew
How much it meant to me
You'd understand
And I would feel
Your love was true
This is all I want
This is all I need
This is all I long for, I do


Just remember this
After a time it's through
And nevermore
Will there be days
For me and you
This is all I ask
All I ask of you
Please remember darling, I do
Love you

Days go by so quickly
When you're having fun
But life is never easy
Even in the sun

Please remember this
After a time it's through
And nevermore
Will there be days
For me and you

This is all I want
This is all I need
Darling please remember, I do
Love you

If you only knew
