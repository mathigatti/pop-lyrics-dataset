I get a feeling when they call my name
Feels like we're all involved in some kind of game
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, let me out of here
I hear the taxman knocking at my door
I've got a feeling he'll be asking for more


Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, someone get me out of here
When we fight I don't know what to say
It feels so bad and yet I can't run away
Oh boy, oh boy someone get me out of here

I'm a celebrity
Oh boy, someone get me out of here
I see the doctor coming down the street
I got no fever, but I'm feeling the heat
Oh boy, someone get me out of here
