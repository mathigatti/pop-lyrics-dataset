I can't believe it,
Somthing happened to me not so long ago.
I know it isn't something i dreamed about,
It's real, so real.


When she looks into his eyes i feel
Love come tumbling down,
Love come tumbling down,
And it isn't gonna stop
'til i get to the bottom of this whole affair.

I saw the look she gave,

It's one of those things you don't wanna talk about.

Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down,
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down.

So let's forget it,

I know it isn't something to brag about,
It's real, so real.

When she looks into his eyes i feel
Love come tumbling down,
Love come tumbling down,
And it isn't gonna stop
'til i get down to the bottom of this whole affair.

I saw the look she gave,

It's one of those things you don't wanna talk about.

Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down,
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down.

It's real, so real.

When she looks into his eyes i feel
Love come tumbling down,
Love come tumbling down,
And it isn't gonna stop
'til i get down to the bottom of this whole affair.

Ooh-ooh -

Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down,
Love come tumbling down.
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down,
Love come tumbling down.
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down,
Love come tumbling down.
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down,
Love come tumbling down.
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down,
Love come tumbling down.
Love.
