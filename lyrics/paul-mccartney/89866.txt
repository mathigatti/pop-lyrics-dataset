Just leave it to me, now don't you ever be changed,
just give me a chance and I'll take care of everything.
Your troubles I share, I'll let you know when I'll be there.
I'll take care, take care of you, any place and everywhere.
Shake a hand, shake a hand, a-shake a hand if you can.
Shake a hand, shake a hand, shake a hand if you can.


Be truthful to me and I'll be truthful to you.
But I'm in love, I'm in love with your soul, and I don't now just what to do.
So let's call it a day, I've said all I've gotta say
except, oh yeah, baby, you gotta learn how to pray and shake a hand every day.

Be truthful to me and I'll be truthful to you.
But I'm in love, I'm in love with your soul, and I don't now just what to do.
So shake a hand, shake a hand, shake a hand if you can.
Shake a hand, shake a hand, shake a hand if you can
