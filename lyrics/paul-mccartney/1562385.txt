My heart cries out for love
And all that goes with loving
Love in song - love in song
My, you're so fine
When love is mine
I can't go wrong,
Love in song - love in song


I can see the places that
We used to go to now
Happiness in the homeland

Happiness in the homeland

My eye cries out
A tear still born
Misunderstanding
Love in song - love in song

I can see the places that
We used to go to now
Happiness in the homeland

Happiness in the homeland

My, you're so fine
When love is mine
I can't go wrong,
Love in song - love in song - love in song.
