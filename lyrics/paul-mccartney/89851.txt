There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And we call it Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay


You can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears

Going down to Lonesome Town,
Where the broken hearts stay
I'm going down to Lonesome Town,
To cry my troubles away

And in the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
Well I can learn to forget

Lead solo

Going down to Lonesome Town,
Where the lonely hearts stay
I'm going down to Lonesome Town,
To cry, to cry my troubles away

And in the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget

Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget
