When was that summer when the skies were blue?
The bright red cardinal flew down from it's tree?
You tell me


When was that summer when it never rained?
The air was buzzin' with the sweet old honeybee
Let's see
You tell me

Were we there?
Was it real?
Is it truly how I feel?
Maybe
You tell me

[Solo]

Were we there?
Is it true?
Was I really there with you?
Let's see
You tell me

When was that summer of a dozen words?
The butterflies and hummingbirds flew free
Let's see
You tell me

Let's see
You tell me
