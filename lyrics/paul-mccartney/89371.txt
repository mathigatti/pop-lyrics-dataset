You Sailed Away One Night In June
I Heard You Say You Would Be Back Soon
But Since That Day It's Been On Long Loon


Oh - Sweet Darling The Mess I'm In

I Spoke To Jimmy With The Big Tattoo
Said Had He Seen Any Sign Of You
He Looked At Me And Then Laughed At You
See Just Wait A Minute, Oh Darling What A Mess I'm In

When I Want Ya Do I Get Ya
All I Needed Your Number,
Will You Give Me Your Number

Oh Sweet Darling
Oh Sweet Darling
Oh - Sweet Darling What A Mess I'm In
What A Mess I'm In, Since You Left Me
What A Mess I'm In, Oh Yeah
Oh Oh - Oh Oh Wo - Wo
Oh Oh - Oh Wo,Wo Wo

When You're Near Me
Can You Hear Me
I Can't See Ya
I Can Feel Ya
When You're Near Me
Can Ya Hear Me
