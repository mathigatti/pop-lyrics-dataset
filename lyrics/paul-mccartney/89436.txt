Feel like you've never fit before

Here we are
Where are we
Cast adrift on some uncharted sea
I know we'll find our way
I know we'll reach the end
If you will say you'll be my secret friend


Night draws in, once again
As she turns her velvet collar up
A perfect day will end
If you will say you'll be my secret friend

Feel like you've never fell before, once more

Night draws in, once again
As she turns her velvet collar up
A perfect day will end
If you will say you'll be my secret friend

Feel like you've never felt before. once more

Here we are
Where are we
Cast adrift on some uncharted sea
I know we'll find our way
If you will say you'll be my secret friend

Feel like you've never felt before, once more

I need ya
I need ya
I need ya
I need ya

Night draws in, once again
As she turns her velvet collar up
A perfect day will end
If you will say you'll be my secret friend

Feel like you've never felt before, once more

Here we are
Where are we
Cast adrift on some uncharted sea
I know we'll find our way
I know we'll reach the end
If you will say you'll be my secret friend

I need ya
I need ya
I need ya
