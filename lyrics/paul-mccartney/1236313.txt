You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him (anna)
Go with him (anna)


Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searchin' for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now... but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searchin' for a girl
To love me like I love you
But let me tell you now... but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him (anna)
Go with him (anna)
You can go with him, girl (anna)
Go with him
