For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intricacies of life
We could jaw through the night


Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like
Oh yeah

But we always came back to the songs we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah we always came back to the songs we were singing
At any particular time

Take a sip, see the world through a glass
And speculate about the cosmic solution
To the sound, blue guitars
Caught up in a philosophical discussion

Oh yeah

But we always came back to the songs we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah we always came back to the songs we were singing
At any particular time

For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intricacies of life
Yeah, we could jaw through the night

Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like
But we always came back to the songs we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah we always came back to the songs we were singing
At any particular time

Yeah, we always came back

Take a sip, see the world through a glass
And speculate about the cosmic solution
To the sound, blue guitars
Caught up in a philosophical discussion
Oh yeah

But we always came back to the songs we were singing
At any particular time
Yes we always came back to the songs we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah

We always came back to the songs we were singing
