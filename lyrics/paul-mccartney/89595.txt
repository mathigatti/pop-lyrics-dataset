It's beautiful outside
An old hand gathers wood
Can he see me sitting here?
His mind is somewhere else
His friend have flown away
He's left out in the cold
He won't sit by my fire
He says he likes it in the snow


Where footprints never go
He likes it in the snow

It's getting dark outside
The old hand's going home
Has he someone waiting there?
Or is he living on his own?
Where footprints never go
He likes it in the snow

White blanket, hiding
The traces of tears
She didn't see

Oh, white blanket
Covers the memory
Of all that used to be
All that used to be

But his heart keeps
Aching in the same old way
He can't help
Feeling that she might
Come back someday

It's beautiful outside,
A magpie looks for food.
The old hand
Throws a crumb,
Do you think
He's found a friend?

Where footprints never go
He likes it in the snow

White blanket
Hiding the traces of paths
He didn't take
Oh, white blanket
Covers the memory
Of moves he didn't make

Oh, white blanket
Hiding the traces of tears she didn't see
Snow white blanket simply covers
The memory
Of all that used to be

But his heart keeps aching in the same old way
He can't help feeling that she might come back someday
