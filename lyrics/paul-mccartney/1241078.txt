This happened once before,
When I came to your door, no reply.
They said it wasn't you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
'Cos I looked up to see your face.
I tried to telephone,
They said that you were not home, that's a lie,
'Cos I know where you've been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I mearly died, I nearly died,
'Cos you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.
If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.
I've tried to telephone,
They said you were not home, that's a lie,
'Cos I know where you've been,
I saw her walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
'Cos you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.
No reply, no reply.
