A-one, a-two

Did you ever get hurt by the words people say
And the things that they do when they're picking on you?
Did you ever get sad by the games that they play
When they're making you feel like a rusty old wheel?


It's been left in the rain

Who cares what the idiots say?
Who cares what the idiots do?
Who cares about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?
I do

'Cause you're worth much more
A fact you can be sure
No need to hide
The love you've got inside

Did you ever get lost in the heart of a crowd
And the people around keep on pushing you down?
Is it driving you mad and you're screaming out loud
And you're wondering who's going to recognize you?

You're a ghost in the dark

Who cares what the idiots say?
Who cares what the idiots do?
Who cares about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?

Who cares what the idiots say?
Who cares what the idiots do?
Who cares about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?
I do

You've been left in the rain
