Well
I missed the Saturday dance
I might have gone, but what for?
It's awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore


Thought I'd visit the club
I got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Oh, darling, I guess
My mind's more at ease
But nevertheless
Why bring back memo-, why bring back memo-
Why bring back memories?

Been invited on dates
I heard they crowded the floor
Doesn't matter without you
Don't get around much anymore

Oh, darling, I guess
My mind's more at ease
But nevertheless
Why bring back memo-, why bring back memo-
Why bring back memories?

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
