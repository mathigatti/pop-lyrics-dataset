I Was Thinking About That Summer So Long Ago
Pack Up Your Bags And Yell "Geronimo".
That Was A Golden Summer, Laught A Lot.
Laughing At The Good Times Coming,
Laughing At The Good Times Coming In.
Good Times Coming, Laughing At The Good Times Coming In.
There Was Something About The Weather, What Can I Say?
Nothing Like Any Other Holiday.
That Was A Silly Season, Was It The Best?
We Didn't Need The Reason, Just A Rest.
Happy At The Good Times Coming,
Happy At The Good Times Coming In.
Good Times Coming, Happy At The Good Times Coming In.
I'm Loving You, I'm Loving You, I'm Loving You Now.
I'm Loving You, I'm Loving You, I'm Loving You Now.
There Was A Golden Summer Before The War
They Laughed A Lot That Summer, Lah De Dah
Laughing At The Good Times Coming,
Laughing At The Good Times Coming In.
Good Times Coming, Laughing At The Good Times Coming In.
Good Times Coming... Good, Good. Good Times Coming In... Good,
Good.
Feel The Sun Shine In, Shine In, Shine In. Feel The Sun
Shining In On You.
Feel The Sun Shine In, Shine In, Shine In. Feel The Sun
Shining In On You.
All The Beauty, All The Pain. Will It Ever Be The Same Again?
If You Love Me, Show Me Now. It's The Only Way That We Know
How.
Feel The Sun Shine In, Shine In, Shine In. Feel The Sun
Shining In On You.
Feel The Sun Shine In, Shine In, Shine In. Feel The Sun
Shining In On You.
