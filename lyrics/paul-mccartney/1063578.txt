They're gonna put me in the movies.
They're gonna make a big star out of me.
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally.


Well, I bet you I'm gonna be a big star.
Might win an Oscar. You can never tell.
The movie's gonna make me a big star,
'Cause I can play the part so well.

Well, I hope you come and see me in the movies.
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally.

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and
lonely
And begging down upon his bendin' knee.
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsing.
All I have to do is act naturally.

Well, I bet you I'm gonna be a big star.
Might win an Oscar. You can never tell.
The movie's gonna make me a big star,
'Cause I can play the part so well.

Well, I hope you come and see me in the movies.
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally.
