Can I Get You To Give Me A Minute Of Your Time?
Can I Get You To Slip Me The Answer?
Can I Get You To Slow Me A Little Of Your Mime?
You Were Always A Very Good Dancer
I'd Be Happy To Show You A Bit Of What I Found
I'd Be Happy To Share In Its Beauty
I'd Be Happy To Lay Low Inevitably Bound
I Would Only Be Doing My Duty.
I Wait, I Wait, I Can Wait, I Can Wait Back In The Bar
I Can Wait, I Can Wait , I Can Wait Back In The Car
I'll Be Waiting For You
Stranglehold, You Know You've Got On Me
I Don't Want To Go Without You.
Stranglehold, You've Got Me Where You Want Me
But I Want To Know More About You I Want To Know More
About You.
Are You Willing To Wager A Little Of Your Life?
Are You Willing To Take Such A Gamble?
Are You Ready To Walk On The Edge Of The Knife?
Then I Think We Can Skip The Preamble.
I Wait, I Wait, I Can Wait. I Can't Wait Back In The Bar,
I Can Wait, I Can Wait, I Can Wait Back In The Car
I'll Be Waiting For You. I'll Be Waiting...
Stranglehold, You Know, You've Got On Me
I Don't Want To Go Without You
Stranglehold, You've Got Me Where You Want Me
And I Want To Know More About You I Want To Know More
About You.
I Can Wait, I Can Wait Back In The Bar I Can Wait, I Can Wait
I Can Wait Back In The Car I'll Be Waiting For You.
