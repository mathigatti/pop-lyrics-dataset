Late at night when the wind is still
I'll come flying through your door,
And you'll know what love is for.
I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird
I'm a bluebird, l'm a bluebird
Yeah ,yeah ,yeah.


I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird,
I'm a bluebird
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Touch your lips with a magic kiss
And you'll be a bluebird too,
And you'll know what love can do.

I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird
I'm a bluebird, l'm a bluebird
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird,
I'm a bluebird,
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bluebird
Ah ha,
Bluebird
Ah ha,
Bluebird.

Fly away through the midnight air
As we head across the sea,
And at last we will be free.

You're a bluebird, you're a bluebird,
You're a bluebird, you're a bluebird
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're a bluebird, you're a bluebird
You're a bluebird
Yeah, yeah ,yeah.

Bluebird
Ah ha,
Bluebird
Ah ha,
Bluebird.

All alone on a desert island
We're living in the trees,
And we're flying in the breeze.

We're the bluebirds, we're the bluebirds
We're the bluebirds, we're the bluebirds
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

We're the bluebirds, we're the bluebirds
We're the bluebirds
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bluebird
Ah ha,
Bluebird
Ah ha,
Bluebird.
