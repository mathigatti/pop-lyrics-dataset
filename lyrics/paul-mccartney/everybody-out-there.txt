Hey, everybody out there
You know what it's like
When you haven't got a life
When you haven't got a life


Hey, do you want to make a differance?
Well stand in the line
If you haven't got the time
I can give you some of mine

Never for the grace of God go you... And I
We're the brightest objects in the sky
Never for the grace of God go you... And I
Do some good before you say goodbye

Hey, I was trying to remember
How bad it was then
When you didn't have a friend
When you didn't have a friend

Hey, everybody out there (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Everybody out there
Hey, everybody out there
Everybody out there

Never for the grace of God go you... And I
We're the brightest objects in the sky
Remember never for the grace of God go you... And I
Do some good before you say goodbye

Hey, everybody out there
Oh, talk to me! I can't hear you, oh yeh yeh yeh yeh
Hey, is anybody out there?
I know what it's like
I know what it's like
Anybody out there, I can't hear you, I can't hear you
Everybody out there
