She makes me feel glad, I want her so bad
My heart is beating madly for her
If you ask me why, I'm not gonna lie
I'll have to say I adore her


Ooh, look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine (so fine so fine)
Step out in front of me baby
They want you in the front line (so fine so fine)
They wanna see your sunshine, oh ya ya

She picks up daisys from a field
She loves to weave them in her hair
I know she knows it isn't real
She still hears music in the air
Its coming from inside her heart
I hope it lasts forver
The sun is shining in the sky
She wants to dance around the world
And though I'd love to be the guy
That gets to walk off with the girl
I'll go along with all she needs
And it will be my pleasure

Ooh, look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine (so fine so fine)
Step out in front of me baby
They want you in the front line (so fine so fine)
They wanna see your sunshine, oh

She makes me feel glad, I want her so bad
My heart is beating madly for her
If you ask me why, I'm not gonna lie
I'll have to say I adore her

Ooh, look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine (so fine so fine)
I wanna see your sunshine
