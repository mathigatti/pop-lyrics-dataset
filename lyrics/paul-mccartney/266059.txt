Ground rice, sugar, vinegar, seco salt
Macaroni too
Cook of the house
I'm the cook of the house


No matter where I serve my guests
They seem to like the kitchen best
'Cause I'm the cook of the house
Cook of the house

The saladâ€™s in the bowl
The rice is on the stove
Green beans in the colander
And where the rest is
Heaven only knows

Cinnamon, garlic, salt, pepper
Cornbread, curry powder, coffee too
Cook of the house
I'm the cook of the house

No, matter where I serve my guests
They seem to like the kitchen best
'Cause I'm the cook of the house
Cook of the house

And the rest is heaven only knows

Cinnamon, garlic, salt, pepper
Cornbread, curry powder, coffee too
Cook of the house
That's the cook of the house
I'm the cook of the house
She's the cook of the house
No matter where I serve my guests
They seem to like the kitchen best

'Cause I'm the cook of the house
That's cook of the house
Cook of the house
She's the cook of the house
Cook of the house
That's the cook of the house
I'm the cook of the house
Take it fellow
