Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh,
Mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh, oh.


Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh,
Mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh, oh.

The rain comes falling from the sky,
To fill the stream that fills the sea.
And that's where life began for you and me.

Ah!
Ah!

So the next time you see rain, it ain't bad,
Don't complain, it rains for you.
The next time you see l.a. rainclouds,
Don't complain, it rains for you and me.

Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh,
Mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh,
Mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh, oh.

It might have been a bright, blue day,
But rainclouds had to come this way.
They're watering everything that they can see.

Ah!
Ah!

A seed is waiting in the earth
For rain to come to give him birth.
It's all he really needs to set him free.

Ah!
Ah!

So the next time you see l.a. rainclouds,
(so the next time you see rain)
Don't complain, (don't complain) it rains for you.

So lay down your umbrellas,
Strip off your plastic macs, ooh,
You've never felt the rain, my friend,
Till you've felt it runnin' down your back.

So the next time you see l.a. rainclouds,
(so the next time you see rain)
Don't complain, (don't complain) it rains for you.
(it ain't bad)
The next time you see l.a. rainclouds,
(so the next time you see rain)
Don't complain, (you see) it rains for you and me.

Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh,
Mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh,
Mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh,
Mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh,
Mamunia, mamunia, oh, oh, oh, oh.
