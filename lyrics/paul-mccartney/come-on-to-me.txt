I saw you flash a smile, that seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation
I swear I caught a look before you turned away
Now I don't see the point resisting your temptation


Did you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?

Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do

I don't think I can wait like I'm supposed to do
How soon can we arrange a formal introduction?
We need to find a place where we can be alone
To spend some special time without an interruption

If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do, yeah
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do

Before you grab your coat, I'll try to be discrete
You know we can't be seen exchanging information
Well, I saw you flash a smile, that seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation

If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you

Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will now
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will now, uh-huh

If you, if come on to me (yeah), then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah (if you come on to me, then I'll come on to you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (if you come on to me, then I'll come on to you)
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll come on to you!
