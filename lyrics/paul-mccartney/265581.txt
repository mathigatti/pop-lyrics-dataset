We were growing, time was going so fast
Without knowing, we were growing up fast


We were lying down, in the shade
I remember the love we made

We were lying down, on the bed
I remember the tears we shared

We were growing, time was going so fast (growing up)
Without knowing (falling down)
We were growing up fast (growing up, falling down)
(Growing up, falling down)

We were laughing to, we were so
I remember the fun we had
We were crying loud, with the pain
We will never be here again

Growing up, falling down
