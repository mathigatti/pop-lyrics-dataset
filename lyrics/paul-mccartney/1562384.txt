Ah, she tastes like wine
Such a human being so divine
Oh she feels like sun
Mother nature look at what you've done
Oh I feel like letting go
Oh I feel like letting go.


Ah, she looks like snow
I wanna put her in a broadway show
Ah she'll dance and dine
Like a lucifer she'll always shine

Oh I feel like letting go
Oh I feel like letting go.

Oh I feel like letting go.

Ah, she sings it so
I want to put her on the radio
One day and there you are
Ladies and gentleman -
A brand new star.

Oh I feel like letting go
Oh I feel like letting go.
