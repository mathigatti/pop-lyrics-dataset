I can’t ask you to thrill me
That’d be asking too much
I can’t ask you to fulfill
My expectations that you gave me
After we first touched
But but the feeling that been building inside me
Is too hard to resist


I can’t wait much longer till you tell me baby
There’s some chance we’ll get together maybe
Sooner or later, I’ll be in with half a chance
I can’t wait till I hear you tell me that you want me
Till then my dreams are gonna haunt me
Got my demons doing such a happy dance
Hey! Ah! Yeah!
Exorcise my demons, cast them out today
Only you can do it, make them go away
Let me know you love me, tell me there’s a chance
I don’t want to sit and watch my demons dance

Watch my demons dance
Watch my demons dance
Oh no, demons dance
Girl I want you to do it
I been waiting so long
Do you have to put me through these complications
When you know I try hard not to be wrong
But but the feeling that been building inside me
Is too hard to resist

Ah, ah, ah
I can’t wait much longer till you tell me baby
There’s a chance we’ll get together maybe
Sooner or later, I’ll be in with half a chance
I can’t wait till I hear you tell me that you want me
Till then my dreams are gonna haunt me
Got my demons doing such a happy dance
Ow! Huh! Yeah!

Come on and exorcise
My demons, cast them out today
Only you can do it, make them go away
Let me know you love me
Tell me there’s half a chance
I can’t sit around and watch those demons dance
Watch my demons dance
Watch my demons dance

Demons dance
Demons dance
Demons dance
Demons dance
