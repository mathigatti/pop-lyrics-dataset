There once was a time when I thought if I had a house, I'd be happy 
There once was a time when I thought if I had a car, I'd be made 


One by one I achieved my ambitions 
But didn't feel like I wanted to feel 
Didn't feel like I wanted it to feel 
I didn't feel like I wanted to feel 

   I needed a comfort of love 
   Any place and anytime 
   I needed a comfort of love 
   Just to get me some piece of mind, wo-oh 

I long for the time when the world is a better place, to be happy 
I long for the day when the people who went to sleep, will awake 

One by one I improved my conditions 
But it doesn't feel like I wanted to feel
Doesn't feel like I wanted it to feel
Doesn't feel like I wanted to feel

   I needed the comfort of love 
   Any place and anytime 
   I need the comfort of love 
   To just to get me some piece of mind, wo-oh 

   I needed a comfort of love 
   Any place and anytime 
   I needed a comfort of love 
   To just to get me some piece of mind 

   Well, I needed the comfort
   I needed the comfort
   I needed the comfort of love
 
   I needed the comfort
   I needed the comforte
   I needed the comfort of love
