Oh, papa catch the fish from the bottom of the sea,
Mama fixes net, she keep an eye on me.
Dainty little mama, smile all day,
Cook your sweet potato, at night she lay, lay.


Oooh, seaside woman,
Oooh, seaside woman.

Ride with mule to market place each day,
Sells her beaten baskets for sea shell pay.
Dainty little mama, smile all day,
Papa love you, mama, and he say, say.

Oooh, seaside woman, (yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)
Oooh, seaside woman.

(alright, slap it on, denny!)

Oooh, seaside woman,
Oooh, seaside woman.

(break it up now) yeh!
(oh, turn around)
(ho ah!)
(oh!)

(i don't wanna walk, i don't wanna talk, i just wanna be with you)

Oh, papa catch the fish from the bottom of the sea,
Mama fixes net, she keep an eye on me.
Dainty little mama, smile all day,
Cook your sweet potato, at night she lay, lay.

Oooh, seaside woman,
Oooh, seaside woman, (mm, mm, hey!)
Oooh, seaside woman, (yeh, yeh, yeh)
Seaside woman,
Seaside woman,
Seaside woman.
