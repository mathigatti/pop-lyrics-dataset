Oh, you should have seen me with the poker man
I had a honey and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time I looked at his hand


I was talking to an eskimo
Said he was hoping for a fall of snow
When up popped a sea lion, ready to go

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to junior's farm where I wanna lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to junior's farm

Oh, at the houses of parliament
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the president
We all chip in for a bag of cement

Ollie hardy should've had more sense
He bought a gee-gee and he jumped the fence
All for the sake of a couple of pence

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's farm where I wanna lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's farm

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's farm where I wanna lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's farm
Everybody tag along

I took my bag into a grocer's store
The price was higher than the time before
Old man ask me: why is it more?

I said: you should have seen me with the poker man
I had a honey and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time I looked at his hand

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's farm where I wanna lay low (down to Junior'sfarm)
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's farm (down to Junior's farm)

Let's go, let's go, let's go,let's go
Down to Junior's farm where I wanna lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's farm, (down to Junior's farm)
Everybody tag along, (long to tag along)
Take me down to Junior's farm

Yes, now
Oh

Ah,ah
Ah,ah
Ah,ah,ah
Take me back
Take me back
I wanna go back, yeah, yeah - yeah
