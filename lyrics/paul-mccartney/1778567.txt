Emotional moments, you left in a rage
But if you could love me now, I wouldn't be in a cage
Provisional license, I'm under arrest
But if you could get me out, I'd like to take another
test


(Aah)

I've been sent to tell you
That the man you were with last night
Is feeling sorry, sorry
But he told me to tell you
That he hardly ever lies
But he lied to you last night

He didn't mean it, no
Said he didn't mean it, no
He didn't mean it, no
Said he didn't mean it, no

I've been sent to tell you
That the man you were with last night
Is feeling lonely only for you
He told me to tell you
That he hardly ever cries
But he cried for you last night, ooh

He didn't mean it, no
Said he didn't mean it, no
He didn't mean it, no
Said he didn't mean it, no

Emotional moment, you left in a rage
But if you could love me now, I wouldn't be in a cage
Dramatic performance, direct from the stage
But if you could get me out, I wouldn't be in a cage
