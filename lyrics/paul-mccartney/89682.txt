On no one left alive in 1985, will ever do
She may be right
She may be fine
She may get love but she won't get mine 'cos I got you
Oh I oh I


Well I just can't enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind

On my mama said the time would come
When I would find myself in love with you
I didn't think I never dreamed
That I would be around to see it all come true
Woh I oh I
Well I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind
