Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away


Wonder this time where she's gone
Is she really going to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too log
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Is she really going to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
