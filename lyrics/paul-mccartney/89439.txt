Like so many girls
Jenny Wren could sing
But a broken heart took her song away


Like the other girls
Jenny Wren took wing
She could see the world
And its foolish ways

How we spend our days
casting love aside
losing sight of life, day by day

She saw poverty
breaking all her home
Wounded warriors took her song away

But the day will come, Jenny Wren will sing
When this broken world mends its foolish ways

Then we spend our days catching up our life
All because of you, Jenny Wren
You saw who we are, Jenny Wren
