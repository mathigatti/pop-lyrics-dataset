Like the sun playing
In the morning
Feel the quiet
Feel the thunder
Every ladder
Leads to heaven
Sing the changes
Draw the picture


Sing the changes
As you're sleeping
Feel the quiet
In the thunder
Sing the changes
Calling over
Feel the quiet
In the thunder

Like the sun playing
In the morning
Feel the quiet
Feel the thunder
Every ladder
Leads to heaven
Colored pencils
Draw the picture

Sing your praises
As you're sleeping
Feel the sense of
Childlike wonder

Sing your praises
As you're sleeping
Sing the changes
Oh as you're sleeping
Feel the quiet
In the thunder
Sing the changes
Calling over

Feel the quiet
In the thunder
Sing your praises
As you're sleeping

Feel the quiet
In the thunder
Sing the changes
Calling over
Everybody has a sense of
Childlike wonder
