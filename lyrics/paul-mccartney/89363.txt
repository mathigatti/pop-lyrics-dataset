I can't get over myself
Falling into the hands of love
Just can't imagine myself
Falling head over heals in love
But when I saw you last night
I knew for the first time
That you were the one I'd been dreaming of
I cant get over myself
Falling into the hands of love
Falling into the hands of love


But when I saw you last night
I knew for the first time
That you were the one I'd been dreaming of
I can't get over myself
Falling into the hands of love
Falling into the hands of love
Love sweet love

But when I saw you last night
I knew for the first time
That you were the one I'd been dreaming of
I can't get over myself
Falling into the hands of love
Falling into the hands of love
Love, sweet love
