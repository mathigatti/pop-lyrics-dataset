How can I hope to reach your love
Help me to discover
What it is you're thinking of


'Cos when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity
Inside your loving flame

What am I to do
If I don't have you
I'll be feeling blue
Just sitting here without you
You could be the one
To chase my blues away, away

So tell me how, how to reach your love
Help me to discover
What it is you're thinking of

'Cos when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity
Inside your loving flame

What am I to do
If I don't have you
I'll be feeling blue
Just sitting here without you
You could be the one
To chase my blues away, away

'Cos when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity
Inside your loving flame

So tell me how, how to reach your love
Help me to discover
What it is you're thinking of

How can I hope to reach your love
Here forever in your loving flame
