Peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday
Wishful, not thinking what to do
We've been calling it love
But it's a dream we're going through


And if I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose

Restful, like Devon on a Monday
Cooling my fingers in the bay
We've been learning a song
But it's a long and lonely blues

If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose

It's peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday
Wishful, not thinking what to do
We've been calling it love
But it's a dream we're going through

And if I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
