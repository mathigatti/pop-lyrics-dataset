Rain in the forest,
Rain in the trees,
Raining down on me.
Rainclouds hide the sun,
Rainclouds hide the sun.


Clouds in the valley,
Clouds in the sky,
Clouds, please, pass me by.

Sail the ocean, sail across the sea,
(sail across the sea)
Send a card to me.
(send a card to me)
Wind's gonna blow, (wind's gonna blow)
And if you go, (oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oh)
Leave the sun for me. (me-ee-ee)

Talkin' 'bout sun in the desert,
(sun in the desert)
Sun in my ears,
(sun in my ears)
Sun dries up my tears.
Rainclouds hide the sun,
(rainclouds hide the sun)
Rainclouds hide the sun.
(rainclouds hide the sun)

Rain in the forest,
(rain in the forest)
Rain on the trees,
(rain on the trees)
Raining down on me.
Rainclouds hide the sun, pretty woman, in the morning,
(rainclouds hide the sun)
Rainclouds hide the sun.
(rainclouds hide the sun)

Rain in the forest,
(rainclouds hide the sun)
Rain on the trees.
(rainclouds hide the sun)

Rainclouds hide the sun.
