I Needed Loving, Needed A Friend
I Needed Something, That Would Be There In The End.
On A Rough Ride To Heaven
Want To Get Inside, What Will I Do?
On A Rough Ride To Heaven,
I Want To Get Inside To Be With You.
I Knew You'd Help Me, I Knew You Could.
You Knew I Didn't Want To Be Misunderstood.
On A Rough Ride To Heaven
Want To Get Inside, What Will I Do?
On A Rough Ride To Heaven,
I Want To Get Inside, To Be With You.
I'm Not Asking For An Easy Passage,
So I Hope You Understand,
I'm Not After Any Special Treatment,
But I Wouldn't Mind A Hand.
On A Rough Ride, On A Rough Ride,
On A Rough Ride, On A Rough Ride,
On A Rough Ride To Heaven,
Want To Get Inside, What Will I Do?
