You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy,
The way you rock and roll.
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy,
When you do the stroll.
Come on, Miss Lizzy,
Love me 'fore I grow too old.


Come on, give me fever.
Put your little hand in mind.
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy.
Ooh, girl, you look so fine.
Just a-rockin' and a-rollin'.
Girl, I said, I wish you were mine.

You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy,
When you call my name.
Whoo, baby, shake.
You're drivin' me insane.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby,
I wanna be your lovin' man.

Come on and tell your Mama,
I want you to be my bride.
Go on and tell your brother,
Baby, don't run and hide.
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy.
Girl, I want to marry you.

Come on, give me fever.
Put your little hand in mine, girl.
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy.
Girl, you look so fine.
You're just a-rockin' and a-rollin'.
Oh, I said I wish you were mine.
