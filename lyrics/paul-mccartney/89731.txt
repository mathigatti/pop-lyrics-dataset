Lucille, please come back where you belong
Lucille, please come back where you belong
You ran off and married
Singin' such a beautiful song


Lucille, please don't do your sister's will
Lucille, please don't do your sister's will
You ran off and married
But I love you still

Well, I woke up this mornin'
Lucille was not in sight
Asked my friends about it
But all their lips were tight

Lucille, please come back where you belong
I'm speaking to you, baby
Singin' such a beautiful song

Well, I woke up this mornin'
Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about it
But all their lips were tight

Lucille, please come back where you belong
I'm speaking to you, baby
You sing such a beautiful song
Come on now, Lucille

Well, I woke up this mornin'
Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about it
But all their lips were tight

Lucille, please come back where you belong
Yeah, I'm speaking to you, baby
Sing such a beautiful song

Well, Lucille, please, don't do your sister's will
Lucille, please, don't you do your sister's will
Well, you ran off and married
But I love you still
