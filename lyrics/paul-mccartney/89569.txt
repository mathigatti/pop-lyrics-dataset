Now I know that it can easily happen
To someone like me
I don't want to step on anybody's toes


Who knows how to find love
Think before you give your answer
Who knows what a mystery may bring

Once in a life I'm a lucky man
If I can find the kind of love
That's gonna last for me

Twice in a lifetime
Is one of those unspoken dreams
We usually reserve for fantasy

Who knows how we find love
Stop before you give your answer
Who knows when a mystery begins

I know, I know
I know because it's happening to me
I know, I know

Twice in a lifetime
Is one of those unspoken dreams
We usually reserve for fantasy

Who knows how we find love
Stop before you give your answer
Who knows when a mystery begins

I know, I know
I know because it's happening to me
I know, I know
