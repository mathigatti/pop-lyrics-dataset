Oh woman, oh why, why, why, why?
What have I done?
Oh woman, oh where, where, where, where, where
Did you get that gun?


Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?

Well I met her at the bottom of a well (of a well)
Well I told here I was tryin' to break a spell (break a spell)
But I can't get by, my hands are tied
Don't know why I ever got her to try myself
Cause I can't get by, my hands are tied

Oh woman, oh why, why, why, why?
What have I done?
Oh woman, oh where, where, where, where, where
Did you get that gun?

Oh, what have you done?
Woman, what have you done?

Well, I am fed up with you lying cheating ways (cheating ways)
But I get up every morning and every day (every day)
But I can't get by, my hands are tied
Don't why I want her to try myself
'Cause I can't get by, my hands are tied

Oh woman, oh why, why, why, why?
What have I done?
Oh woman, oh where, where, where, where, where
Did you get that gun?

Woman, what have I done?
What have you done?
What have I done?
