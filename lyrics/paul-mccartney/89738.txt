Last Night You Helped Me Through,
Took Me To The Lovers Zone
I Saw There, Images
Projected On A Wall Of Stone
I Stood Inside Egyptian Temples,
I Looked Into Eternal Gardens,
Lay On The Shores Of Distant Islands,
Listening To The Sea Birds Song Of Joy.


Oh, I Owe It All To You,
You Make Me Happy,
Oh, I Owe It All To You.

Late Last Night, We Were Right
Into Some Exotic Scene.
Everywhere, Images
Appearing On A Giant Screen.
I Stood Inside A Glass Cathedral,
I Looked Into The Golden Canyon,
Lay By The Lakes Of Holy Water
Glistening Like A Diamond In The Light.

Oh, I Owe It All To You,
You Make Me Happy,
Oh, I Owe It All To You.
