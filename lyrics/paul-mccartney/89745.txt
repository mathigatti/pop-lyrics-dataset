Well we're going to, yeah we're going to
Get it right this time
We're going to really going to
Raise it to the sky
People are ready to forgive a few mistakes
But let's get started, form a party
Don't you know how long it takes!


C'mon people let the fun begin
We've got a future and it's rushing in
Call all the minstrels from the ancient shrine
Pass down the message that it's right this time

Well I'm trying to, yeah I'm crying to
Lay it on the line
We're trying to, really dying to
Get it right this time
So many yearning for the way it's gonna be
Believe it when you see it happening to you
You know it's real

C'mon people let the world begin
We've got a future and it's charging in
We'll make the best of all we have, and more
We'll do what never has been done before
Oh, yeah

Well I'm going to, yeah I'm going to
Get it right this time
I'm going to, really going to
Raise it to the sky
I must admit I may have made a few mistakes
But let's get started, from a party
Don't you know how long it takes!

So c'mon people let the fun begin
We've got a future and it's rushing in
Call all the minstrels from the ancient shrine
Pass down the message that it's right this time
Oh, yeah

C'mon people let the world begin
We've got a future and it's charging in

Now c'mon people
