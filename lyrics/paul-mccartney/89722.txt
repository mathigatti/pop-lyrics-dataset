O Father, you have given

Those in your care.

FULL CHORUS (mourners)
(Ah)
O Father, you have given
Time to your children.
You will look after
Those in your care.
Into the future,
In ever-growing circles,
You will be there.

CHIEF MOURNER
And your spirit will keep us moving
In the right direction.

SHANTY
Hey, wait a minute.
You didn't tell me.
I fell into a place
I didn't wanna go.
It doesn't matter.
I swear
I'll never go through another of those things
In my life.

You should have warned me Of all the dangers.
But maybe there were some things you just didn't know.
But you're my father,
And surely fathers ought to know about most things
In this life.
Don't tell me.
I thought you were the best.
You were only human
And a lot like all the rest.

Like me you were fragile.
Not secure
With the fast tide of life
That would speed past your door.

CHORUS (mourners)
Father, Father, Father.

BOYS and CHORUS
Toti mundo nati.

CHORUS
Father.
(Ah)

SHANTY
I forgive you,
Will you forgive me?

CHIEF MOURNER
You will be there.

CHIEF MOURNER and CHORUS
And your spirit will keep us moving
In the right direction.
