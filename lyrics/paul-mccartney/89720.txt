BOYS
We're here in school today to get a perfect education,
Yes, we're going up.
We're keen to learn the rules and laws that civilization taught us
Yes, we're growing up.
Not for ourselves, B
but for the whole world were we born.
And we were born in Liverpool.


Our teachers say that ignorance will always drag us down,
It's like a nagging cough.

SHANTY (thrown away)
But I can say that looking back,
The most important thing I found was sagging off!
Not for the whole world.
But for yourself were you born.
And you were...

SHANTY and BOYS
Born in Liverpool.

BOYS
Not Birmingham
Nor Edinburgh.
Not Manchester
Or Sunderland.

SHANTY
Being born where you were born
Carries with it certain responsibilities.

BOYS
This school is good for us.

SHANTY
This school is only good for those
Who want to learn from books.

You'll lose your sense of purpose...

BOYS
But we dare not answer back,
We're scared of teacher's looks.
Not for ourselves,
But for the whole world were we born.
And we were born in Liverpool.

SHANTY
Not Coventry

HEADMASTER
Or Solihull.

BOYS
Not Scarborough

SHANTY
Nor Inverness.
Being born where you were born
Carries with it certain responsibilities.

HEADMASTER
Walk in single file out of the classroom,
Down the stairs and into the playground.

BOYS
Through the school gates,
Cross the road, and over the cemetery fence,
Down the hill to where the grave-stones
Lie inviting in the sun.

Settle down.
Settle down.
Let the afternoon slip by.
Settle down.
Settle down.
It's the perfect place for a kip.

(Shanty falls asleep on a grave-stone and dreams)

SHANTY

Kept in confusion,
Trapped by illusion,
Thinking of speaking my mind.
Dreams of the future,
Ghosts of the past left behind.

Constantly drifting,
Endlessly lifting
More weight than one man can bear.
Into the future,
Ghosts of the past everywhere.

MEN'S CHORUS (ghosts)
You're sleeping amongst us,
We're in your dream,
Who are you?
Why call us?

What does this mean?
Disturbing our slumber,
You move so fast.

SHANTY
Ghosts of the past.
Tossing and turning,
Somehow I'm learning
Secrets I'd rather not know.
Can't it be simple?
Why does it have to be so?

MARY DEE (as ghost)
I ll always be here,
I ll never leave you,
I ll always be in your mind.
Dreams of the future,
Ghosts that the past left behind.

WOMEN S CHORUS (Ghosts)
You re sleeping amongst us.
We re in your dream.
Who are you?
Why call us?
What does this mean?

FULL CHORUS (ghosts)
Disturbing our slumber,
You move so fast.

SHANTY and MARY DEE (as ghost)
Ghosts of the past.

(later, back in school)

HEADMASTER
Boys, this is your teacher.
Her name is Miss Inkley.
She will reach you Spanish.
She was in the war
Fighting with the troops.
You may call her Sir!

BOYS
SIR?

MISS INKLEY
First of all today
You will learn a song
In a foreign tongue.
You will follow me
As I say the words.
We will now begin...
