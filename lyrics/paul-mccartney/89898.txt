My baby, she comes out at night,
she's takin' me by surprise,
She's my baby.


Like gravy, down to the last drop,
I keep mopping her up
Oh yeah, she's my baby.

She's my baby in the morning time,
when the sleep is in her eyes,
and the world is waking up,
she has a rhythm,
oh believe me, I ain't lyin';
She's a woman.

She's a lady in the evening time,
when the stars are in the sky,
that's the time she changes back into a kitten,
oh believe me, I ain't lyin'.

She's my baby.
She's my baby in the morning time,
when the sleep is in her eyes,
and the world is waking up,
she has a rhythm,
oh believe me, I ain't lyin';
She's a woman.

She's a lady in the evening tiem,
when the stars are in the sky,
that's the time she changes back into a kitten,
oh believe me, I ain't lyin'.

Ooh, like gravy,
sown to the last drop,
I keep moppin' it up,
moppin' it up, yeah,
She's my baby...
