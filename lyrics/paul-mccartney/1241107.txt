When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now
Ev'ry little thing she does
She does for me, yeh
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oh
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes, I know that she loves me, now
There is one thing I am sure of
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die
Ev'ry little thing she does
She does for me, yeh
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oh
Ev'ry little thing she does
She does for me, yeh
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oh
