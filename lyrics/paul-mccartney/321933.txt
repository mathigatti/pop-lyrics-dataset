If you love me, won't you call me
I've been waiting, waiting to long
In my soul is, constant yearning
Always singing, singing this song


Only love is strong enough, to take it on the chin
When did I begin, to fall

Anyway, Anyway, you can make, that call
You feel free, to make yourself, at home - woh-oh, ahhhhhh, ohhhhh

If we could be, closer longer
That would help me, help me so much
We can cure eachother's sorrow
Won't you please, please, please get in touch

If our love is strong enough, it may never end
Why would I pretend, to fall, woo-ew

Anyway, Anyway, you can make, that call
You feel free, to make yourself, at home - woh-oh, ahhhhhh

Anyway, Anyway, Anyway, at all
Anyway, you can make that call
