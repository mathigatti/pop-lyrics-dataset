You've got to give a little, take a little,
And let your poor heart break a little.
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.
You've got to laugh a little, cry a little,
Until the clouds roll by a little.
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.


As long as there's the two of us,
We've got the world and all it's charms.
And when the world is through with us,
We've got each other's arms.
You've got to win a little, lose a little,
Yes, and always have the blues a little.
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.

That's the story of, that's the glory of,
That's the story of, that's the glory of,
That's the story of,
That's the glory of love
