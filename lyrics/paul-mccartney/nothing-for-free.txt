Okay, okay, okay

I wonder why you're coming to me
I think you must want something for free
I try to work out what I could say
But my brain's not working today


I know you need something
You were talking to me
You were talking to me

I know you need something
Well, what can it be?
Well, what can it be?

I know you need something
You're talking to me
But you don't get nothing for free

Okay, okay, okay
(Nothing's for free)

You've got a real cool way about you
Is there a lot you want me to do? (yeah)
I'd love to help out in any way
But my brain stopped working today

I know you need something
You were talking to me
You were talking to me

I know you need something
Well, what can it be?
Well, what can it be?

I know you need something
You're talking to me
But you don't get nothing for free

I want to tell you what it means to me
I love you every way and now, and now
But I can't make up my mi-mi-mind

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

I wonder why you're coming to me
I think you must want something for free
I'd love to help out in any way
But-but my brain stopped working today

I know you need something
You were talking to me
You were talking to me

I know you need something
Well, what can it be?
Well, what can it be?

I know you need something
You're talking to me
But you don't get nothing for free

Okay, okay, okay

My brain stopped working
My brain stopped working
My brain stopped working today
