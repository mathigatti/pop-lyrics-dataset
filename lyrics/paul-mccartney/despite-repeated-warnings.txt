Despite repeated warnings
Of dangers up ahead
The captain won't be listening
To what's been said


It feels that there's a good chance
That we have been misled
And so the captain's planning
To steam ahead

What can we do, what can we do
What can we do to stop this foolish plan going through
What can we do, what can we do
This man is bound to lose his ship and his crew

Despite repeated warnings
From those who ought to know
He's got his own agenda and so he'll go

Those who shout the loudest
May not always be the smartest
But they have their proudest moments
Right before they fall

Red sky in the morning
Doesn't ever seem to phase him
But a sailor's warning signal
Should concern us all

How can we stop him
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it
We can save the day

The engineer lives with
His wife and daughter Janet
But he misses them so

Although he's working with
The best crew on the planet
They never want him to go

He had a premonition
He senses something's wrong
And by his own admission
He knew it all along
The captain's crazy
But he doesn't let them know it
He'll take us with him
If we don't do something
Soon to slow it

How can we stop him
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it
We can save the day

Below decks the engineer cries
The captain's gonna leave us when the temperatures rise
The needle's going up
The engine's gonna blow
And we're gonna be left down below
Down below

Yes we can do it
Yes we can do it now
Yes we can do it

Yes we can do it
Yes we can do it now
Yes we can do it
Yes we can do it now
Yes we can do it
Yes we can do it now

If life would work out
The way you plan it
That'd be so fine
For the wife and Janet
Sometimes you might
Have to battle through it
But that's the way you learn
How you've got to do it

Yes we can do it whoa, whoa
Yes we can do it whoa, whoa
Yes we can do it whoa, whoa
Yes we can do it whoa, whoa

Despite repeated warnings
Of dangers up ahead
Well the captain wasn't listening
To what was said

So we went to the captain
And we told him to turn around
But he laughs in our faces
Says that we are mistaken

So we gather around him
Now the ropes that have bound him
Prove that he should have listened
To the will of the people
It's the will of the people
It's the will of the people
