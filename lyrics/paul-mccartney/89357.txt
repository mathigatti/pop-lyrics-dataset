I Have No Answer For You Little Lamb
I Can Help You Out
But I Cannot Help You In
Sometimes You Think That Life Is Hard
And This Is Only One Of Them
My Heart Is Breaking For You Little Lamb
I Can Help You Out
But We May Never Meet Again


La La La La La La La La ... Etc.

Dragonfly Fly By My Window
You And I Still Have A Way To Go
Don't Know Why You Hang Around My Door
I Don't Live Here Any More
Since You Ve Gone I Never Know
I Go On, But I Miss You So

Dragonfly Don't Keep Me Waiting
I'm Waiting Can't You See Me I'm Waiting
When We Try We'll Have A Way To Go
Dragonfly You've Been Away Too Long
How Did Two Rights Make A Wrong
Since You've Gone I Never Know I Go On
But I Miss You So In My Heart
I Feel The Pain
Keeps Coming Back Again

Dragonfly Fly By My Window
I'm Flying Can't You See Me I'm Flying
You And I Can Find A Way To See
Dragonfly The Years Ahead Will Show
How Little We Really Know
Since You've Gone Its Never Right They Go On
The Lonely Nights, Come On Home
And Make It Right

My Heart Is Aching For You Little Lamb
I Can Help You Out
But I Cannot Help You In

La La La La La La La La ... Etc.
