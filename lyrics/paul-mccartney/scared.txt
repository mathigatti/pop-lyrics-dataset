I'm scared to say I love you
Afraid to let you know
That the simplest of words
Won't come out of my mouth
Though I'm dying to let them go
Trying to let you know


I have to say I'm sorry
Don't feel sad for me
But the beautiful birds
Won't fly out of their cage
Though I'm trying to set them free
Trying to let you see
How much you mean to me

I remember the first time we met
Tears in our eyes reflecting
Something connecting from so long ago
It might have been told in the stars
Maybe that's what is was
It doesn't matter because

I'm still too scared to tell you
Afraid to let you see
That the simplest of words
Wont' come out of my mouth
Though I'm dying to set them free
Trying to let you see
How much it means to me
How much you mean to me
How much you mean to me now
