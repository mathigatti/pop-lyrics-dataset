And so it was that you were born
Into this world one winter morning,
With a childish innocence you smiled at me
And I was born again.

God is good
And He will be our savior,
All we need
Is in His power to give us.
Let the light that lies within
His heart
Illuminate our being.

God is good
And with this thought to guide us
We will live

Illuminate your being.

PREACHER
What people want is a family life,
The strength of a home and a moat round the castle.
Pull up the drawbridge,
Staying at home with the family.

All people want is a family life,
Sometimes they find that it isn't so easy.
People can argue,
Life can be hard on a family.

With the music they play all night.

Nothing replaces the love and affection.

Don't be dismayed if it's like that.

Like that.
