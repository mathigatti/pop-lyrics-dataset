Looking like a rag doll 
Mama's little girl 
Singing like a skylark 
Mama's little girl 
Better give me some time for this heart of mine 
Cause I just can't take it all in 
Still I will remember 
Mama's little girl 


Ohhhh Mama's little girl, little girl 
Mama's little girl, little girl 

Looking like a rosebud 
Mama's little girl 
Pickin' up a mountain 
Mama's little girl 
Better give me some time for this heart of mine 
Cause I just can't take it all in 
Still we will remember 
Mama's little girl 

Ohhhh Mama's little girl, little girl 
Mama's little girl 

Looking like a rag doll 
Singing like a skylark 
Growing like a rosebud 
Pickin' up a mountain 
Mama's little girl 
Mama's little girl 

Better give me some time for this heart of mine 
Cause I just can't take it all in 
Still I will remember 
Mama's little girl 
Still we will remember 
Mama's little girl 
Still we will remember 
Mama's little girl 

Ohhhh Mama's little girl, little girl 
Mama's little girl, little girl 
Mama's little girl
