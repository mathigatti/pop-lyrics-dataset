Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jackfrost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos


Everybody knows
Some holly and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeers really know how to fly
And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids, from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry christmas to you

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids, from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry christmas
Merry christmas
Merry christmas
To you
