When you're fed up shedding too many tears
And you're memories seem like just so many souvenirs
I will come to you to ease the pain


If you want me tell me now
If I can be of any help, tell me how
Let me love you like a friend
Everything is gonna come right in the end

When you're crying like a poor little child
And you're feeling like you never could be reconciled
Don't forget a word of what I'm saying

If you want me tell me now
If I can be of any help, tell me how
Let me love you like a friend
Everything is is gonna come right in the end

Well, I can hold you too tight
I could never let you go
But that wouldn't be right
So, why don't you let me know (let me know)

Everybody's got a handful of fear
But tomorrow it may only be a souvenir
Of the way it was 'til it went away

If you want me tell me now
If I can be of any help, tell me how
Let me love you like a friend
Every little thing is gonna come right in the end

Well, I can hold you too tight
I could never let you go
But that wouldn't be right
So, why don't you let me know (let me know)

If you want me tell me now
If I can be of any help, tell me how
Let me love you like a friend
Every little thing is gonna come right in the end

Souvenir
No, not another souvenir
No, no no, no, souvenir
