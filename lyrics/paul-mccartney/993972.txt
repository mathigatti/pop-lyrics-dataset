I'm not coming down
No matter what you
I like it up here without you


Go light, Mr. Bellamy
We'll have you down soon

No one to tell me what to do
No one to hold my hand
Bellamy's got a lot to do
And I hope that you'll understand

Nobody here to spoil the view
Interfere with my plans
Bellamy's got a job to do
And he's hoping you'll understand

Steady, Lads
And Easy Does It
Ooooh, don't frighten him!
Here we go...

I'm not coming down
No matter what say
I like it up here anyway

Sit tight, Mr. Bellamy
This shouldn't take long

In the delusionary state
No wonder he's been feeling strange of late
In the delusionary state
No wonder he's been feeling strange of late

Nobody here to spoil the view
Interfere with my plans
Bellamy's got a job to do
And he's hoping you'll understand

Steady, Lads
And Easy Does It
Don't frighten him!
Here we go...
Here we go...

I'm not coming down
No matter what you
I like it up here without you

Come down, come down to me [4x]
