I laughed at the teachers
Who taught in my school
They kept one arm bandits
In the swimming pool
They don't understand me
But they never will
And if was there
I'd be telling them still
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I followed the leader
Into her tent
But nobody told me that she owed some rent
She wanted to love me, I wanted to go
But she taught me things that I needed to know
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
She wanted to love me, I wanted to go
Well she taught me things that I needed to know
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I talked to my lawer, he picked up my bail
Won't someone get me out of this lousy jail
We're both in agreement that grime never pays
And I should be out in a couple of days
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
