That Would Be Something
Really would be something
That Would Be Something
To meet you in the fallin' rain momma
To meet you in the fallin' rain


Meet you in the fallin' rain
Meet you in the fallin' rain

Every Night

Every Night I Just Wanna Go Out, Get Out Of My Head
Every Day I Don't Want To Get Up, Get Out Of My Bed
Every Night I Want To Play Out
And Every Day I Want To Do ooh ooh oh oh
But Tonight I Just Want To Stay In
And Be With You,
And Be With You.

Ooh
Ooh
Believe Me Mama
Every Day I Lean On A Lamp Post, I'm Wasting My Time
Every Day I Lay On A Pillow, I'm Resting My Mind
Every Morning Brings A New Day
Every Night That Day Is Through ooh ooh oh oh
But Tonight I Just Want To Stay In
And Be With You,
And Be With You.
Ooh
Ooh
Believe Me Mama ooh
Ooh
