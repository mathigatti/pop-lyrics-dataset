How kind of you to think of me
When I was out of sorts
It really meant alot to be
In someone else's thoughts
Someone else's mind
Someone else as kind, as you


The thoughtfulness you showed has made
A difference in my life
I won't forget how unafraid
You were that long dark night

I thought that all was lost
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind, as you

I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there, for me

How kind of you to stick by me
During the final bout
And listened to the referee
As I was counted out

I thought my time was up
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind, as you

I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there for me

How kind of you to think of me
How kind of you...
