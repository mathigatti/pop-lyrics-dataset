Welcome to our island,
Glad you came to call,
Now you've made yourself at home,
You're welcome to us all
We are simple people, why are we this way,
This is what we always say.


[Chorus:]
It's the way that we bong on the bongo
It's the way that be bang on the big base drum,
It's the way we sing in the song book,
Plays the tropic island hum
Hum, hum...

Playin' in the sunshine, lots of sea and sand
Its jolly nice in paradise
Lordie ain't life grand
Everyone was happy joining in the fun,
Doing like we've always done

It's the way that we shake on the shakers,
It's the way that we bang on the big base drum,
It's the way that we bake in the cake off,
Plays the tropic island hum

[Chorus]

Good, good, good... Feeling good
Tonights a special night Feeling good,
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Anything can happen in the meantime
Won't you come and celebrate our tropic island hum

[Chorus 2x]
