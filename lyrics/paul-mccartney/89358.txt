Single pigeon through the railing
Did she throw you out
Sunday morning fight about saturday night


Single seagull gliding over regent's park canal
Do you need a pal for a minute or two
You do?
Me too, me too, me too
I'm a lot like you
Me too, me too, me too
I'm a lot like you

Did she! Turf you out in the cold morning rain again
Me too, me too, me too
I'm a lot like you
Me too, me too, me too
I'm a lot like you

Sunday morning fight about saturday night
