Now you don't wanna be the little woman
No you don't want to be the little woman
I love. No, no, no, no. I love.
Now you don't wanna stay in my school
You don't wanna be the one that's cool.
You don't wanna be the little woman I love.
You're up all night and we can let it hang out right. (Yeah!)
I said good-bye to all my expectations the day you walked out of my life.


Winter time is coming now
Gimme a sign if you can somehow.
Make it clear where you're heading for
Will I see you someday at my door?
Taking it all into consideration
Love's a game I never win.
I've been in very similar situations,
Again and again and again.

Oh, no. Now you don't wanna be the little woman
No, you don't want to be the little woman
I love. No, no, no, no. I love.
Now you don't wanna stay in my home
You just wanna be on your own.
You don't wanna be the little woman I love.
Take it away!

Ah, yeah!
Well things were fine all the summer long
Then things changed, so where did we go wrong?
We can run but we cannot hide
In the greener grass on the other side.
Taking it all into consideraton,
Love's a game I never win.
I've been in very similar situations,
Again and again and again.
