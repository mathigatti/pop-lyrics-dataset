But moving and a grooving gonna satisfy my soul.

I've never kissed a bear, I've never kissed a goon,
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room.

Let's buy some more, let's have party tonight.

Some people like to rock, some people like to roll,
But moving and a grooving gonna satisfy my soul.
