At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy road
Who can handle such a heavy load?


At the mercy, At the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
We can think of nothing more to say

If you show me love, I won't refuse
I know you'd never make me choose
Between the love I've got and the love I'd lose

Sometimes I'd rather run and hide
Then stay and face the fear inside

At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
Who can bear to turn their head away?

At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy road
We can watch the universe explode

If you take me up, I won't say no
I guess you'd rather see me grow
Into a better man than the one you know

Sometimes my head is hanging low
It's time to get on with the show

At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
I can think of nothing more to say
