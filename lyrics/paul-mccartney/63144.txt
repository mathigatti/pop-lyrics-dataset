Speed along the highway, honey I want it my way 
But listen to her daddy's song, don't stay out to long 
Were just busy hidin', sitting the back seat of my car 


The lazy lights are pretty, we end up in Mexico City 
But listen to her daddy's song, makin' love is wrong 
Were just busy ridin', sitting the back seat of my car 

Oh we was only busy hidin', sitting the back seat of my car 
And when we've finshed drivin' we can say we were late inarriving 
and listen to her daddy's song, we believe that we can't be wrong
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 

We can make it to Mexico City, sittin' in the backseat of my car

Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
NO NO NO NO 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong
