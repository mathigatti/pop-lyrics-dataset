I sat around all day
I used to get stoned
I liked to get wasted
But these days I don’t
‘Cos I’m happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah


I walked around angry
I used to feel bad
But nowadays my days
Don’t have to be sad
‘Cos I’m happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah

Like hear the high clear robin sing
Walk a bluebell carpet
Watch the children playing games
Catch a moon and drop it
Hear the gentle mantle roll
On a frosty morning
See the mighty ocean break
Like a sailor’s warning

I used to drink too much
Forgot to come home
I lied to my doctor
But these days I don’t
‘Cos I’m happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah

Throw a pocketful of coins in the Trevi fountain
See an ice cold running stream
Rushing down the mountain
Hear a new born baby lamb
Calling for its mother
Watching reunited friends
Loving one another

I sat around all day
I liked to get stoned
I used to get wasted
But these days I don’t
'Cos I’m happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah

Happy with you
I’m happy with you
Happy with you
