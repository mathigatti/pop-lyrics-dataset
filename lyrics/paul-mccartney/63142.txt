I look high, I look low
I'm lookin' everywhere I go
Lookin' for a home
In the heart of the country


I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
Lookin' for a home
In the heart of the country

Heart of the country
Where the holy people grow
Heart of the country
Smell the grass in the meadow

Want horse, I want sheep
I want to get me a good night's sleep
Livin' in a home
In the heart of the country

I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
Livin' in a home
In the heart of the country

Heart of the country
Where the holy people grow
Heart of the country
Smell the grass in the meadow
