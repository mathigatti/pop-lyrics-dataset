I thought I saw your shadow, in an old doorway 
           but when I looked again, I thought I made a big mistake 


           It was someone else, who looked a little like you 
           But now I know, how ha ain't no-one like you (I'll tell you why I know baby) 

               Cause I'm looking for you, lookin for you, yeah I'm lookin for you 
               That's all I do, that's all 
               I'm looking for you, lookin for you, yeah I'm lookin for you, that's right 
               That's all I do yeah, ha ha 
 
           I've been to many places, around the world 
           I've studied many faces, of every little boy and girl 

               But I'm looking for you, I'm lookin for you, just lookin for you 
               Babe I'm looking for you, lookin for you, look look lookin for you 

           Hey now now now, let me tell yeah baby, the other things in life 
           Finally made a decision, that's outta sight 

           But now I know, there's only one place to be 
           You know where that place is, if for you, to be with me 

               Babe I'm looking for you, lookin for you, I'm lookin for you 
               I'm looking for you, lookin for you, yeah I'm lookin for you 
               Tell me I'm a lookin for you, through and through, um I'm lookin for you 
               Baby I'm looking for you, everything's true, cause I'm gonna look for you 
               I'm looking for you, lookin for you, etc.
