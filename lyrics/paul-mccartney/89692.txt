Together we can make it happen,
together we can make it stick.

Together, (together) we can make it happen,
together we can make it stick.
(Together we can make it happen, together)
I learn something special, special every day.
I learn something special every day.
(Together we can make it happen, together)
Learn something hard, learn something fast,
and I learn to find my way.

Together we can make it happen,
together we can make it stick.
