Some folks say 'oobu'
Some folks say 'joobu'
But I say 'oobu joobu' mama
(Wide screen radio!)


Oobu! (Oobu!)
Joobu! (Joobu!)
Oobu! (Oobu!)
Joobu! (Joobu!)
Oobu! (Oobu!)
Joobu! (Joobu!)

Joobu, oobu
A-joobu, oobu
A-joobu, oobu
A-joobu, oobu
A-joobu

Cracks in the pavement, cracks in the road
Cracks in the ceiling where the bathtube overflowed
Overflowed
Holes in the gutters, holes in the slate
Holes in the carpet, but I won't evacuate

I love this house, it's where I'll stay
Eat and sleep the night and day
I love this house, it's where I'll be
For you to spend some time with me
I love this house

Damp in the basement, damp in the hall
Damp in the living room that's climbing up the wall
Up the wall
Rust in the drainpipe, rust in the spout
Rust in the radiators still won't get me out

I love this house, it's where I'll stay
Eat and sleep the night and day
I love this house, it's where I'll be
For you to spend some time with me
I love this house

Hot in the summer
Rattling windows, teeth and knees
Perfect place for cat and mouse
But never mind, I love this house
Ow!

Cracks in the pavement, cracks in the road
Cracks in the ceiling where the bathtub overflowed
Holes in the gutters, holes in the slate
Holes in the carpet, but I won't evacuate

I love this house, it's where I'll stay
To eat and sleep the night and day
I love this house, it's where I'll be
For you to spend some time with me
I love this house
