I like it
Please don't take my heart away
It's happy
Where it is so let it stay
You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way


I've seen it
Shining from the furthest stars
Like Venus
Saw it on the way to Mars
You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way

Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight

I like it
Please don't take my heart away
It's happy
Where it is so let it stay
You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way

Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight

Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight

You gave me love your way
