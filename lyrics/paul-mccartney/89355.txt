And Your World Is As Kind As A Penny
Oh.... And You Knew It All Along
You Did The Right Thing

And It Can Happen To You


All At Once You Get Sound In Your Ears
And Your Cloud Disappears Into Yellow

Well You Knew It All Along
Get On The Right Thing
Believe Me Its So
Because I Happen To Know
Try A Little Love, You Can't Go Wrong

Get On The Right Thing (Repeat Twice)
My Little Love You Cant Go Wrong
Get On The Right Thing
Get On The Right Thing
Get On Tee Right Thing Do
Get On The Right Thing You

All At Once We See Things In Our Skies
And We Both Realize It Together
Well You Know They Were Wrong
Get On The Right Thing
Yes You Knew It All Along
Get On The Right Thing
Believe Me Its So
Because I Happen To Know
You Can't Go Wrong

Get On The Right Thing, Get On The Right Thing,

You Can't Go Wrong Get On The Right Thing
And Try A Little Love
And It Can't Go Wrong

Try A Little Love, You Can't Go Wrong
