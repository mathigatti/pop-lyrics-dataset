I used to be bad
But I don't have to be bad no more
Yeah, I used to be bad
But I don't have to be bad no more
Well ain't no doubt about it, people
It's something you can't ignore


Well, I ain't good looking
People, you know I've been up on a shelf
Yes, I know I ain't good looking
And I've been put up on the shelf
But I got a sweet disposition
I like to enjoy myself

I used to be bad
But I don't have to be bad no more
Yeah, I used to be bad
But I don't have to be bad no more
You know I learned my lesson
A long, long time ago

Well, no matter what you say
No matter what you do
You got one life to live
It's gonna come back home to you
I used to be bad
But I don't have to be bad no more
You know I learned my lesson
A long, long time ago

The good Lord made this world
And everything that's in it
The way I see it, baby
You got to love it to the limit
Oh yes, now people
It's something you can't ignore
Yes I used to be bad
But I ain't gonna be bad no more

Well, the way you treat me darling
Made me understand
Never quit you baby
I'm gonna love you to the end
Yeah, I used to be bad
But I ain't gonna be bad no more
Yes, I learned my lesson
A long, long time ago

Yes, I learned my lesson
A long, long time ago
Yes, I learned my lesson
You're gonna reap just what you sow
