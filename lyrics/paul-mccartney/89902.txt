1,2,3,4,5, let's go for a drive
6,7,8,9,10, let's go there and back again


Something's open it's my heart
If something's missing it's when we're apart
If something's good it's when we're back together again

Nothing's wrong it's just insane
Nothing's right until you're back again
Nothing's broken when it's softly spoken
And we're walking slowly down the lane

Why don't we drive in the rain?
Straight to the eye of the hurricane
Go for a ride in the driving rain

1,2,3,4,5 let's go for a drive
6,7,8,9,10, Ooh ooh
1,2,3,4,5, let's go for a drive
6,7,8,9,10 let's go there and back again
Baby, baby

You come walking through my door
Like the one that I've been waiting for
Letting sunshine in the darkest places when I've been going there again

So why don't we drive in the rain
Straight to the eye of the hurricane

Why don't we drive in the rain
Straight to the eye of the hurricane
Go for a ride in the driving rain
1,2,3,4,5 let's go for a drive
6,7,8,9,10 Ooh ooh
1,2,3,4,5 let's go for a drive
6,7,8,9,10 let's go there and back again
Baby, baby

In the driving rain
Why don't we drive
In the driving rain

1,2,3,4,5 Ooh ooh
6,7,8,9,10 Let's go back again
1,2,3,4,5 let's go for a drive
6,7,8,9,10 let's go there and back again

You come walking through my door
