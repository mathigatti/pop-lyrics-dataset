The chef prepares a special menu
For your delight oh my
Tonight you fly so high up
In the vanilla sky


Your life is fine
It's sweet and sour
Unbearable or great
You gotta love every hour
You must appreciate

This is your time
This is your day
You've got it all
Don't blow it away

The chef prepares a special menu
For your delight oh my
Tonight you fly so high up
In the vanilla sky

Melted tea leaves cast your fortune
In a glass of wine
Snail or fish
Balloon or dolphin
See the silver shine

This is your time
This is your day
You've got it all
Don't blow it away
The chef prepares a special menu
For your delight oh my
Tonight you fly so high up
In the vanilla sky
