Well you know I'll always love you
But it would have been a lie
If I said that I could please you
Every moment that I try


Wouldn't want to see you crying
So l hope you don't mind
The things I say
On the way

Well we've been traveling for a long time
And we finally finished here
Though I said some things to hurt you
Well it was only out of fear

Wouldn't want to see you crying
So l hope you don't mind
The things I say
On the way

Well you know I'll always love you
Everything will be alright
If I know you don't mind
The things I say
On the way

Well you know I'll always love you
Everything will be ok
If I know you don't mind
The things I say
On the way
