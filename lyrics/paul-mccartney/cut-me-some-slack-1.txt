Dear mama, set me free
Hey mama, let me be
Mama, watch me run
Mama, i wanna have some fun (yeah)


Hey mama, let me down
Mama i want to go to town

If you want me to stick around
I want to give em some slack
I’m gonna hear
The woman yet never come back

If you want me to stick around you’ve got to cut me some slack
I want to hear the woman yet never come back

Wooo, wooo, wooo, woo

Mama, let me be
Mama set me free
Mama watch me run
Mama watch me run
Oh, set me free
Set me free
Set me free
