Say, say, say what you want
But don't play games with my affection
Take, take, take what you need
But don't leave me with no direction


All alone, I site home by the phone
Waiting for you, baby (baby)
Through the years how can you stand to hear
My pleading for you, dear?
You know I'm crying
oo-oo-oo-oo-oo, yeah, yeah

Now, go, go go where you want
But don't leave me here forever
You, you, you stay away
So long, dear, I see you never

What can I do, girl, to get through you?
'Cause I love you, baby (baby)
Standing here, baptised in all my tears
Baby, through the years
You know I'm crying
oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

EE-EE-EE.

You got to say, say, say
Got to say, say, say

You never ever worry
And you never shed a tear
You're saying that my love ain't real
Just look at my face, these tears ain't drying

You, you, you can never say
That I'm not the one who really loves you
I pray, pray, pray every day
That you'll see things, girl, like I do

What can I do, girl, to get through you?
'Cause I love you, (love you), baby, (baby)
Standign here, baptised in all my tears,
baby, through the years
You know I'm crying
oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

EE-EE-EE.
