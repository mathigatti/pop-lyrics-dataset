So let's get started
I’m ready to be heard
Before the dear departed
Can have the final word


In a perfect situation
I'd have told you long ago
But now I think it's time
You ought to know

So let me tell you
Right here and now
I’m gonna love you
And I will tell you how

I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my word
And we'll get started now

You're not expected
To stand on hallowed ground
But know you'll be protected
As long as I'm around

To ensure there's no confusion
I would like to make it clear
If you need my help
I promise I’ll be here

So let me tell you
Right here and now
I’m gonna love you
And I will tell you how

I'll give you my heart
I’ll give you my word
And we'll get started now

Get started, let's get started, now
Get started, started, yeah
Get started now, yeah, yeah
Get started yeah
Oh, let's get started, yeah
Get start, don’t, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't start it now
Yeah, get started
