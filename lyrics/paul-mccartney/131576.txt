You gave me the answer to love eternally
I love you and
You, you seem to like me
Wherever we wander
The local folk agree
I love you and you
You seem to like me


Heading back to old familiar places
Places where the cobwebs blow away
I can forget the airs and graces

You'll never be crowned by the aristocracy
To their delight, you'd merely invite them in for a cup of tea

And I love you and
You, you seem to like
You seem to like
You seem to like me.
