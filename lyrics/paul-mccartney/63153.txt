Give Ireland Back To The Irish 
Don't Make Them Have To Take It Away 
Give Ireland Back To The Irish 
Make Ireland Irish Today 


Great Britian You Are Tremendous 
And Nobody Knows Like Me 
But Really What Are You Doin' 
In The Land Across The Sea 

Tell Me How Would You Like It 
If On Your Way To Work 
You Were Stopped By Irish Soliders 
Would You Lie Down Do Nothing 
Would You Give In, or Go Berserk 

Give Ireland Back To The Irish 
Don't Make Them Have To Take It Away 
Give Ireland Back To The Irish 
Make Ireland Irish Today 

Great Britian And All The People 
Say That All People Must Be Free 
Meanwhile Back In Ireland 
There's A Man Who Looks Like Me 

And He Dreams Of God And Country 
And He's Feeling Really Bad 
And He's Sitting In A Prison 
Should He Lie Down Do Nothing 
Should Give In Or Go Mad 

Give Ireland Back To The Irish 
Don't Make Them Have To Take It Away 
Give Ireland Back To The Irish 
Make Ireland Irish Today 

Give Ireland Back To The Irish 
Don't Make Them Have To Take It Away 
Give Ireland Back To The Irish 
Make Ireland Irish Today
