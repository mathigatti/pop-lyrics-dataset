I light a candle to our love
In love our problems disappear
But all in all we soon discover
That one and one is all we long to hear
All 'round the world
Little children being born to the world
Got to give more we can â€˜til the war is won
Then will the work be done


Help them to learn songs of joy instead of
Burn baby burn, let us show them how to play
The pipes of peace, play the pipes of peace
Help me to learn songs of joy instead of
Burn baby burn, won't you show me how to play
The pipes of peace, play the pipes of peace

What do you say? Will the human race
Be run in a day? Or will someone save
This planet we're playing on?
Is it the only one? (what are we going to do?)
Help them to see that the people here
Are like you and me, let us show them how to play
The pipes of peace, the pipes of peace

I light a candle to our love
In love our problems disappear
But all in all we soon discover
That one and one is all we long to hear
