No one else will ever see
How much faith you have in me
Only fools would disagree that it's so
Some people never know


Like a fool I'm faraway
Ev'ry night I hope and pray
I'll be coming home to stay and it's so
Some people never know

Some people can sleep at nightime
Believing that love is a lie
I'm only a person like you, love
And who in the world can be right
All the right time
I know I was wrong, make me right, right

Only love can stand the test
Only you outshine the rest
Only fools take second best, but it's so
Some people never know
