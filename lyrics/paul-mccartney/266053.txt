Can't say
I've found out
I can't tell you
What's all about
Don't know who does
I tell you to
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love


Woh, woh, woh,
No, no, no
I must be wrong, baby, yeah
But I don't believe that he's the one
But if you insist
I must be wrong, I must be wrong
I have to leave
And when I'm gone
I'll leave my message in my song
That's right

Beware, my love
He'll bowl you over
Beware, my love
Before you're much older
He'll sweep you up
Under his carpet
&gt;You'd be in luck
If you could stop it
Come on, now

Well, he'll wear you out
And in a minute
You'll hear a shout
And then you'll be in it

So, so beware my love
'Cause he'll take you under
Beware, my love
The sound of his thunder

I don't believe that he's the one
But if you insist
I must be wrong, I must be wrong
But I have to leave
And when I'm gone
I'll leave my message in my song
That's right I'm gonna leave it

Beware, my love
Don't you know he'll bowl you over
Beware, my love
Before you're much older
Yeah he's gonna wear you out
And in a minute
You'll hear a shout
And then you'll be in it...
Can't say
I've found out
I tell you to
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
