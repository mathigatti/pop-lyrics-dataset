I Lie Around
All Over The Place


It Seems That I Have No Choice In The Matter
Roll Along Wheel Of Fortune
As You Roll Along I Stick Around
Furthermore In The Country
I Will Lay My Burden Down
I Lie Around
I Lie Around
I Lie Around
All Over The Place
All Over The Place
All Over The Place
All Over The Place

Too Long Have I Been The Heart Of The Matter
All Along I Was Only Over Tired And Overtaken
Furthermore In The Country
I Will Lay My Burden Down
I Lie Around
I Lie Around
I Lie Around
All Over The Place

So Long, Bye Bye, It Was Fun While It Mattered
Roll Along Wheel Of Fortune
As You Roll Along I Stick Around
Furthermore In The Country
I Will Lay My Burden Down

Yes, I Lie Around
All Over The Place
All Over The Place
All Over The Place
I Lie Around, Around
