Help! i need somebody
Help! not just anybody
Help! you know i need someone
Help!


When i was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody´s help in any way
And now these days are gone
I´m not so self assured
Now i find i´ve changed my mind
I´ve opened up the doors

Help me if you can i´m feeling down
And i do appreciate you being ´round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won´t you please, please help me?

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then i feel so insecure
I know that i just need you
Like i´ve never done before

Help me if you can i´m feeling down
And i do appreciate you being ´round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won´t you please, please help me?
