What's that you're doing?
Girl I like what you do to me
What's that you're doing?
'Cos it makes no kind of sense to me


You can make me feel so proud
You can make me holler ow!
Girl you make me want to dance and sing
My mind is blown and you're the blame
I say it's sunnin' when there's rain
I jump by leaps and bounds, just call my name

What's that you're saying?
Girl I like the way you talk to me
What's that you're saying?
Even if it's wrong girl I do agree

Girl you make me feel so small
Though I might stand six feet tall
What you've got cuts me right down to size
I'll be the last, you'll be the first
I'll do my best to quench your thirst
I'm the lucky one who keeps the prize

Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
Girl I like what you
Do to me, do to me
Do it some more
Do to me, do to me
Do it some more

What's that you're doing?
Girl I like what you do to me
What's that you're doing?
'Cos it makes no kind of sense to me

You can fill my appetite
Without me taking up a bite
Never knew that love could fill you up
You're much too good for me to pass
I'm for the taking, you just ask
We can make it stick with love and luck

Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
Girl I like what you
Do to me, do to me
Do it some more
You know I like what you're doing
Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more

What's that I'm feeling?
That sensation's such a mystery
I know what it's thrilling
And I hope this feeling lasts eternally

Girl you make me scream and shout
Tell me what it's all about
You make me give in without a fight
I don't have no words to say
You can fill it anyway
And everything you do will turn out alright

Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
She loves you yeah yeah yeah
She loves you yeah yeah yeah yeah
