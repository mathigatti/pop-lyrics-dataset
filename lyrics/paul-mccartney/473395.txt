Well you wake up early in the morning
Hear the ding dong bell
You go a-walkin' to the table
See the same damn thing
Knife and fork out on the table
Piece of paper round my hand
Nothing I can do about it
I'll get in trouble with the man


Let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine his ever-loving light on me

If you ever go to Houston
You better act right
You better not gamble
And you better not fight
Because the Sheriff will arrest you
And he'll carry you down
And if they go and find you guilty
Penitentiary bound

Let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine his ever-loving light on me

Well you wake up early in the morning
Hear the ding dong bell
You go a-walkin' to the table
See the same damn thing
Knife and fork out on the table
Piece of paper in my hand
Nothing I can do about it
I'll get in trouble with the man

Let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine his ever-loving light on me

Well if I ever go to Houston
You better act right
You better not gamble
And you better not fight
Because the Sheriff will arrest you
And they'll carry you down
And if they find you guilty
Well you'll be sugar-line bound

Let the midnight special
Shine his light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine his ever-loving light on me
