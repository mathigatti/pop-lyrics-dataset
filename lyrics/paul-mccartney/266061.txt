Would you care to sit with me
For a cup of English tea
Very twee, very me
Any sunny morning


What a pleasure it would be
Chatting so delightfully
Nanny bakes, fairy cakes
Every Sunday morning

Miles of miles of English garden, stretching past the willow tree
Lines of holly, hocks and roses, listen most attentively

Do you know the game crochet
Peradventure we might play
Very gay, hip hooray
Any sunny morning

(solo)

Miles of miles of English garden, stretching past the willow tree
Lines of holly, hocks and roses, listen most attentively

As a rule the church bells chime
When it's almost supper time
Nanny bakes, fairy cakes
On a Sunday morning
