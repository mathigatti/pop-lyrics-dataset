The world wild applies to the words you and me

While take a walk thru an African park one day
I saw a sign say: The animals have the right of way


Wild life, whatever happened to
Wild life, the animals in the zoo?

We're breathing a lot
a lot of political nonsense in the air

You're making it hard for the people who live in there
You're moving so fast, but, baby, you know not where
Wild life, (wild life), what's gonna happen to
Wild life, (wild life), the animals in the zoo?

You'd better stop, there's animals ev'rywhere
And man is the top, an animal too
And, man, you just got to care

Wild life, what's gonna happen to
Wild life, the animals in the zoo?

You're breathing a lot of polical nonsense in the air

Wild life, (wild life), what's gonna happen to
(what's gonna happen to) (what's gonna happen to)
Wild life, (wild life), the animals in the zoo?
(what's gonna happen to) (what's gonna happen to)
Wild life, what ever happened to?
What ever happened to?
