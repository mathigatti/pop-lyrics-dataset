If I have to run
I'm not runnin' out on you
If I have to shake a little
Sand out of my shoes
I'm runnin' from the law
Or they'll put me inside


Baby, won't you let me have
A little time to hide
Baby, won't you let me have
A little time to hide

I've been on the run
Since the Good Lord knows when
And the day I die
I'll still be runnin' then
Runnin' from the days
When I would lay me down and cry

Baby, won't you let me have
A little time to hide
Baby, won't you let me have
A little time to hide

Will I love you tomorrow?
Yes, I will, my love
Yes, I will, my love
Will I beg, steal or borrow?
Yes, I will, my love
Yes, I will, my love

To spend a little time
Happy to be by your side
Baby, won't you let me have
A little time to hide

Baby, won't you let me have
A little time to hide

If I have to run
I'm not runnin' out on you
If I have to shake a little
Sand out of my shoes
I'm runnin' from the law
Or they'll put me inside

Baby, won't you let me have
A little time to hide
Baby, won't you let me have
A little time to hide
Baby, won't you let me have
A little time
Baby, won't you let me have
A little time
Baby, won't you let me have
A little time to hide
