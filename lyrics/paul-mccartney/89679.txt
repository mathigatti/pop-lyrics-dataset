I can't get over your love
No matter how hard life seems
There's a light in my dreams
Thanks to you


My friends keep asking me why
There's such a smile on my face
There's a home at my place
Thanks to you

I don't want anything from you
Turn on your motor of love

Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
I can't get over your powerful
Motor of love

I can't get over your love
No matter how lost I feel
I know my love is real
Thanks to you

You simply reached out your hand
And touched me deep in my soul
I came in out of the cold
Thanks to you

I won't steal anything from you
You give me more than enough
Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
I can't get over your powerful
Motor of love

There was a time
When I was down and counted out
Well I remember I felt so bad
I nearly threw away
Nearly threw away the keys

Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
I can't get over your powerful
Motor of love
