Somedays I look,
I look at you with eyes that shine.
Somedays I don't,
I don't believe that you are mine.


It's no good asking me what time of day it is,
Who won the match or scored the goal.
Somedays I look,
Somedays I look into your soul.

Sometimes I laugh,
I laugh to think how young we were.
Sometimes it's hard,
It's hard to know which way to turn.

Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall,
How much it cost or what it's worth.
Sometimes I laugh,
I laugh to think how young we were.

We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real.
Inside each one of us is love,
And we know how it feels.

Somedays I cry,
I cry for those who live in fear.
Somedays I don't,
I don't remember why I'm here.

No use reminding me, it's just the way it is,
Who ran the race and came in first.
Somedays I cry,
I cry for those who fear the worst.

We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real.
Inside each one of us is love,
And we know how it feels.

Somedays I look,
I look at you with eyes that shine.
Somedays I don't,
I don't believe that you are mine.

It's no good asking me what time of day it is,
Who won the match or scored the goal.
Somedays I look,
Somedays I look into your soul.
