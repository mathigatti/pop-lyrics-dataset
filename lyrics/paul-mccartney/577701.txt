She's got an american accent
From her head to her toes,
If she's involved in an accident,
You wouldn't see her underclothes.


She is perfectly spotless,
A fact that sticks out a mile.
But people have got more talent
But this little lady's got style.

Style, style,
See her when she's walking.
She's got style, style,
Even when she's making me say
Ooooh-oo
Ooooh hey hey
Ooooh.

She was born on the wrong side
Of these imaginary tracks
That used to divide each other
Into two convenient packs.

She became a survivor
Always armed with a smile
You've only have to look at her picture to know
That this little lady's got style

Style, style,
See her when she's talking
Style, style
Even when she's staying her place

As an only child
In a hostile world
Her only chance
Was to run away
Yeah yeah woh
Ooh

She's got style, style,
See her when she's walking
She's got style, woh, style,
Even when she's talking away.
Oh style, yeah, style,
I see her when she's talking
She's got style, style,
Even when she's staying her place
Oooh, way
Ooh, oh, yeah, ooh, ooh, yeah.
