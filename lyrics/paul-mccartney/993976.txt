That was me, in the scout camp, in the school play
Spade and bucket by the sea, that was me


That was me, playing conkers at the bus stop
On a blanket in the blue bells, that was me

The same me that stands here now
When I think that all this stuff
Can make a life that's pretty hard to take it in, that was me

Well that was me, royal iris, on the river
Mersy beat n' with the band, that was me

Yeah, that was me, sweating cobwebs under contract
In the cellar, on tv, that was me

The same me that stands here now
If fate agreed that all of this
To make a lifetime, who am I to disagree, that was me

That was me, accapella at the alter
In the middle of the picture, that was me

That was me at the party, sweatin' cobwebs
In a cellar on tv ya that was me

The same me that stands here now
When I think that all this stuff
Can make a life that's pretty hard to take it in, that was me
That was me, ya, that was me!
