Crash Bang Wallop I'm A Lover Again
I've Got My Eyes On The Road
And I'm Feeling No Pain
I've Found A Real Fine Woman
I'm Heading To See Her.


Bye Bye Melancholy Listen To Me
We Had A Long Long Ride
But It Isn't To Be
I've Found A Real Fine Woman
I'm Heading To See Her.

Get Out Of My Way
Get Out Of My Life
I Don't Need Anybody To Tell Me
How To Be Right
Don't Try To Stop Me
I've Got The Answer
I Won't Need Anybody Except My Woman Tonight.

I Can't Help It If I'm Starting To Smile
I've Got A Full Gas Tank
And It's Only A Mile
'Till I'll Bee With My Little Woman
I'm Ready To See Her.

So I Say ...
Bye Bye Melancholy Listen To Me
We Had A Long Long Ride
But It Isn't To Be
I've Found A Real Fine Woman
I'm Heading To See Her.

Get Out Of My Way
Get Out Of My Life
I Don't Need Anybody To Tell Me
How To Be Right
Don't Try To Stop Me
I've Got The Answer
I Won't Need Anybody Except My Woman Tonight.
