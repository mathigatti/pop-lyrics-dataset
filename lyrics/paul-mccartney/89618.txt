Hey-yeah,
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


You need love, write a letter,
You need love, write away.
Get it down, you'll feel better,
Send it now, write away.

Hey, cinderella, did you need that other fella?
On the wrong side of midnight your defences slipped away.
You need attention, so I think it's worth a mention,
That if I can deliver,
Well, there wouldn't be no heavy price to pay-ee.

You need love, write a letter,
You need love, write away.
If you need to feel better,
Do it now, write away-ee-ee-ee.

Hey, marguerita, I can think of nothing sweeter,
But the taste of your nectar seems to lead the boys astray.
Don't you forget it, well, you know you won't regret it,
Say, I've got the answer,
You were looking at it long before today-ee.

You need love, (love, love)
Write a letter, (letter)
You need love, (love, love)
Write away.
Get it down, (down, down)
You'll feel better, (better)
Send it now, (now, now)
Write away.

Hey, hey.

You need love, love, love,
Write a letter, (letter)
You need love, (love, love)
Write away.
If you need (need, need)
To feel better, (better)
Do it now, now, now,
Write away
