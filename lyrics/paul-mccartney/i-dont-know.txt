I got crows out my window, dogs at my door
I don't think I can take anymore
What am I doin' wrong? I don't know
My brother told me: Life's not a pain
That was right when it started to rain
Where am I going wrong? I don't know


But it's alright, sleep tight
I will take the strain
You'll find, love of mine
You will feel no pain

Well, I see trouble at every turn
I've got so many lessons to learn
What am I doin' wrong? I don't know
Now what's the matter with me?
Am I right? Am I wrong?
Now I started to see
I must try to be strong
I try to love you best as I can
But you know that I'm only a man
Where am I going wrong? I don't know

But it's alright, sleep tight
I will take the strain
You'll find, little love of mine
You will feel no pain

I got crows at my window and dogs at my door
But I don't think I can take anymore
What am I doin' wrong? I don't know
Now what's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know
What's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know
What's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know
