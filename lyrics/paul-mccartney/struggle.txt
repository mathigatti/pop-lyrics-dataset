Want to get you in my heart again
Want to love you once more
Want to get you in my heart again
Want to get you once more


If you want love
If you want to fight
Doesn't really matter
I want you tonight

Well, well, well, well

When I get you home
What I want to do
Baby I want to sample
Everything with you

Yes, I wanna love you
I don't wanna fight
I can thing of something
When I get you home tonight

All I want is loving
Anything will do
I'm your glass of poising
And I'm acting up on you

If you want love
If you want to fight
Doesn't really matter
I want you tonight

If you want love
If you want to fight
Doesn't really matter
I want you tonight

Yeah you know what you got here
You got the same old story
Happening again
The eternal struggle
The destiny of men

It's the same old story
It's happening again
Life's eternal struggle
The destiny of men

If you want love
If you want to fight
Doesn't really matter
I want you tonight

All I want is love
Anything will do
I'm your glass of poison
And I'm acting up on you

It's the same old song
Being sung in the background
Being sung upfront
But if you wanna get it right
You gotta listen
Heed my words
Listen to me oooh ooh ooh

Anytime you want me
I'm not hard to find
But I can't get your loving
Can't get you off my mind
But if you need sometime
You got me here right now
We can't work it out together
We'll get through this somehow
