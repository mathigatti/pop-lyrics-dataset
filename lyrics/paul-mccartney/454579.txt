Girlfriend i'm gonna tell your boyfriend
Tell him exactly what we're doing
Tell him what you do to me
Late at night when the wind is free
Girlfriend
Girlfriend i'm gonna show your boyfriend
Show him the letters i've been saving
Show him how you feel inside
Then our love couldn't be denied
And we're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine


Till the river stop a-flowin'
Till the wind doesn't wanna blow
Till the flowers stop a-growin'
Till my love doesn't want to know

Girlfriend we'd better tell your boyfriend
Tell him exactly what we're doing
Tell him what he needs to know
Or he may never let you go
Yes, we're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine

Till the river stop a-flowin'
Till the wind doesn't wanna blow
Till the flowers stop a-growin'
Till the ocean's a sea of snow
