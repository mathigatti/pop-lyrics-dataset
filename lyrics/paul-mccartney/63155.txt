Mary had a little lamb, 
his fleece was white as snow, 
Ev'rywhere that Mary went, 
that lamb was sur to go. 


And you could hear them singing: 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 

He followed her to school one day, 
it was against the rules, 
Made the children laugh and play to 
see a lamb at school. 

You could hear them singing: 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 

Soon the teacher turned it out, 
still it lingered near, 
Waited patiently about till 
Mary did appear. 

You could hear them singing: 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 

"But the lamb loved Mary so", 
the eager children cry, 
"And Mary loves the lamb, you know", 
the teacher did reply. 

And you could hear them singing: 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
(Ev'ry body singing) 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
