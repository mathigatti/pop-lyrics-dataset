Well, I was found in the transit lounge
Of a dirty airport town
What was I doing on the road to ruin
Well my mama laid me down
My mama laid me down


Around my hand was a plastic band
With a picture of my face
I was crying, left to die
In this godforsaken place
This godforsaken place

[Chorus:]
Only Mama knows
What she laid me down
In this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from
I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows

I'm passing through
I'm on my way
On the road, no ETA
I'm passing through
No fixed abode
And that is why....
I need to try
To hold on
I've got to hold on [3x]

Was it planned as a one night stand
Or did she live in disgrace
Well, I never
Will I ever
See my father's face
See my father's face

[Chorus 2x ]

Gotta hold on... [4x]
