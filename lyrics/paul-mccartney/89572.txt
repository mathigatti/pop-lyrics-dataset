Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
I need to laugh and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as I touch the ground
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
