You made me cry when you said goodbye.
Ain't that a shame,
Oh my tears fell like rain.
Ain't that a shame,
You're the one to blame.


You broke my heart when you said we'd part.
Ain't that a shame,
Oh my tears fell like rain.
Ain't that a shame,
You're the one to blame.

You're the one to blame.

You made me cry when you said goodbye.
Ain't that a shame,
Oh my tears fell like rain.
Ain't that a shame,
You're the one to blame.

Oh well good goodbye although I'm gonna cry.
Ain't that a shame,
Oh my tears fell like rain.
Ain't that a shame,
You're the one to blame.
