Mr. Moonlight 
You came to me 
one summer night 
And from your beam you made my dream 
And from the world you sent my girl 
And from above you sent us love 
And now she is mine 
I think you're fine 
because we love you 
Mr. Moonlight 
Mr. Moonlight, 
come again please 
here I am on my knees 
beggin if you please 
And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day 
because we love you 
Mr. Moonlight 
And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day 
because we love you 
Mr. Moonlight 
Mr. Moonlight 
Mr. Moonlight
