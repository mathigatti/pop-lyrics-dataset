Run devil run, the angels having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you
Listen what I'm saying to you run, run devil run


By a swamp in alabama in the cold, in the damp
Sittin reading by the light of a kerosene lamp
Lives a holly roller with a mission on her mind
Got to spread the word to anybody, she can find
You can hear her screaming any time in night or day
This is what she says to keep the demons away

Run devil run, the angels having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you
Listen what I'm saying to you run... Run devil run

Her brother and her sister said that she brought them down
Steppin on the bus that was heading to town
There they started drinking, they got into a fight
The sheriff introduced them to the jailhouse for a night
When the holy roller came to town to pay the bail
This is what she sang as she was leaving the jail

Run devil run, the angels having fun

Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you
Listen what I'm saying to you run, run devil, run

Well by the middle of the summer they were back in the shack
Picking cotton for a livin keep 'em on the right track
Visiting the nieghbours trying to spread the good news
Singing gospel music with a hint of the blues
All of them determined to deliver the goods
Now you you hear the music comin out on the woods

Run devil run, the angel having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you,
Listen what I'm saying to you run... Run devil run

Ah you'ld better run, run devil run
You better run, run devil run
