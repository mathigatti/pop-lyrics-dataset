I took a trip into the ocean
High emotion filled me with desire
I had to see what I was fighting
That kept inviting me to take it higher


Well looking back it didn't hurt me
It did something for my soul
It taught me when you find a love
Don't break it, try to make it whole

I took a walk into the fire
When I heard you calling me
I took a chance and what a good thing
It turned out to be

It turned out
It turned out
It turned out
It turned out to be

Well now it's done and out of nowhere
I can go wherever pleases me
If you don't mind some stormy weather
We'll be together in our fantasy

Looking back it didn't hurt me
It did something for my soul
It taught me when you find a love
Don't break it
Try to make it whole

I took a walk into the fire
When I heard you calling me
I took a chance and what a good thing
It turned out to be
