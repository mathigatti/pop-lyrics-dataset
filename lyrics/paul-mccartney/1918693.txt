It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
People tell me love`s for fools
So, here I go, breaking all the rules
It seems so easy
Oh, so doggone easy
It seems so easy
Where you`re concerned, my heart has learned
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
Look into your heart and see
What your love book has set apart for me
It seems so easy
Oh, so doggone easy
It seems so easy
Where you`re concerned, my heart has learned
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
