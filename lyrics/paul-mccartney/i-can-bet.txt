Listen to me
We can give it a try
I'll look you straight in the eye and pull you to me


What I’m gonna do next I’ll leave entirely to your imagination

Do you hear me
If you don’t understand
I’ll take ahold of your hand and pull you near me

What I’m gonna do next, I’ll leave entirely to your imagination
I can bet
I can bet
I can bet you will never guess

I can bet
I can bet
I can bet that you’ll never guess
Oh, no

Come and feel it
We can give it a go
But if you’d rather not know, I won’t reveal it

Cause what I’m gonna do next, I’ll leave entirely to your imagination

I can bet
I can bet
I can bet you will never guess

I can bet
I can bet
I can bet that you’ll never guess
Oh, no

Be straight with me, yeah
Create with me, yeah
Don’t wait for me to be steady
I’ve got no plan, yeah
But I’m your man, yeah
And I’ll be there when you’re ready

What I’m gonna do next, I’ll leave entirely to your imagination

I can bet
I can bet
I can bet you will never guess

I can bet
I can bet
I can bet that you’ll never guess
Oh, no
