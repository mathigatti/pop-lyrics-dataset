We said our goodbyes.
(Ah.. the night before.)
Love was in your eyes.
(Ah.. the night before.)
Now, today I find
You have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.


Were you tellin' lies?
(Ah.. the night before.)
Was I so unwise?
(Ah.. the night before.)
When I held you near,
You were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night
I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did,
It makes me want to cry.
