I'm taking you home tonight
I want to make sure that you're alright
Looks like a cold, cold wind is blowing in
I'm taking you home tonight


Like a train that's left the tracks
The world is falling apart
I'd gladly help to put it back
But tell me where to start

I'm taking you home (yeah!) tonight
I want to make sure that you're alright
Well, the coat you're wearing's way too thin
I'm taking you home tonight

I read the bad news everyday
It's getting harder to cry
Sometimes I'd like to look away
But I can't close my eyes

I'm taking you home (yeah!) tonight
I want to make sure that you're alright
Won't you notify my next of kin?
I'm taking you home tonight

Say yes tonight
Say yes if my suggestion is right
Say yes to me
And that's the way you want it to be

Oh, I'm taking you home (yeah!) tonight
I want to make sure that you're alright
Looks like a cold, cold wind is blowing in
I'm taking you home tonight

Well, life goes by at such a pace
The troubles seem to increase
I know that we can find a place
Where we can get some peace

I'm taking you home (yeah!) tonight
I want to make sure that you're alright
Looks like a cold, cold wind is blowing in
I'm taking you home tonight

So say yes tonight
Say yes if my suggestion is right
Say yes to me
And that's the way you want it to be
