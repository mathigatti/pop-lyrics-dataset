With a little luck, we can help it out
We can make this whole damn thing work out
With a little love, we can lay it down
Can't you feel the town exploding?
There is no end to what we can do together
There is no end, there is no end
The willow turns his back on inclement weather
And if he can do it, we can do it, just me and you


And a little luck, we can clear it up
We can bring it in for a landing
With a little luck, we can turn it on
There can be no misunderstanding

There is no end to what we can do together
There is no end, there is no end
The willow turns his back on inclement weather
We can do it, just me and you

With a little push, we could set it off
We can send it rocketing skywards
With a little love, we could shake it up
Don't you feel the comet exploding?

With a little luck
With a little luck
With a little luck, a little luck, a little luck
With a little luck
With a little luck
With a little luck, a little luck, a little luck
