The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wing of spring
And you appear in all your splendour
My one and only love.


The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips, so warm and tender
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own, mmm.

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love.
