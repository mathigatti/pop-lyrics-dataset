I'm all alone, said she
No one to phone, no one to touch me
I'm on my way said the man in the long leather coat
As he started his car


I'm glad you came, said she
You got my note, you understood it
He smiled as he hung up his long leather coat
On the back of the door

Stroll on, baby, step right in
Help yourself to a handful of ev'rything in sight
Let the party begin
Stroll on baby, step right in
Help yourself to a handful of ev'rything in sight
Let the party begin

Oh, I love your coat, said she
(Oh, I love your coat, said she)
He said, well, thank you
(He said, well, thank you)
In your note you said you had
(In your note you said you had)
No one to touch you
(No one to touch you)
So shall I go through?
(So shall I go, so shall I go)
(So shall I go, so shall I go)

Why, yes, she said, you can go on ahead
She took out the key
And she locked him into the bedroom
Oh, oh, oh

Now I am alone, said she
She took a can of really red paint
And she sprayed up and down on the long leather coat
On the bloody red floor

So long, baby, I took you in
Just to show you that your long leather coat
Is really nothing but a handful of skin
Stroll on, baby, step right in
Help yourself to a handful of ev'rything in sight
Let the party begin!

Let the party begin! Ho!

Oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo

Well, let the party, the party begin
