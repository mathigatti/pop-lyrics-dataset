Ding, dong, ding, dong
Ding, dong, ding, dong


The mood is right
The spirits up
Were here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The party's on
The feelings here
It's all because
This time of year
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

Don't cry poor children, sing this song
Ding, dong, ding, dong
Ding, dong, ding

The word is out
About the town
So lift your glass
And don't look down
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The mood is right
The spirits up
Were here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
