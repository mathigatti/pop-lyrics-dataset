I'm a loser, I'm a loser,
And I'm not what I appear to be.
Of all the love I have won or have lost,
There is one love I should never have crossed.
She was a girl in a million my friend,
I should have known she would win in the end.
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me,
I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be.
Although I laugh and I act like a clown,
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown,
My tears are falling like rain from the sky,
Is it for her or myself that I cry.
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me,
I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be.
What have I done to deserve such a fate,
I realize I have left it too late.
And so it's true pride comes before a fall,
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all.
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me,
I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be.
