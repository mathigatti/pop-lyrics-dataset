Burn the midnight lamp
Down until the dawn,
I'll keep watch until I'm sure your coming home.
Shadows play and flicker on the bedroom wall
They turn into a bad dream overnight,
Something could be terribly wrong.
Don't be careless love,
Don't be careless love,
Don't be, don't be careless.


In my dream you're running nowhere
Every step you've taken turns to glue.
Walking down a spiral staircase
Falling through, falling through,
Don't be careless love,
Be careless love.

The lamp burns down and out
I'm getting pretty tired of this,
I feel so bad something might be going amiss,
I won't be there so look out for yourself
You're getting in deep whatever you do,
Don't let me go back to sleep,
Don't be careless love,
Don't be careless love,
Don't be, don't be careless.

Saw your face in the morning paper,
Saw your body rolled up in a rug
Chopped up into two little pieces
By some thug,
Don't be careless love,
Be careless love.

But in the morning light
When I wake up again
You're by my side and that's the way it's always been,
But in the dark your mind plays funny tricks on you,
Your mind plays funny tricks on you,
Your mind plays funny tricks on you,
Don't be careless love.
