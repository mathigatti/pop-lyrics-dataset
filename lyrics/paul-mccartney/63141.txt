I walking down the street the other day 
Who did I meet 
I met a friend of mine and he did say 
Man I can smell your feet a mile away 


Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away 
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away 

Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away 
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away 

I walking down the street the other day 
Who did I meet 
I met a friend of mine and he did say 
Man I can smell your breath a mile away 

Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away 
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away 

Who did I meet 
I met a friend of mine and he did say 
Man I can smell your teeth a mile away 

Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away 
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away
