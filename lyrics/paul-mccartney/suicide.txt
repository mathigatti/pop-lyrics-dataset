Girls it's been my pleasure
To know quite a lot of you.
And in the main
You're pretty sane, it's true.
But there are a few who do to
Doo ti doo too beautiful a job.
It isn't quite what they planned
When the man gets the upper hand.
He's takin' her for a ride.
I'd call it suicide.


If when she tries to run away
And he calls her back, she comes.
If there's a next time, he's okay
Cause she's under both his thumbs.
She limps along to his side
Singing a song of ruin. I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'.
I-I-I-I I'd call it suicide.

She loves to ride in big parades.
But he wouldn't so she won't.
She needs at least a dozen maids.
But if he says no she don't.
He wishes she knew his side.
Soon there'll be trouble brewin' I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'
I-I-I-I I'd call it suicide.

Suicide, she's commitin' it
Suicide, he's not gettin' it
Suicide, it's a quittin' a day.

She limps along to his side
Singing a song of ruin. I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'.
I-I-I-I I'd call it suicide.
