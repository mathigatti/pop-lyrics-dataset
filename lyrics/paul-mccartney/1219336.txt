Staring from a cradboard castle down and out
One of life's young students find what its all about
Paper flutters angry taxi drivers shout


From the pages of a paper candles shine
On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine
They suggest a highly recommended wine
Once again the same old line

Why so sad
My fine young friend
Why so blue

Weary carriage horses stand in single file
Someone at a crowded bus stop wears a friendly smile
Touching nerves that no one's heard from in a while
Papers from the same old file

Why so sad
My fine young friend
Why so blue

Sometimes when eyes meet
You know
They have to meet again
Sometimes birds of a feather
Got to fly
Together, oh

From a dingy attic window candles shine
On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine
Now they drink the highly recommended wine
Free at last and feeling fine

I'm so glad (I am so glad)
My (it's not so bad)
Fine (it's not the end)
Young (I am the friend)
Friend (I am the friend)
Glad for you

Well I'm so glad (I'd be so sad)
My (it's not so bad)
Fine (it's not the end)
Young (I am the friend)
Friend (I am the friend)
Glad for you

You used to be so blue
You used to be so blue
Why so blue?
