No man is an island who has been in love
Bringing understanding every push and shove
Just as fundamental as the stars above
It is benifiting every hand in glove
And you tell me it's a cold day in hell when you surrender
For love and a chance to remember
What we have to hold is more silver and gold


When I walk with you
When I talk with you
Everything will be fine
When I walk with you
When I talk with you
Everything will be fine
Will be fine

It's coincidental we have met before
Let this be the time and place that we explore
With no hesitation knocking at that door
Open up your heart and love forever more
And I tell you it's a cold day in hell but we remember
That song that starts out love me tender
And that king of hearts

When I walk with you
When I talk with you
Everything will be fine
When I walk with you
When I talk with you
Everything will be fine
Will be fine

Picking up the picture of love in pain
I don't have time if what time remains
What I have just tried to explain flew by you
What can I do with a heart of steel
I would impart what I've come to feel
Love is the answer and It is real
I'll always be there beside you

When I walk with you
When I talk with you
Everything will be fine
When I walk with you
When I talk with you
Everything will be fine
Will be fine
When I walk with you
When I talk with you
Everything will be fine
When I walk with you
When I talk with you
Everything will be fine
Will be fine
