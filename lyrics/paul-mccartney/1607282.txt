Love me baby, love me when I'm down
I said love me baby, love me when I'm down
Yeah you gotta love me baby
'cos there's no use hanging around


I said put your arms around me like a sunbeam round the sun
I said put your arms around me like a sunbeam round the sun
Yeah, you gotta love me woman
'cos my life has just begun

Love me baby, love me when I'm down
Oh, love, love me baby, love me when I'm down
Yeah you gotta love me baby
'cos there's no use hanging around

Put your arms around me like a sunbeam round the sun
I said, put your arms around me like a sunbeam round the sun
You gotta love me woman
'cos my life has just begun

Love me baby, love me when I'm down
Oh, love, love, love me baby, love me when I'm down
You gotta love me baby
'cos there's no use hanging around, around, around, yeah

Love me baby, love me when I'm down
Love me baby, love me when I'm down
Oh you gotta love me baby
'cos there's no use hanging around
