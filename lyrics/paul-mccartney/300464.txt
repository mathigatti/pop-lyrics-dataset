As I write this letter...

Treasure these few words 'til we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you - oh


Love, love me do
You know I love you
I'll always be true
Oh, love me do, love me do, love me do, love me do
So please

I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'til the day I do, love,
P.S. I love you - oh

Love, love me do
You know I love you
(You know I love you)
I'll always be true
(I'll always be true)
So love me do, love me do, love me do 

Someone to love
I want someone like you
Someone to love
Someone like you, someone like you, someone like you

As I write this letter
Send my love to you
P.S. I love you

Love, love me do
You know I love you
I'll always be true
(I'll always be true)
You know I love you
(So love me do, love me do, love me do)
So please love me do

Oh, love me do

Love, love me do
You know I love you
I'll always be true
You know I love you
I'll always be true
