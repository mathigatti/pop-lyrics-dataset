Holy smokes land sakes alive I never thought this would happen to me

ah-ha, yeah, ah-ha yeah
I got stung by a sweet honey bee
What a feelin came over me
Well it started in my eyes, crept up to my head
Flew into my arms, til I was stung dead
I'm done, ah-ha, I got stung


hum ah-ha, yeah ah-ha, yeah
She had all that I wanted and more
I've never seen honey bees before
Well she started through my ears, buzzing in my brain
Got stung all over but I feel no pain
I'm done, ah-ha, I got stung

Well don't think I'm complainin'
Because I'm might pleased that we met
'Cause you gimme just one little peck On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold cold sweat

If I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzin' 'round your hive
Ev'ry day at five And I'm never gonna leave once I arrive
I'm done, ah-ha, I got stung
I got stung yeah, I got stung yeah

Well don't think I'm complainin'
Cause I'm might pleased that we met
'Cause you gimme just one little peck On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold cold sweat

If I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzin' 'round your hive
Ev'ry day at five And I'm never gonna leave once I arrive
I'm done, ah-ha, I got stung, yeah
I'm done, ah-ha, I got stung, yeah
Because I'm done, ah-ha, I got stung
