Lift up your head
And remember what your life is
Don't have to give it all away

When you're left for dead
In the middle of a crisis
You must appreciate the day

There's something there
But you're frightened to invite it
Beware of pushing it away

Show that you care
And be certain you don't fight it
You must appreciate the day

She says you don't give back what you take
She got evidence you don't appreciate her love
Oh yeah
She says it's all a show and no-go
You drop everything
Give back
Reciprocate her love
