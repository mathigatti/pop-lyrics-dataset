Win or lose, sink or swim
One thing is certain we'll never give in
Side by side, hand in hand
We all stand together
Play the game, fight the fight
But what's the point on a beautiful night?
Arm in arm, hand in hand
We all stand together
La
Keeping us warm in the night
La la la la
Walk in the light
You'll get it right
Repeat
Win or lose, sink or swim
One thing is certain we'll never give in
Side by side, hand in hand
We all stand together
