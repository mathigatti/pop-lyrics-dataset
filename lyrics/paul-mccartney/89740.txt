Best Thing I Ever Saw
Was A Man Who Loved His Wife
In A Place Where Things Were Good
I Felt Peace In The Neighbourhood


That Feeling In The Air
Something Was Definitely There
It Was A Time When Things Were Good
I Felt Peace In The Neighbourhood

I Was There, I Really Was.
At The Centre Of A Love Vibration.
People Sharing With Their Friends.
Helping Each Other Out
Peace In The Neighbourhood
Helping Each Other Out

Then I Woke Up From My Dream
To See Things As They Really Are
People Struggling To Survive
How Can Peace Hope To Stay Alive?

Well I Was There...I Felt So Good
At The Centre Of A Love Vibration.
People Caring For Their World
Helping Each Other Out.
Peace In The Neighbourhood
Helping Each Other Out.
Peace In The Neighbourhood
Helping Each Other Out.

Best Thing I Ever Saw
I Saw A Man Who Loved His Wife.

Peace In The Neighbourhood
Helping Each Other Out.
Peace In The Neighbourhood.
