Say, its only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me


Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a barnum and bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a barnum and bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me
If you believed in me
If you believed in me
