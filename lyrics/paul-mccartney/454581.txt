By dawn's first light i'll come back to your room again
With my carnation hidden by the packages
I'm carrying, something
I'm carrying something for you
Ah, long time no see baby sure has been a while
And if my reappearance lacks a sense of style
I'm carrying, something
I'm carrying something for you


I'm carrying.
I'm carrying, can't help it.

I'm carrying.
I'm carrying something for you.
