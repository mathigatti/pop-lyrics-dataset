Whenever I want you around yeh
All I gotta do
Is call you on the phone
and you'll come running home
Yeh that's all I gotta do


And when I, I wanna kiss you yeh
All I gotta do
Is whisper in your ear
the words you want to hear
and I'll be kissing you

And the same goes for me
whenever you want me at all
I'll be here yeas I will
whenever you can
You just gotta call on me, yeh
you just gotta call on me


And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeh
All I got to do
Is call you on the phone
and you'll come running how
yeh, that's all I gotta do

And the same goes for me
whenever you want me at all
I'll be here yeas I will
whenever you can
You just gotta call on me, yeh
you just gotta call on me
oh, you just gotta call on me
Ooh, ooh.
