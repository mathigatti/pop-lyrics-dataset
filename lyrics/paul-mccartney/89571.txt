I know it isn't easy to refuse
A lot of thoughts are flying thru' your head
Tell me this before you have to choose
Would you rather be alive or dead?


It's as simple as that (simple as that)
Would you rather be alive or dead?
It's as simple as that (simple as that)
It's so simple
It makes you wanna cry

They ask you if you wanna join in
You linger for a minute or so
Well now's a perfect time to begin
Are you gonna say yes or no?

It's as simple as that (simple as that)
Are you gonna say yes or no?
It's as simple as that (simple as that)
It's so simple
It makes you wanna cry

And if you love your life
Everybody will love you too
Yes if you love your life
Everybody will love you too

It's harder when you start to get round
I want you to remember what I said
I know you never like to let them down
But would you rather be alive or dead?

It's as simple as that (simple as that)
Would you rather be alive or dead?
It's as simple as that (simple as that)
It's so simple

It's as simple as that (simple as that)

Simple as that, simple as that

And if you love your life
Everybody will love you too
Ow!
Yes if you love your life
Everybody will love you too

And if you love
And if you love
And if you love

Oh!
