Though is so beautiful, but she is so fine
Yes she is so beautiful and she says, she's mine


For her face that shines, in the morning glow
And the outside world, will never know
What she means to me, and what I owe to her

But she is so beautiful, she is so devine
Yes she is so beautiful, and she's mine, she's mine

She can make me smile, as we start the day
And to hear her laugh, takes my breath away
Will I ever find, any words to say to her

Though is so beautiful, but she is so fine
Yes she is so beautiful, and she's mine, she says, she's mine
