Treat her gently
Treat her kind
She doesn't even know her own mind
Treat her simply
Take it slow
Make it easy
And let her know
You'll never find another way


Here we sit
Two lonely old people
Eaking our lives away

Bit by bit
Two lonely old people
Keeping the time of day

Here we sit
Out of breath
And nobody asked us to play

Old people's home for the play
Nobody asked us to play

Treat her gently
Treat her kind
She doesn't even know her own mind

Treat her simply
Make it slow
Take it easy
And let her know
You'll never find another way

Here we sit
Two lonely old people etc
Nobody asked us to play
