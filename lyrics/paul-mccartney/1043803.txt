For I have got
Another girl.
Another girl.


You're makin' me say that I've got
Nobody but you
And as from today, well, I've got
Somebody that's new.
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want,

For I have got
Another girl.
Another girl.

She's sweeter than all the girls and
I've met quite a few.
Nobody in all the world can
Do what she can do
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop,

For I have got
Another girl.
Another girl who will love me 'til the end.
Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend.

I don't want to say that I've been
Unhappy with you,
But as from today, well, I've seen
Somebody that's new.
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want,

For I have got
Another girl.
Another girl who will love me 'til the end.
Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend.

I don't want to say that I've been
Unhappy with you,
But as from today, well, I've seen
Somebody that's new.
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want,

For I have got
Another girl.
Another girl.
Another girl.
