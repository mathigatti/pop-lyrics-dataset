Yes it's me and I'm in love again
Had no lovin since you know when
You know I love you
Yes I do
And I'm saving all my lovin just for you


Need your loving and I need it bad
Just like a dog when he's goin mad
Woo-e baby woo-o-e
Baby wont you give your love to me

Eenie meenie and miney-mo
Told you don't want me around no more
Woo-e baby woo-o-e
Baby don't you let your dog bite me

Yes it's me and I'm love again
Had no lovin since you know when
You know I love you
Yes I do
And I'm saving all my lovin just for you

Any minute and many more
Told you don't want me around no more
Woo-e baby woo-o-e
Baby don't you let your dog bite me
