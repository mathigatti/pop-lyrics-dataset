To me you are the loveliest thing I've seen all day
You can't take that away
No, you can't take that away
All my life, I wondered why it couldn't be this way
That was up until today
Oh it had to be this way


Today, wait until the morning comes
Before you slip away
Without permission
Without suspicion
Without permission given

You seem to have a friendlier smile than all the rest
Well I looked and you were best
Yeah i've looked at all the rest
You can't imagine passionate words that I would say
If only you would stay
Oh you know you gotta stay

Today, wait until the morning comes
Before you slip away
Without permission
Without suspicion
Without permission given

You used to be and early bird
But how was I to know you would leave without shedding a tear
I only want to love you
I'll make a wish and suddenly I'm glad that I have you here
Oh I'm glad I have you here
Today

To me you are the loveliest thing I've seen all day
And you can't take that away
No, you can't take that away
All my life, I wondered why it couldn't be this way
That was up until today
Yeah, it had to be this way

Today, wait until the morning comes
Before you slip away, today
Before you slip away
Without permission
Without suspicion
Without permission given to you, ah
