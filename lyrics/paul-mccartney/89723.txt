SHANTY I know I should be glad of this
For to be thankful is
To know.


I hope
That you will still be here,
The time is drawing near
For us to know.

MARY DEE (no longer as a ghost)
I'll always be here
As long as you've got time for me.
Whether it's joy or sadness,
It doesn't matter
As long as you have time for me,
We will be together.

SHANTY
I know That to be thankful is
Not what I need, but just for right now
It's all I've got.
I know that patience is a virtue.
But at this time in my life
I need something more.

Something in the air
Is slowly drawing us together.

MARY DEE
Sit tight,
Be brave.
And believe in something more.

SHANTY
If I could sit still,
It I could be courageous.
I have a feeling that there's something
Drawing us inevitably towards it.

MARY DEE
If you have patience,
You needn't wait for ever.
This is the story that they tell the children
Who are always asking the question.

SHANTY
I know Someone is making sense.

MARY DEE
We have a common sense.

(Ah)

For the enemies of love.
