You don't need anybody to hold you,
here I stand with my arms open wide,
give me love and remember, what I told you,
I'll keep you satisfied.
You don't need anybody to kiss you,
ev'ry day I'll be here by your side,
don't go 'way, I'm afraid that I might miss you,
I'll keep you satisfied.
You can always get a simple thing like love anytime,
but it's diff'rent with a boy like me and a love like mine.
So believe ev'rything that I told you,
and agree that with me by your side,
you don't need anybody to hold you,
I'll keep you satisfied.
