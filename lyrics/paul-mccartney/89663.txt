Looking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves away
Like the sun that rises every day
We can chase the dark clouds from the sky


I gave my promise to you girl
I don't want to take it back
You and me, side by side
We know how to change the world
That is why I gave my promise to you girl

Hey why wait another day
That won't get us anywhere
All the time that it takes
To repair this frail old world
Will be ours
I made my promise to you girl

Every single second of our lives
We can use to chase the clouds away

Well there's no more barking up a tree
No more howling at the moon
They won't see you and I
Diving for the deepest pearl
That is why I gave my promise to you girl

Looking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves away
