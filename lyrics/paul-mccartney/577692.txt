A room with a view and you
And no one to worry us,
No one to hurry us through this dream we've found.


We'll gaze at the sky and try
To guess what it's all about,
Then we we will figure out why the world is round.

We'll be as happy and contented as birds upon a tree,
High above the mountains and sea.

We'll build and we'll coo -oo-oo-
And sorrow will never come,
Oh, will it ever come true, a room room with a view.

We'll build and we'll coo -oo-oo-
And sorrow will never come,
Oh, will it ever come true, a room room with a view.
Oo-oo, a room with a view.
