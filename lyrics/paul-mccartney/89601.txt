Darling, I love you very, very, very much
And I really am relying on your touch
But with all these people listening in
I don't know where I ought to begin
Maybe we could hit upon a word
Something that the others haven't heard
When you want me to love you
Just tell me to press


Right there, that's it. Wes. when you feel the stress
Don't just stand there, tell me to press

You can give me what I want, I must confess
My body needs attention, my mind is in a mess
Oklahoma was never like this
Never like this, it was never like this
Ever like this, say was it ever like this?
Oklahoma was never like this
It was never like this

Darling, I know it really wouldn't be a crime
If I say I want to lnve you all the time
But with all these people listening in
I don't know where I ought to begin
Maybe we should have a secret code
Before we both get ready to explode
When you want me to love you
Just tell me to press. Press...

Right there, that's it. Yes
When you feel the stress
Don't just stand there
Won't you tell me to press?
