Teacher said I had my head in the clouds
They directed, I suspected, disconnected hat in my way


On the street I had my feet on the ground
Stood corrected, well protected, resurrected had it my way

I've got my feet in the clouds, got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square as long as their not around
But I find it very very very very very very hard
Yes I find it very very very very very very hard

Love is fab it's like a stab in the heart
My hidden treasure, made to measure, for my pleasure, I had it my way

I've got my feet in the clouds, got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square as long as their not around
But I find it very very very very very very hard
Oh I find it very very very very very very hard
Yes I find it very very very very very very hard...

I've got my feet in the clouds, got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square as long as their not around
But I find it so hard I find it so hard
