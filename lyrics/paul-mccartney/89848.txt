But I don't want no other baby but you, I don't want no other baby but you,
cause no other baby can thrill me like you do.


Got a little woman, lives across the hall, I got a little woman, she lives across the hall
and most every evening she's asking me to call.
But I don't want no other baby but you, I don't want no other baby but you,
cause no other baby can thrill me like you do.

But lots of other women say be my daddy do, yeah, lots of other women say be my daddy do,
but I tell them I don't want no other baby like you.
I said, I don't want no other baby but you, I don't want no other baby but you,
cause no other baby can thrill me like you do.
