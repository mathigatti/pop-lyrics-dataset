I can't find my love
No matter how hard I try
She's giving me the run around
And makes me wanna lay down and cry


Come home back to me right now
You shouldn't have to stay away
No, I won't play no hide-and-seek
That's not a game I wanna play

I'm traveling around the world
Trying to find the perfect babe
Found myself a little girl
But now she's started running away

Come home back to me right now
Don't wait 'til they unleash the hounds
If you don't get back today
To find your trail I'ma hunt you down

I've been taken for my younger brother
Life's a bastard but I have no other
I keep waking up when I'm trying to sleep
I've been naked since I was born
Born to follow you wherever you go
But my problem is I never do know
Where you're taking me
I don't have a clue
I've been naked since I was born

Take my toll and set me free
Free to fly home
There's a place I'm meant to be
Back at home

I've been broken in so many places
Brought together by a sea of faces
What to make of that
I don't hardly know
I've been naked for so long, so long

I've been taken for my younger brother
Life's a bastard but I have no other
I keep waking up when I'm trying to sleep
I've been naked for so long
I've been naked for so long
So long, so long, yeah
