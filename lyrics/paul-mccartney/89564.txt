There is a pain, inside my heart
You mean so much to me
Girl, i love you, girl, i love you so bad


And if you leave, my pain will go
But that's no good to me
Girl, i love you, yes, i love you so bad

Well it feels so good, sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything i've ever had

There was a pain, but now you're here
And i don't fear a thing
Girl, i love you, yes, i love you so bad
And she said, boy, i love you
Boy, i love you so bad

- solo -

Girl, i love you
Girl, i love you so bad

Well it feels so good, sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything i've ever had

There was a pain, but now you're near
And i don't fear a thing
Girl, i love you
Girl, i love you so bad
And she said
Boy, i love you
Boy, i love you so bad
Girl, i love you
Girl, i love you
