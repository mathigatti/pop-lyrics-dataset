You were the one, the one who would love me, after the ball.
After the ball, after the ball, you were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me, after the ball.

Nowhere was a friendly face to be found.
Later on, I awoke, but the party it was over
There you were waiting to bring me 'round.


How many million miles, day-oh?
How many million miles, day-oh?
When I get up, up, up in the morning, whoa! Lord I know.
When I look up, up, up in the morning, whoa! Lord I know.
How many million miles, day-oh?
