Now my room has got two windows
but the sunshine never comes Thru,
You know it's always dark and dreary
since i broke off, baby, With You!


I live on a lonely avenue,
My little girl wouldn't say, "i do".
Well, i feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you.
I could cry, i could cry, i could cry,
I could die, i could die, i could die,
Because i live on a lonely avenue, lonely avenue.

(now you know my) covers they feel like lead
and my pillow it feels Like Stone,
Well, i've tossed and turned so every night,
I'm not used to being alone!

I live on a lonely avenue,
My little girl wouldn't say, "i do".
Well, i feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you.
I could cry, i could cry, i could cry,
I could die, i could die, i could die,
Because i live on a lonely avenue, lonely avenue.

Lonely Avenue, Lonely Avenue

Now i've been so sad and lonesome
since you've left this Town,
If i could beg or borrow the money,
child, i would be a highway Bound!

I live on a lonely avenue,
My little girl wouldn't say, "i do".
Well, i feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you.
I could cry, i could cry, i could cry,
I could die, i could die, i could die,
Because i live on a lonely avenue, lonely avenue.
