My dear sweetheart, I'm writing you
Just a few lines to tell you that I'm low
Oh, baby, my baby
Funny, but I still love you


You went away, didn't say goodbye
But I still love you, Lord, I wonder why
Oh, baby, my baby
Funny, but I still love you

I don't know who was right or who was wrong
All I know as I'm so tired, so tired of being alone
But if you care, like I care
Catch the next stream line, bring yourself back here
Oh, baby, my baby
Funny, but I still love you

I miss your lovin'
You know what I mean
Remember how you used to make me scream
Oh, baby, my baby
It's funny, but I still love you
