Poor little, sad little blue bluesette
Dont you cry, dont you fret,
You can bet one lucky day you'll waken,
and your blues will be foresaken,
Some lucky day lovely love will come your way.


If there is love in your heart to share,
Dear Bluesette don't despair
Some blue boy is waiting just like you'
To find a someone to be true to,
Two loving arms you can nestle in to stay.

Get set, Bluesette,
True love is coming,
Your lonely heart soon will be humming.

Pretty little Blusette,
Musn't be a mourner,
Have you heard the news yet,
Love's 'round the corner.
Love wrapped in rainbows and tied with pink ribbons
To make your next springtime
Your gold weding ring time.
