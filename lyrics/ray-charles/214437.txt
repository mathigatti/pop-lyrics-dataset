Here we all work 'long the mississippi
Here we all work while the white folk play
Pullin' them boats
From the dawn till sunset
Gettin' no rest till the judgment day


Don't look up and don't look down
You
Don't das make the boss man frown
Bend your knees and bow your head
And pull that rope until your
Dead

Let me go 'way from the mississippi
Let me go 'way from the white man boss
Show me that stream
Called the river jordan
That's the old stream that i long to cross.

Ol' man river, that ol' man river

He don't say nothin', but he must know somethin'
He just keeps rollin', he keeps on rollin' along

He
Don't plant tatters, and he don't plant cotton
And them what plants em, are soon forgotten
But ol'
Man river, just keeps rollin' along

You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all achin' and racked with
Pain
Tote that barge and lift that bail
You get a little drunk and you lands in jail

I gets weary,
And sick of trying
I'm tired of livin', but i'm scared of dyin'
But ol' man river, he just keeps
