I'm gonna move baby, way out on the outskirts of town
I'm gonna move baby, way out on the outskirts of town
You see I don't need no-body, always hangin' 'round


Let me tell you honey, we gonna move away from here
I don't need no iceman, I'm gonna, get you a Frigidaire
When we move, way out on the outskirts of town
Whoa, you see we won't need no-body, always hangin' 'round

&lt;keyboard solo&gt;

It may seem funny honey, funny as can be
If we have a dozen children, you know they AW-LL-all better look
like me
When we move, way back 'a town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, we won't need no-body, always hanging around

We don't need nobody baby, AW-LL-always hanging 'round
Hangin' 'round
