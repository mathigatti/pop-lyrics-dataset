Fifty nifty united states from thirteen original colonies;
Fifty nifty stars in the flag that billows so beautif'ly in the

Each individual state contributes a quality that is great.
Each individual state deserves a bow, we salute them now.

Shout 'em, scout 'em, tell all about 'em,
One by one till we've given a day to ev'ry state in the u.s.a.
