(I can't stop loving you) 
I've made up my mind 
To live in memory of the lonesome times 
(I can't stop wanting you) 


It's useless to say 
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday 
(Dreams of yesterday) 
Those happy hours that we once knew 

Tho' long ago, they still make me blue 
They say that time heals a broken heart 
But time has stood still since we've been apart 

(I can't stop loving you) 
I've made up my mind 
To live in memory of the lonesome times 
(I can't stop wanting you) 

It's useless to say 
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday 
(Those happy hours) 
Those happy hours 
(That we once knew) 
That we once knew 

(Tho' long ago) 
Tho' long ago 
(Still make me blue) 
Still ma-a-a-ake me blue 

(They say that time) 
 They say that time 
(Heals a broken heart) 
Heals a broken heart 
(But time has stood still) 
Time has stood still 
(Since we've been apart) 
Since we've been apart 

(I can't stop loving you) 
I said I made up my mind 
To live in memory of the lonesome times 
(I can't stop wanting you) 
It's useless to say 
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterday 
(Of yesterday)
