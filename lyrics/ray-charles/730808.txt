In a sparkling moment,
I loved you, you loved me.
Oh, how sweet fate can he.
In that happy moment
I forgot all my past.
Now I realize the way
The spell was cast,
At last,
Refrain
Once we walked alone
Down by the river,
All the world our own
Down by the river.
Maybe the river made our love song start.
Full was the river, yet more full my heart.
So I love you two,
You and the river,
I'll he there for you,
I and the river
You will remember when you hear my song
Down when the river rolls along
