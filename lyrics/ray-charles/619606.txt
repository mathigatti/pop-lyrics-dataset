What have I got to do to make you love me
What have I got to do to make you care
What do I do when lightening strikes me
And I wake up and find that you are not there


What have I got to do to make you want me
What have I got to do to be heard
what do I say when it's all over
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

2x chorus:
It's sad,  so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad , so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh, it seems to me
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

What do I do to make you love me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I do when lightening strikes me
What have I got to do,
What have I got to do?
When sorry seems to be the hardest word...
