That big eight-wheeler runnin' down the track
 Means your true lovin' daddy ain't acomin' back
 'Cause he's movin on, he's rollin on
 You were flyin to high for my little ol' sky
 So I'm movin' on


 But some day baby when you've had you play
 Your gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
 Keep movin' on, keep rollin' on
 You were flyin to high for my little ol' sky
 So I'm movin' on. Move on baby.

 Mr. Farmer won't you please listen to me
 'Cause I gotta pretty momma in Tennessee
 Keep rollin on, keep movin' on,
 Please listen to me let this rattler free
 And keep movin' on
 Move on ol' son, move on

 Well I told you baby from time to time
 But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
 And now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
 I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
 But I'm movin' on
 Move on baby, move on
 I said move on, I said move on,
 I said move on, I said move on,
 Well I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
 I said move on, I said move on
