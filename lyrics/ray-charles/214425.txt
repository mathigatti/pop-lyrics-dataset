Just for a thrill
You changed the sunshine to rain
Just for a thrill
You filled my heart with pain


To me you were my pride and joy
But to you, i was merely a toy
A plaything, that you could toss around at will

Just for a thrill
You made my life one sad song
Just for a thrill
You just led me along

Although you're free and havin' your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill

&lt;piano solo&gt;

Although you're free and havin' your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Well, it was just for a thrill

And baby you, you, made my heart stand still
