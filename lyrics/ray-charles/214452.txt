I awakened, whoa this morning,
And I was filled with despair
All my dreams, turned to ashes and gall,
And as I looked back on my life
It was barren and bare


And without love I have nothing,
I have nothing at all

Once I had, whoa a sweetheart
Who loved only me
There was nothing, that she would not give,
But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see
That a heart without love cannot live

Whoa, without love I have nothing,
Whoa, without love, friends I have nothing, at all
Ohhh, I have conquered, yeah the world
Oh-hooo, tell me what did I have?
Without love, ohh, I have nothing now, at all
