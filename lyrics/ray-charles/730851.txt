If you were mine
I'd never let you leave me
If you were mine
I'd never let you go


Because you are
Just what I've always wanted
And I think that you oughta know

From the moment I first saw you
Girl, you went straight to my brain
In my heart I've got a feeling
That I could never explain

If you were mine
You'd never know no sorrow
If you were mine
I'd marry you tomorrow
Yes, I would

Believe me, girl
What the occasion
If you call me
I'll come with no persuasion

You just call
And I'll come running
Oh, yes, I will, baby
Come rain or storm
Hail or snow

Cause the way I feel about you
No place is too remote to go

Oh, well, baby, oh, well
Now now now now now
Oh, baby, oh, well
