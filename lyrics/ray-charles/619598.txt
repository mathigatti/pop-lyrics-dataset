1) If I give you my love, what will you give in
return, if I give you my love
Will you cause my heart to yearn , and will it bring
me sadness, with so many tears
and  will it bring me gladness , all through out the
years


2) if I give you my word , will you give me your word
too
if I vow to yours, promes me that you l be true
am I playing with fire , tell me are you concerned ,
if I give you my love
what  wil you give in return

( SOLO PIANO, GUITAR )

am I playing with fire, tell me are you concerned
