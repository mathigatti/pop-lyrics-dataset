Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
I say Georgia, Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
I say Georgia, oh Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you


oh oh oh oh, Georgia, Georgia
no peace, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
I say just an old sweet song
keeps Georgia on my mind
