Some people cry the blues, I never could
I had no time for tears, life was too good
I had the brightest smile in town, oh yeah
Till you came along, and you turned it upside down.


Everything went my way, life was a ball
But then you came along and changed it all
You took the brightest smile in town,
Yeah you took it baby, and you turned it upside down

You brought me love, oh tender love
That made my whole world glow
And then you took it all away
Just why, I'll never know

I'll soon forget in time, And smile again
But I can never smile as I did then
You took the brightest smile in town, oh Yeah
You took it baby, and you turned it upside down
