I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
Baby, it's cold out there
This evening has been
Been hoping
That you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands
They're just like ice


My mother
Will start to worry
Beautiful
What you're hurry
And father
Will be
Pacing the floor
Listen
To that fireplace
Roar
So really
I'd better scurry
Beautiful
Please don't hurry
Well, maybe
Just a half
A drink more
Put some records on
While i pour

And the neighbors
Might think
Baby
It's bad out there
Say
What's in this drink?
No cabs
To be had out there
I wish i knew how
Your eyes
Are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat
Your hair looks swell

I ought to say
No, no, no sir
Mind if i
Mmove in closer?
At least i'm gonna say
That i tried
What's the sense of
Hurtin' my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Baby
But it's cold outside

I simply must go
But baby
It's cold outside
The answer is no
I say
It's cold out there
The welcome
Has been how lucky
That you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out that window
Man that's hard

My sister
Will be suspicious
Gosh
Your lips look delicious
My brother
Will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical
Shore
My maiden
Aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh
Your lips are delicious
Well maybe
Just a cigarette more
Oh
Never such a blizzard
Before

I've got to go home
Baby
you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
It's up
To your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill
When you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do
This thing to me

There's bound
To be talk tomorrow
Think
Of my lifelong sorrow
At least there
Will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia
And died
I really can't stay
Get over that old lie

Oh
But it's cold outside
