I'll take you strolling, 'round, lover's lane
I'll come to see you, even in the rain
I'll do any, thing for you, but work


Sing your praises, hold your hand
Tell the world that I think you're grand
I'll do any, thing for you, (he-he) but slave

I'll take you, to dine and dance
Fill your ears with sweet romance
See baby, I know I'm handsome but what the heck
I'm all yours if you pay the check

I'm yours to have, yours to hold
But that word 'work' just leaves me cold
I'll do any, thing for you, but work

{solos}

I'll take you, out to dine and dance
Fill your ears with sweet romance
Baby, I'm so good lookin' it's a shame
But I'm all yours if you pay the check

Yours to have, yours to hold
That word 'work' just leaves me cold
