Don't set me free 
And leave me all alone 
Don't make me be 
Just a rolling stone 
Lock me up and throw the key away 
Make me a prisoner night and day 
And whatever you do to me 
Don't set me free 


Don't set me free 
On my knees I pray 
Have mercy on me 
Don't send me away 
Like a train jumpin off a track 
Without ya baby, I'd blow my stack 
And whatever you do to me 
Don't set me free
 
Like a stamp on a letter, if you let me stick with you 
I could love you better, than anyone else can do 

So don't set me free 
Though I've done you wrong 
Baby can't you see 
Without you I can't get along 
Keep me in a state of agony 
Make me miserable as can be 
And whatever you do to me 
Don't set me free 

Like a stamp on a letter, if you let me stick with you 
I could love you better, than anyone else can do 

So don't set me free 
Though I've done you wrong 
Baby can't you see 
Without you I can't get along 
Keep me in a state of agony 
Make me miserable as can be 
And whatever you do to me 
Don't set me free 
No, no, no, don't set me free 
I'm saying no, no don't set me free
