You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew
You're right out of a book
The fairy tale I read when I was five
No armored knight out of a book
Was more enchanted by a Loralei
Then I
After waiting so long
For the right time
After reaching so long for a star
All at once from long and lonely night time
And despite time, here you are
I cry, "Out of this world"
If you said we were through
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two
With you
