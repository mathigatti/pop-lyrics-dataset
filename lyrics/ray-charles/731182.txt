Dearest one
I write what I'm afraid to speak,
I'm weak when I'm with you,
Tears of love are causing
All the ink to blot
So what am I to do?
Hoping to find the phrases,
Groping to find each word,
How they all burn like blazes,
Now they all seem absurd.
Though I don't know where to end
And to begin
You must give in because


I'm yours sincerely,
The one who loves you dearly,
To think about it nearly takes
My breath away.
Very truly
My passion is unruly,
A dream of you is newly born
Each night and day.
Oh but my thoughts are fervent,
How can I make them plain?
Ever your humble servant
Faithfully I remain.
I'm intending
To find a happy ending
Because I love you dearly
I'm sincerely yours.
