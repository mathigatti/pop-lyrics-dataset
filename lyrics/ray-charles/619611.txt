Lights turned way down low
And music soft and slow
With someone you love so
That's where it's at


Your world turned upside down
You make not a sound
No one else around
That's where it's at

Your heart, beating fast
You're knowing that time will pass
But hoping that it lasts
That's where it's at

That's where it's at
Pretty baby
That's where it's at
Whoa, yes it is
That's where it's at
Pretty baby
That's where it's at
Oh yeah

Let me tell you this one thing

To say, "It's time to go"
And she says, "Yes, I know, but just stay one minute
more"
That's where it's at
Oh let me say it one more time
That's where it's at
Pretty baby
That's where it's at
I know that's where it's at
That's where it's at
Pretty baby
