Angelina, why did you have to go
It's hard enough alone, well you should know
The scars you never showed me
Your eyes that turned away
Angelina, to God for you I prayed


Angelina, I often heard you weep
At times I'd stay awake and watch you sleep
Your innocence would move me
At times you've made me scared
Angelina, my love for you I cared
 
Angelina, in silence you would speak
A simple touch of you and I grew weak
You finally let me hold you
The day before you died
Angelina, my angel in the sky

You finally let me hold you
The day before you died
Angelina, my angel in the sky
