I took a trip on a train, and I thought about you.
I passed a shadowy lane, and I thought about you.
Two or three cars parked under the stars, a windin' stream.
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream.
And every stop that we made, oh I thought about you.
And when I pulled down the shade, then I really felt blue.
I peaked through the crack and looked at the track,
The one goin' back to you, and what did I do?
I thought about you.
