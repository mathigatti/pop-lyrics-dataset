Another bride, Another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, Another reason
To make whoopee


A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, uhh, he answers twice
Its really killin', the boy's so willin'
To make whoopee, whoopee

Picture a little love nest, yeah
Down where the roses cling
Picture that same sweet love nest
See what a year can bring

I tell you the boy's washin' dishes 'n, baby clothes
He's so ambitious, ooh, I tell you he sews
