It brings a tear,
Into my eyes,
When i begin,
To realize,
I've cried so much,
Since you've been gone,
I guess i'm drowning in my own tears,


I sit and cry,
Just like a child
My pouring tears
Are runnin' wild
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess i'll drown in my own tears

I know it's true
Into each life
Some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue
Here without you
It keeps raining
More and more

Why don't you
Come on home
Oh yes so i won't
Be all alone
If you don't think
You'll be home soon

I guess i'll
(drown in my own tears)
Ooh, don't let me
(drown in my own tears)
When i'm in trouble, baby
(drown in my own tears)
Oh, yeah, baby don't let me
(drown in my own tears)
I guess i'll drown in my own tears
