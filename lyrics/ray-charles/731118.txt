See those handsome boys.
See that flash of femininity.
Hear the happy noise.
North and South are in proximity.
Cuban maids,
Men from Ioway,


From parades
While the latin play.
What a day!

North America meets South America.
Two happy countries say "Hello!"
North America meets South America.
They get together to stage a show.
The farmer from the North drops his plow.
Gaucho gives up his cow.
North America meets South America.
There's only one America now!
