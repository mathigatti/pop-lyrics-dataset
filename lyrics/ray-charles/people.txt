People,
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
There are children needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children


Lovers
Are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world,
in the world
With one person,
One very special person
It's a feeling thag gets in your soul
Says you were half now youre whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world.


Lovers

They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person,
One very special person
A feeling is deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first you must be someone who needs people
And people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world.
