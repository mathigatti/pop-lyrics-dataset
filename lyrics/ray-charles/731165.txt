The night is romantic and I am alone.
In vain through my window the moonlight is thrown.
"Oh, Vilia my Vilia!" Oh yes, that's the tune,
The song of the shepherd who cried for the moon


Vilia, oh Vilia, oh let me be true;
My little life is a love song to you.
Vilia, oh Vilia, I've waited so long;
Lonely with only a song.
Vilia, oh Vilia, don't leave me alone!
Love calls to love and my heart is your own.
Vilia, oh Vilia, I've waited so long;
Lonely with only a song.
Only a song
Only a song
