She said "My Daughter, I beg of you
I have a wish that must come true
The last thing you can do for Mama
Please promise me that you will stay
And take my place while I'm away
And give the children love each day"
I had to cry, what could I say


How hard I tried to find a word
I prayed she wouldn't see me cry
Somuch to say that should be heard
But only time to say goodbye to Mama

They say in time that you forget
Yet still today my eyes are wet
I tell myself to smile for Mama
Now soon there'll be another spring
And I will start remembering
The way she loved to hear me sing
Her favourite song, Ave Maria

Ave Maria

The children have all grown up now
I've kept my promise to Mama
I cannot guide them anymore
I've done my best, all for Mama

Ave Maria

But still it seems so very small
For all she did for me
