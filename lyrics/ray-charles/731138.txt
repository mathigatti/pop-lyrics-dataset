Soon, maybe not tomorrow
But soon there'll just be two of us.
Soon you and I will borrow
The moon for just the two of us.
Sweetly and so discreetly
We'll be completely alone
No other world, only our own.
Now we must be contented
With schemes about the two of us.
Yet we can have our sweet-scented dreams
That will come true of us.
For presently and pleasantly
Our hearts will be in tune
So soon, maybe not tomorrow, but soon.
