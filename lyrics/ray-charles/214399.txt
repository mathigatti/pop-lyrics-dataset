Girl, you're my sunshine
Chase away the raindrops
Make it all worthwhile
Make all the pain stop
Just like a river
Keep love flowing
Don't let our world stop
Keep it going


Chorus:
I love you just the way you are
Honey, don't change on me
Girl, don't you change on me.....girl, don't you change on
me....no, no
Girl, you're my lucky star
Honey, don't change on me
Don't change on me.....don't change on me

I used to wonder
Where would I find
Some kind of happiness
And peace of mind
I was living in darkness
But then you came
Bringing the sunlight
Easing my pain

(Chorus)

If there's a heaven
Then this is my prayer
Lord knows I want to know you
If we should meet there
And then forever
We'll walk together
Nothing but sunshine
No more stormy weather
