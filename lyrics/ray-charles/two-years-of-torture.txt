I've often been told that time bring 'bout a change
I've often been told that time bring 'bout a change
Yes I've had two years of torture and
My heart still feel the same
I had a real fine woman, fine as she could be


Let me tell ya, I had a real, real fine woman
Fine as she could be
But the syndicators, back-biters
Stole that little girl away from me
Two years of being without her
Seven hundred and thirty days

And I still remember her little brown
Body and the sweet love baby way
Two years of torture and I'm still in misery
Oh, but I'm doomed as a lover unless
She come back to me
