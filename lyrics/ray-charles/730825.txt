So you met someone who set you back on your heels - goody, goody
You met someone and now you know how it feels - goody, goody
You gave him your heart too, just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces, now how do you do
You lie awake just singing the blues all night - goody, goody
And you think that love's a barrel of dynamite
Hooray and hallelujah, you had it coming to y'a
Goody goody for him, goody goody for me
I hope your satisfied you rascal you, I hope your satisfied 'cause you got yours
