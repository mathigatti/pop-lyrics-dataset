My left shoe's on my right foot,
My right shoe's on my left.
Oh! listen to me Mimi,
Of reason I'm bereft!
The buttons of my trousers
Are button'd to my vest;
Oh! listen to me Mimi,
Mere passion's in my breast!


Mimi, you funny little good for nothing Mimi,
Am I the guy?
Mimi, you sunny little honey of a Mimi,
I'm aiming high!
Mimi, you've got me sad and dreamy,
You could free me, if you'd see me.
Mimi, you know I'd like to have
A little son of a Mimi bye and bye.
