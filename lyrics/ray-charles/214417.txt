One of these days
And it won't be long
You're gonna look for me
And I'll be gone
'Cause I believe
(I believe, yes I believe)
I say I believe right now
(I believe, yes I believe)
Well I believe to my soul now
You're tryin'
To make a fool of me
(I believe it, I believe it)


Well you're goin' 'round here
With your head so hard
I think
I'm gonna have to use my rod
'Cause I believe
(I believe, yes I believe)
I say I believe right now
(I believe, yes I believe)
Well I believe to my soul now
You're tryin'
To make a fool of me
(I believe it, I believe it)

Last night
You were dreaming
And I heard you say
"Oh, Johnny"
When you know my name is Ray
That's why
I believe right now
(I believe, yes I believe)
I say I believe right now
(I believe, yes I believe)
Well I believe to my soul now
You're tryin'
To make a fool of me
(I believe it)
