This used to be a grumpy,
Crabbed old lad
Look at your beamish boy now.
This used to be a jumpy,
Silly and sad
What is simply joy now.
Life was a canyon
Too dark to view,
Till a companion
Was found like you.


I feel at home with you.
You always fit on
The knees that you sit on.
That' s why I feel at home with you.
I love to roam with you.
Each place that we go,
You flatter my ego.
That' s why I feel at home with you.
I've a sensible,
Comprehensible,
Great respect for you.
There's a dash in it
Of a passionate,
Tender feeling, too.
You are a part of me,
Something that's giving me
Reason for living
That's why I feel at home with you.
