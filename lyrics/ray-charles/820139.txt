I can see clearly now the rain is gone.
I can see all obstacles in my way.
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind.
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day.
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day.


Oh yes, i can make it now the pain is gone.
All of the bad feelings have disappeared.
Here is the rainbow i've been praying for.
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day.

(ooh...) look all around, there's nothing but blue
Skyes.
Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skyes.

I can see clearly now the rain is gone.
I can see all obstacles in my way.
Here's the rainbow i've been praying for.
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day.
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day.
Real, real, real, real bright (bright) bright
(bright)
Sunshiny day.
Yeah, hey, it's gonna be a bright (bright) bright
(bright)
Sunshiny day.
