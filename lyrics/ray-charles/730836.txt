Back home our girls are models of good behavior
You're taught you have to save your charms from the men.
In school, our girls are taught how to use discretion.
Each day we have a session from nine to ten.
We're taught the why and wherefore,
How and when~


When you talk
Don't talk, just sigh!
Get coy! Get shy!
That's how to win friends and influence people.
When you dance
Forget your feet!
Get close! Get sweet!
That's how to win friends and influence people.

Babes begin with
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Big girls win with
Yah! Yah! Yah!
But when you love
And find you're caught
You'll give no thought
To how to win friends and influence people.
