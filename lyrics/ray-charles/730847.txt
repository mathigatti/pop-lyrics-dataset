I'd know you anywhere, I'd know that grin,
I'd know you anywhere when you walked in,
I would tingle with a single glance in your eye,
Watching the starlight dance in your eye.


You saw my vacant stare, you understood,
I'd love you anywhere, honest I would,
I was certain this would happen, strange as it seems,
I'd know you anywhere from my dreams.
