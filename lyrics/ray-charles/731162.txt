You're just too marvelous
Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean they just aren't swell enough
You're much too much, and just too very very
To ever be, in Webster's dictionary
And so, I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words


You're much too much, and just too very very
To ever be, in Webster's dictionary
And so, I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words
