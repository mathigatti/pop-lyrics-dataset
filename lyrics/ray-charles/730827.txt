It happened
I felt it happened
I was awake
I wasn't blind
I didn't think
I felt it happened
Now I belive in matter over mind.
And now you see we mustn't wait
The nearest moment that we marry is too late!
Have you met Miss Jones
Someone said as we shook hands
She was just Miss Jones to me
Then i said Miss Jones
You're a girl who understand
I'm a boy who must be free.
And all at once I lost my breath
And all at once was scared to death
And all at once I hold the eatrh and sky!
Now I met Miss Jones
And we'll keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I
