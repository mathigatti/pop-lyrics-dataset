Well I heard about the fella you've been dancing with
All over the neighbourhood
So why didn't you ask me, baby
Didn't you think I could

Well, I know that the Bugaloo is out of sight
But the shing-a-ling's the thing tonight
But if that was you and me out there, baby
I would have shown you how to do it right

Do it right
Do it right (do it right), (do it right ), (do it right )
