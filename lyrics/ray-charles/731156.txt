This funny world makes fun of the things that you strive for,
This funny world can laugh at the dreams you're alive for.
If you're beaten concealit,
There's no pity for you,
For the world cannot feel it,
Just keep to yourself,
Weep to yourself.
This funny world can turn right around and forget you,
It's always sure to roll right along when you're through.
If you are broke you shouldn't mind,
It's all a joke for you will find .
This funny world is making fun of you.
