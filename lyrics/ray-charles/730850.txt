Mister Shylock was stingy
I was miserly too.
I was more selfish
And crabby than a shellfish.
Oh, dear, it's queer
What love can do!
I'd give all my possessions
For you
I've got five dollars
I'm in good conditions
And I've got ambition
That belongs to you.
Six shirts and collars
Debts beyond endurance
On my life insurance
That belongs to you!
I've got a heart
That must be spurtin'!
Just be certain
I'll be true
Take my five dollars!
Take my shirt and collars!
Take my heart and hollers!
"Ev'rything I've got belongs to you!"
I've got five dollars
Eighty-five relations
Two lace combinations
They belongs to you!
Two coats with collars
Ma and Grandma wore'em
All the moths adore 'em
They belongs to you!
I've got two lips
That care for mating
Therefore waiting
Will not do!
Take my five dollars!
Take my shirt and collars!
Take my heart and hollers!
"Ev'rything I've got belongs to you!"
