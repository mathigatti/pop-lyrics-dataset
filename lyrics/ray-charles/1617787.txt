I'm laughing and clowning
Just to keep from crying
I'm laughing and clowning
Just to keep from crying


I'm trying to hide the fact
That I've got a worried mind

Being the life of the party
Seems to be my role
Ever since you left me, girl
Being the life of the party
Seems to be my role

I'm trying to hide my feelings
And I'm trying to hide my soul
Yes, I am

Well, listen, one more thing

I stand in the doorway
Watching all the girls go through
I stand in the doorway
Watching all the girls go through

Yes, I do

I'm trying to find me somebody
To make my mind off of you

Pick it for me, son

Whoa, I keep laughing and clowning
To make my mind off of you, girl
