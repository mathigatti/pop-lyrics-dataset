Unchain my heart, baby let me be
Unchain my heart 'cause you don't care about me
You've got me so like a pillow case
But you let my love go away so
Unchain my heart, oh, please, set me free


Unchain my heart, baby let me go
Unchain my heart, 'cause you don't love me no more
Ev'ry time I call you on the phone
Some fella tells me that you're not at home so
Unchain my heart, oh, please, set me free

I'm under you spell like a man in a trance
But I know darn well that I can't stand a chance

So unchain my heart let me go away
Unchain my heart, you worry me night and day
Why lead me through a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
So unchain my heart, oh, please, set me free
