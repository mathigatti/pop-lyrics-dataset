Sue wants a barbecue, Sam wants to boil a ham,
Grace votes for bouillabaisse too
Jake wants a weinie bake, steak and the layer cake,
And he'll get a tummy ache too.
We'll rent a tent or a teepee, let the town crier cry.
And if it's R.S.V.P., this is what I'll reply.
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening, tell 'em I'll be there,
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening, better save a chair.
Oh, when the party's a-getting a glow on, and singing fills the air,
In the shank of the night when the doing's all right,
You can tell 'em I'll be there.


Oh when the party's a-getting a glow on, and the singing fills the air,
In the shank of the night when the doing's all right,
You can tell them I'll be there.
In the shank of the night when the doing's all right,
You can tell them I'll be there.
