I could have been a gambler
'coz I'm good with the cards
I could have been a lover
breakin' other's hearts
and I feel so silly
bettin' on the dice
and a lover seldom sees
the same girl twice


and that is why (that is why)
that's why I chose (that's why I chose)
I chose to sing the blues, yes I did

now, I could have been a doctor
helping the sick
and I could have been a lawyer
but you know that ain't my stick
'coz I feel so bad
if a patient didn't do well
and I feel just as bad
to leave a client in jail

and that is why (that is why)
that's why I chose (that's why I chose)
I chose to sing the blues

(sax solo)

Now a man has a lot
that he could present
just to think I could have been
president
but I can't understand
what politicians say
so I wanna talk to you
in my own little way

and that is why (that is why)
that's why I chose (that's why I chose)
I chose to sing the blues

Yes I did, friends
Don't you know what I mean
I like what I'm doin'
You know, I like the blues
Everybody understands
What I mean when I say
Something like this here
Unnnnnnn-hoo
Yeah
Yeah-hoo
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout when I sing
