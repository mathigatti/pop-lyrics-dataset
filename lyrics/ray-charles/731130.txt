"Say a prayer for me".
She threw her arms around him,
Whispered "God will keep us free".

Take me back to Texas,
They won't take me back alive.


There were seven Spanish angels, at the
Altar of the sun.
They were prayin' for the lovers, in the
Valley of the gun.
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,
There was thunder from the throne,
And seven spanish angels,
Took another angel home.

She reached down and picked the gun up,
That lay smoking in his hand.
She said, "Father please forgive me;

And she knew she couldn't win,
But her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again.

There were seven Spanish angels,
At the Altar of the sun.
They were prayin' for the lovers,
In the Valley of the gun.
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,
There was thunder from the throne,
And seven spanish angels,
Took another angel home.
