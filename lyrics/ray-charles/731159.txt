Somewhere, someday
We'll be close together, wait and see
Oh by the way,
This time the dream's on me
You take my hand
And you look at me adoringly
But as things stand
This time the dream's on me
It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon
To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dream's on me


It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon
To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dream's on me
