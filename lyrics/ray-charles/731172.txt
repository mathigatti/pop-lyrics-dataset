They say a person changes ev'ry seven years:
I've been 3 diff'rent persons with one name.
My years with you will all be made-in-Heaven years.
So love's a thing that will remain the same!
I the future when styles and customs seems strange
My love is the one thing that won't change!


The sun may shine and rise at night
Birds swim and fish take flight -
Height-ho, it's still all right.
We'll be the same
They may have 13 month in a year
Nations may disappear-
Height-ho no need to fear,
We'll be the same!
Though Hollywood's screenless,
Boston beanless,
And the sea turn into land,
The country may tumble
I won't grumble-
I'll be holding your hand
Though love no longer is in style,
Height-ho, we'll only smile!
We've got that flame,
We'll be the same! Verse
