When I need company,
I call on you to see about me,
I wanna walk about it,
Talk about it,
Tell all the world about you,(tell the world about you)


When your with me that's so much fun,
Your all the good things all wrapped in one,
I wanna walk about it,
Talk about it,
Tell the world about you.

Woah, I wanna walk,
I wanna talk,
I wanna tell,

I wanna live,
I'm gonna give,
We'll have a love.

Your so fine,
And your so sweet
You have a love that can't be beat.
I wanna walk about it,
Talk about it,
Tell all the world about you.

Woah, I wanna walk,(walk about)
I wanna talk,(talk about)
I wanna tell, (I wanna tell the all world about you)
Wah, I'm gonna live,(just for you)
I'm gonna give,(that's the truth)
We'll have a love

Your so fine,
And your so sweet
You have a love that can't be beat.
I wanna walk about it,
Talk about it,
Tell all the world about you.
