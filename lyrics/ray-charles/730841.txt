Have you heard I married an angel,
I'm sure that the change'll be awf'lly good for me.
Have you heard an angel I married,
To heaven she's carried this fellow with a kiss,
She is sweet and gentle, so it isn't strange, when I'm sentimental
She loves me like an angel.
Now you've heard, I married an angel,
This beautiful change will be awf'lly good for me.
