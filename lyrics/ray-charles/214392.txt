Ah let me tell you people
About this blackjack game
It's caused me nothing but trouble
And I've only myself to blame


Hey hey hey yeah
How unlucky can one man be
Well every quarter I get
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me

My friends don't come around me
Because I've been so blind
I can't even borrow a nickle
Now I've almost lost my mind

Hey hey hey yeah
How unlucky can one man be
Well every quarter I get
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me

I sat there with two tens
I thought I'd have some fun
The dealer hit sixteen with a five
Just enough to make twenty one

Hey hey hey yeah yeah
How unlucky can one man be
Well every quarter I get
Yeah, blackjack takes it away from me
