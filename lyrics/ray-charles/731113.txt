I laughed at sweethearts I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts Seemed romantic fools
A house in Iceland was my heart's domain
I saw your eyes, now castles rise in Spain!
I took one look at you, that's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still,
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still
Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still
Through all my school days, I hated boys
Those April Fool days brought me loveless joys
I read my Plato, Love, I thought a sin
But since your kiss, I'm reading Missus Glyn!
