I was never able to recite a fable
That would make the party bright;
Sitting at the table I was never able
To become the host's delight;
But now you've given me my after dinner story,
I'll just describe you as you are in all your glory.


[Chorus:]
You were never lovelier,
You were never so fair,
Dreams were never lovelier,
Pardon me if I stare.

Down the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face;
I can only say they chose the proper place.
You were never lovelier,
And to coin a new phrase;
I was never luckier in my palmiest days.
Make a note, and you can quote me,
Honor bright,
You were never lovelier than you are tonight.
