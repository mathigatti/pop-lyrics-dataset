We meet, and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak, and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word?
Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore
You smile, and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss, and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart
