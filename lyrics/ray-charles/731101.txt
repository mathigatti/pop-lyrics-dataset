There's a glistening ring
Around the moon-
Are you listening?
It is not too soon-
Must we sleep tonight alone?
Let us keep tonight
As our very own.


Your heart and my heart
Were made to meet.
Don't make them wait-
Love me tonight!
Why sould our lips
Be afraid to meet?
Love me tonight.
Who knows what tomorrow brings
With the morning light?
Dear, I'm here
With a heart that sings
Love me tonight!
