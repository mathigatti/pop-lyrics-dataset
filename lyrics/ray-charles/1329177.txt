I see trees of green 
Red roses too
I see them bloom 
For me and you
And I think to myself 
What a wonderful world


I see skies of blue 
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day 
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself 
What a wonderful world

The colors 
Of the rainbow 
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces 
Of people going by
I see friends 
Shaking hands 
Saying 
"How do you do?"
They're 
Really saying 
"I love you"

I hear babies cry 
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more 
Than I'll never know
And I think to myself 
What a wonderful world

Yes, I think to myself 
What a wonderful world
