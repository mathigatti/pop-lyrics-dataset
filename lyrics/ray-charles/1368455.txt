Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and taters grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the spring time,
There's where this old darky's heart am long to go.


There's where I labored so hard for old massa,
Day after day in the fields of yellow corn,
No place on earth do I love more sincerely,
Than old Virginny, the place where I was born.

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,
There's where this old darky's life am passed away.

Massa and misses have long gone before me,
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore.
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more.

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and taters grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the spring time,
There's where this old darky's heart am long to go.
