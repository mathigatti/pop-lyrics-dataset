I'm gettin' the spirit in the dark
I'm gettin' the spirit in the dark
People movin', oh people groovin'
They're gettin' the spirit in the dark


Tell me sister, how do you feel?
Tell me my brother brother brother, how do you feel?
You feel like dancin', get up and let's start dancin'
Start gettin' the spirit, the spirit in the dark

(*)
 It's like Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer
 That's how you do it, ain't nothin' to it
 Ride Sally ride
 Put your hands on your hips, cover your eyes
 And move, move with the spirit
 Oh yeah move, move with the spirit
 Oh move, move with the spirit now now now
 Move, with the spirit

How you're gettin' the spirit, I've been gettin' in the dark
I wonder how you're gettin' the spirit, gettin' the spirit in
the dark
People movin', yeah everybody's groovin'
Just gettin' the spirit, how you're gettin' it how you're
gettin' it in the
dark

(repeat *)

(chorus: I think I've got it! &amp;adlib to "move with the
spirit")
