I've gotten down to my last pair of shoes
Can't even win a nickel bet
Because, ah them that's got are them that gets
And i ain't got nothin yet


I'm sneakin in and out duckin' my landlord
All i seem to do is stay in debt
Because, ah them that's got (yeah) are them that gets
And i tell you all i ain't got nothin' yet

That old sayin them that's got are them that gets
Is somethin i can't see
If ya gotta have somethin
Before you can get somethin
How do ya get your first is still a mystery to me

I see folk with long cars and fine clothes
That's why they're called the smarter set
Because they manage to get
When only them that's got supposed to get
And i ain't got nothin yet

Whoah, i tell you all
I ain't found nothing yet.

(spoken)
You know i just don't understand it
I can't seem to get a nickle or a dime for a cup of coffee
I need a hamburg- in fact a hot dog wouldn't be too bad
I would just be grateful if i could get my hands on most
Anything
