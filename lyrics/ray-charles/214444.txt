Tell the truth
Well, you know what you done to me,
You made me fall for you


Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Well you know you can make me do what you want me to

Loving you, feelings started
But, i'm goin' to stop it

If i could, i surely would
I would roll up around you
If i thought it would do any good

Why don't you tell the truth
Tell the truth
Well you know you can make me do what you want me to
