1) I wake up crying
After tossin' and turnin'
And a-yearnin' the whole night long
Pretty baby oh my love since you went away
haven't spent a happy day


2) I wake up crying
After sobbin' and sighin'
And a-wonderin' just what went wrong
Pretty baby well I know I was good to you
Why'd you go and make me blue

* I need your arms to hold me tight now
I need your  lips to kiss me goodnight

I'm so unhappy on my own

Don't don't leave me sad and lonely ( oh now now now
,well well well now baby )

3)I tell you I wake up crying
After tossin' and turnin'
And a-yearnin' the whole night long
Pretty baby why dont you please come back to me
and Save me from this mesery

I want you to save me 
ahhh save me baby
mhhhhhh .......( FADE )
