You'll never know I cried, when I found out you lied
For I've been hangin on this teardrops in my heart


My eyes dare not reveal, the way I realy feel
Because I know I'll cry my heart out if I start

Though I'm pretending, that I dont care
To be with you my darlin, is my prayer

But way down deep inside, I cant give up my pride
So I'll just keep on hiding teardrops in my heart

But way down deep inside, I cant give up my pride
So I'll just keep on hiding teardrops in my heart
