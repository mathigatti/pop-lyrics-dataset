Every time it rains
I think of you
And that's the time
I feel so blue
The rain starts to fall
Across my windows pane
But it's raining teardrops
From my eyes


If you see tears
Here in my eyes
It's just because
You said goodbye
So baby won't you hurry
Because i love you so
And it's raining teardrops
From my eyes

Remeber the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be sad and lonely
If you were here with me

Every single cloud
Would dissappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
So baby won't you hurry
Because i love you so
And it's raining teardrops
From my eyes
