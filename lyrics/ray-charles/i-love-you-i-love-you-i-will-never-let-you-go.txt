I live only for you my love
Just as sure as the stars above
I love you, I love you, I always will
I will not let you go


I dream only of you my love
You're the only girl that I ever think of
I love you, I love you, 'n I always will
I will not let you go

Sometimes when I am lonely
Have nothing to do or say
Thinking of you only
Helps to pass my lonely time away

I'd like to sit around and sing to you my love
Just moan like a mourning dove
You see, I love you, I love you, I always will
I will not let you...

Sometimes when I am lonely
Have nothing to do or say
Thinking of you only
Helps to pass my lonely time away

I'd like to sing to you my love
Just hum like a mourning dove
Oh, I love you, I crave you, 'n I always will
I will not let you go, no, no!
