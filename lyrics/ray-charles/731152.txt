The most beautiful girl in the world picks my ties out
She eats my candy, she drinks my brandy
The most beautiful girl in the world
The most beautiful star in the world, 'tisn't Garbo
T'sn't Dietrich, but a sweet trick
Who can make me believe it's a beautiful world
Social? Not a bit! Natural kind of wit
She'd shine anywhere, and she hasn't got platinum hair
The most beautiful house in the world has a mortgage
What do I care? It's "Good-bye, care"
When my slippers are next to the ones that belong
To the one and only beautiful girl in the world


Social? Not a bit! She's got a natural kind of wit.
And I tell ya, she'd shine anywhere, and she hasn't got platinum hair
The most beautiful house in the world, it has a mortgage
What do I care? It's "Good-bye, care"
When my slippers are next to the ones that belong
To the one and only beautiful girl
The one and only beautiful girl
The one and only beautiful girl in the world
