Without a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong a man ain't got a friend
Without a song


That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no how
Without a song

I got my trouble and woe but, sure as i know, the jordan
Will roll
And i'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul

I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes that grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
Without a song

&lt;instrumental&gt;

I've a got my trouble and woe and, sure as i know, the jordan
Will roll
And i'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul


I'll-a never know what makes that rain to fall
I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
