You promised me love
That would never die
That promise you've made
Was only a lie


Now after you've gone
All alone I've pined
For all that I've got
Was a worried mind

I gave you a ring
I gave you a home
You promised me love
That you'd never wrong

I bought you fine clothes
And I bought you wine
But all that I got
Was a worried mind

And when I was down
You've just left me there
I needed you so
But you didn't care

You found a new love
And a home so fine
But all that I've got
Is a worried mind
