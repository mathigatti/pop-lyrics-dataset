Lord have mercy, lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, lord have mercy on me
Well if I've done somebody wrong, lord, have mercy if you
Please


I used to have plenty of money, the finest clothes in town
But bad luck and trouble overtaken me, bound to get me down
Please have mercy, lord have mercy on me
Well if I've done somebody wrong, lord, have mercy if you
Please

Keep on working now, child
Lord every morning

Well if I've been a bad boy, baby, I declare I'll change my
Ways
I don't want bad luck and trouble to follow me all my days
Please have mercy, lord have mercy on me
Well if I've done somebody wrong, lord, have mercy if you
Please
