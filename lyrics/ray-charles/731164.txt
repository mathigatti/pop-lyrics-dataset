[Betty Carter]
You can haunt any house by yourself
Be a man or a mouse by yourself
You can act like a king on a throne
There are lots of things that you can do alone
But it takes...


[Both]
Two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Two to tango, two to tango
Do the dance of love

[Ray Charles]
You can sail on a ship by yourself
Take a nap or a nip by yourself
You can get into bed on your own
There are lots of things that you can do alone
I said....

[Both]
Two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Two to tango, two to tango
Do the dance of love

[Betty Carter]
You can get buried all by yourself
Catch a fish or a cold by yourself
Dig a ditch, strike it rich all by yourself
There are lots of things that you can do alone
But it takes...

[Both]
Two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Two to tango, two to tango
Do the dance of love

[Ray Charles]
You can fight like a champ by yourself
You can lick any stamp by yourself
You can be very brave on the phone
There are lots of things that you can do alone
I said it takes...

[Both]
Two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Two to tango, two to tango
Do the dance of love

It takes two, I said two
Darling it always takes two,
I'm with you!
