Just because you're near
The cold nights grow warmer
Heaven's not so far away
Whisper in my ear
Gentle is the darkness
Keep your secrets here


Girl then dream on
Then dream on
Dream that all the world's an actor in your play
It can all go your way

Then dream on
Yeah, dream on
Dream that all of this magnificence is yours
It will never slip away

Just because you're near
Memories grow fonder
I wonder through them like a child
My arms thrown open wide
Innocent and trusting
Come lay here by my side

Girl then dream on
Then dream on
Dream that all the world's an actor in your play
It can all go your way

Then dream on
Yeah, dream on
Dream that all of this magnificence is yours
It will never slip away

Just because you're near
Nothing seems to matter
Just the softness of your hair
Let it all in here
Gentle is the darkness
Filled with your perfume

Girl then dream on
Then dream on
Dream that all the world's an actor in your play
It can all go your way

Girl dream on
Hey, dream on
Dream that all of this magnificence is yours
It will never slip away
