There's a reason
For the sunshine day,
There's a reason
Why I'm feelin' so high.
Must be the season
When that love light shines all around us.
So let that feeling
Grad you deep inside
And send you reeling
Where your love can't hide
And then go stealing
Throught the summer nights
With your lover.
Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean
It's the season.
Let your love fly
Like a bird on the wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things,
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean,
That's the reason.
There's a reason
For the warm sweet nights
There's a reason
For the candle lights.
Must be the season
When those love rites shine all around us.
So let the wonder
Take you into space
And lay you under
Its loving embrace
Feel the thunder
As it warms your face
You can't hold back.
Ust let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean
It's the season.
Let your love fly
Like a bird on the wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things,
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean,
That's the reason.
