Well, you treat me just like dirt
And you think that it doesn't hurt
You say I look so funny
Every time you put me down


You say I even look funny
When I cry
But you're in for a big surprise

Whoa, baby, now
You're just about to lose your clown
(About to lose your clown)

What you gonna do
(What you gonna do)
What you gonna say
(What you gonna say)

Without your funny man
To pick on night and day
Hey, hey

Well, you're cheating
And treating me cruel
Making me your personal fool
First, you build me up and
Then you bring me tumbling down

You say I even look funny
When I'm blue
But, baby, I've got news for you

Whoa, I tell you now
You're just about to lose your clown
(About to lose your clown)

What you gonna do
(What you gonna do)
What you gonna say
(What you gonna say)

Without your funny man
To pick on night and day now

You say I even look funny
When I cry
But you're in for a big surprise

Yeah, I'm trying to tell you now
You're just about to lose your clown
(About to lose your clown)

You're gonna lose your clown now
(About to lose your clown)
Whoa, you're gonna lose me, babe
(About to lose your clown)

What you gonna do
(About to lose your clown)
What you gonna say
(About to lose your clown)...
