If you go away on this summer day,
Then you might as well take the sun away;
All the birds that flew in the summer sky,
When our love was new and our hearts were high;
When the day was young and the night was long,
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song.
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.


If you go, as i know you will, you must tell the world to stop turning
Till you return again, if you ever do, for what good is love
Without loving you,
Can i tell you now, as you turn to go, i'll be dying slowly till the next hello,
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.

But if you stay, i'll make you a night
Like no night has been, or will be again.
I'll sail on your smile, i'll ride on your touch,
I'll talk to your eyes that i love such.
But if you go, go, i won't cry,
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye,
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.

If you go away, as i know you must,
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust,
Just an empty room, full of empty space,
Like the empty look i see on your face.
I'd have been the shadow of your dog
If i thought it might have kept me by your side.
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
