Well, i know you are a playboy
And you've got women all over town
But listen buddy if you ever sweet-talk my little girl
I'm gonna lay your body down

And you've got a new fifty-six too
But if i ever see my little girl in your new car
I'm gonna do some work on you.

You know you don't want, oh yeah (get in trouble)
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)

So i don't want to start a fight
So if you'll take heed and stay away from my little girl
Then everything will be alright
