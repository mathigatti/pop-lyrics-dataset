If you loved me half as much as I love you
You couldn't worry me half as much you do
You're so nice to me when there's no one else around
But you only build me up to take me down


But if you missed me half as much as I miss you
You couldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I could never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you

I know that I could never be this blue
If you only love me half as much as I love you
