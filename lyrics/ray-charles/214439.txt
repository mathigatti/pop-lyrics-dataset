If you beg a date
She says, "You're too late"
Then later, she gives you a call
Don't hesitate, you're in for a break
'Cause Jack, she's on the ball


If she winks at you
Don't you miss that cue
For this is no time for a stall
Man, call a hack, and get to your shack
'Cause Jack, she's on the ball

No use in her denying
You don't have to do much trying
Just remember this, when she gives you her kiss
Her heart, and soul, are pining

So remember Gates
It's never too late
If ever she starts 'n to stall
Just bait your trap, she'll fall just like that
'Cause Jack, she's on the ball



(solos)

No use in her denying
You don't have to do much trying
'Cause remember this, if she gives you her kiss
Her heart, and soul, are pining

So remember-gate
It's never too late
Whenever she starts 'n to stall
Just bait your trap, she'll fall just like that
'Cause Jack, she's on the ball
Mm, Jack, she's on the ball
(I'm tellin' you buddy)
Jack, she's on the ball
(Of course, if she's fine it's understood that)
