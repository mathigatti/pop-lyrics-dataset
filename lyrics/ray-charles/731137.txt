Somethings gotta give,
Somethings gotta give
Somethings gotta give
When an irresistible force such as you
Meets and old immovable object like me
You can bet as sure as you live
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
Something's gotta give.
When an irrepressible smile such as yours
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist.
Somewhere, somehow,
Someone's gonna be kissed.
So en garde who knows what the fates have in store
From their vast mysterious sky?
I'll try hard ignoring those lips I adore
But how long can anyone try?
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might,
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
We'll find out as sure as we live
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
Something's gotta give.
Fight, fight, fight it with all of our might,
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
We'll find out as sure as we live
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
Something's gotta give.
Something's gotta, something's gotta give
