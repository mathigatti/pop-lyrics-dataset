Hooray for Hollywood, that screwy, bally hooey Hollywood.
Where any office boy or young mechanic can be a panic with just a
Looking pan.
And any barmaid can be a star maid if she dances with or without a fan.
Hooray for Hollywood where you're terrific if you're even good.
Where anyone at all from Shirley Temple to Aimee Semple is equally
Understood,
Go out and try your luck, you might be Donald Duck! Hooray for
Hollywood.
Hooray for Hollywood, that phony super Coney, Hollywood.
They come from Chillicothes and Paducahs with their bazookas to get
Their
Names up in lights.
All armed with photos from local Rotos with their hair in ribbons and
Legs in
Tights.
Hooray for Hollywood, you may be homely in your neighborhood,
But if you think you can be an actor, see Mr. Factor, he'd make a monkey
Look
Good.
Within a half an hour, you look like Tyrone Power! Hooray for Hollywood!
