Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of May
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play
They say "Emily, Emily, Emily"
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see dreamily, Emily


Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see dreamily, Emily
