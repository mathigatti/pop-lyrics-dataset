What a lovely trip, I'm feeling so fresh and alive
And I'm so glad to arrive, it's all so grand
It's easy to see you don't need a palace
To feel like Alice in Wonderland
Back in Ohio where I come from
I've done a lot of dreamin' and I've travelled some
But I never thought I'd see the day
When I ever took a ride on the Santa Fe
(wanna take a ride on the Santa Fe)
I would lean across my window sill
And hear the whistle echoin' across the hill
Then I'd watch the lights till they fade away
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe
What a thrill (what a great big wonderful thrill)
With the wheels a-singin' "westward ho"
Right from the day I heard them start
'Cross the Kansas plains from New Mexico
I guess I've got a little gypsy in my heart
When I'm old and grey and settled down
If I ever get a chance to sneak away from town
Then I'll spend my busman's holiday
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe
All aboard! (we came across the country lickety-split)
(rollin' ninety miles an hour), I can't believe I'm here at last
Woo-oo-ooo! (when you go travellin', it's best for you
To take the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!)
I can't believe that anything could go so fast
Then you pull that throttle, whistle blows
A-huffin' and a-puffin' and away she goes
All aboard for California, hey!


On the Atchison (on the Atchison)
On the Atchison, Topeka (on the Atchison, Topeka)
On the Atchison, Topeka (on the Atchison, Topeka)
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
