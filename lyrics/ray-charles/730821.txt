Don't you feel the thrill of something
Something, something in the air?


Your eyes entice
I mean they're nice.
I admire your dress, your perfume
And the way you dress your hair!
That's where it ends!
I mean we're friends!

Give her a kiss
Face the issue,
Give her a kiss
Make her kiss you
She'll adore it-
Thank you for it.
Give her a kiss
Why have you lips?
Give her a kiss
Press those two lips.
She's so lovely-
Give her a kiss
Take the lady by storm
You know you can
She'll reply with a warm
"Man, you're my man"
How can you miss?
She will soften,
Chances like this
Don't come often.
Now or never
Give her a kiss.
Take the lady by storm
You know you can
She'll reply with a warm
"Man, you're my man"
How can you miss?
You can make it,
Give her a kiss.
She can take it,
Now or never
Give her a kiss.
