I put a spell on you because you're mine
You had better stop the things that you do
I ain't lying, no I ain't lying
I just can't stand it babe
The way you're always running round
I just can't stand it
The way you always put me down
I put a spell on you because you're mine, you're mine,
you'remine
I put a spell on you because you're mine


You had better stop the things that you do
Lord knows I ain't lying, no no no I ain't lying
I just can't stand it
The way you always put me down
I just can't stand it
The way you always run round
I put a spell on you because you're mine, you're mine,
you'remine

I love you, I love you, oh anyhow
I don't care if you don't want me, I'm yours anyhow
I put a spell on you because you're mine
Because you're mine, you're mine, because you're mine
