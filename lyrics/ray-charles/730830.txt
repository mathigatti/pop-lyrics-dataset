I was as cold as the bear called polar
My flame was never fanned,
And since the day when I first cut a molar,
I never held a hand!
But you looked me in the eye,
And my temp'rature went sky-high!
One glance at you and I knew that I looked
As if we two were booked!


When I met you my love called out "Hello!"
Did you shout "Hello!" too?
Something inside me clicked and cried "How do!"
Yours replied "How do!" too.
I was so excited,
Never stopped to talk,
While my feet invited
Your feet for a walk!
When my heart and your heart beat the same tattoo,
It is tit for tat too!

I guess I once must have done something awful
And so God gave me you!
Of notes of boys who propose, I've a drawer full,
I've never read them through.
You gave me the sheepish look,
Now I'm studying a cookbook.
Love may be blind, but with pride,
I decide to be a dumbbell's bride!

When I met you my love called out "Hello!"
Did you shout "Hello!" too?
Something inside me clicked and cried "How do!"
Yours replied "How do!" too.
I was so excited,
Never stopped to talk,
While my feet invited
Your feet for a walk!
When my heart and your heart beat the same tattoo,
It is tit for tat too!
