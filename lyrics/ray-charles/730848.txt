I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande
And my legs ain't bowed, my cheeks ain't tanned
I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow
Never roped a steer 'cause I don't know how
And I sure ain't fixin' to start in now
Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay, Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay
I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande
And I learned to ride 'fore I learned to stand
I'm a riding fool who is up to date
I know every trail in the Lone Star state
'cause I ride the range in a Ford V-8
Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay


And I come to town just to hear the band
I know all the songs that the cowboys know
'bout the big corral where the dogies go
'cause I learned them all on the radio
Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay
Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay
Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay
