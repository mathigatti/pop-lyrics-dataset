Whoa, I'm so lonesome baby, now
I am in a travelin' mood, yes I am
Whoa, I'm so lonesome now now, honey
I tell ya I am in a travelin' mood, um hm


Guess I'll have to hop a freight to California
Cause I've got the travelin' blues, yes I have

Sometime I feel like walkin', now now
Well I have no walkin' shoes, no, no
Well, sometime I feel like walkin', now now
I tell you I got no walkin' shoes, do you believe me

That's why I've got to hop a freight to California
Cause I've got the travelin' blues, um hm

Cause I keep drifting and drifting,
Like a ship out on the sea.
I keep drifting and drifting, now
Like a ship out on the sea, well
You see I ain't got no, nobody,
In this world to care for me.

If my baby, if my baby
Would only take me back again.
Oh now if my baby now
Uh, would only take me back again.
Well I may not be good for nothing, baby
But you see I haven't got no friends.

Play it, son
{guitar solo}

I'll give you all my money, now
Tell me what more can I do, I wanna know
(just give some more, just give some more, just give some more)
I'll give you all my money, little girl
tell me what more can I do, I've got to know
(just give some more, just give some more, just give some more)
Well you may be a good little girl sometime
But you just won't be true

Bye-bye baby, now
Baby, bye-bye bye-bye
(bye baby, bye-bye baby)
Bye-bye baby, now
Baby, bye-bye bye-bye
(bye baby, bye-bye baby)

Well it's too late to worry, I want you to know
I said, oh, it's too late to cry
