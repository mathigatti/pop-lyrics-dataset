Candy, I call my sugar Candy, because I'm sweet on Candy, and Candy's sweet on me
She understands me, my understanding Candy, and Candy's always handy
When I need sympathy, I wish that there were four of her,
So I could love much more of her.
She has taken my complete heart, got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
Candy, it's gonna be just dandy, the day I take my Candy
And make her mine, all mine.
