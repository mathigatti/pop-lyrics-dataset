Baby let me hold your hand
Until I make you understand
Ohh, baby, baby let me hold your hand
I really believe, everything will sure be grand


Baby I want you by my side
Our love we could never hide
Ohh, baby, baby I want you by my side
Well you know pretty baby, our love we would never hide

Baby I'll buy you a diamond ring
Cadillac and everything
Then baby, I'm gonna buy you a house in style
Then I'll live there forever, yes lord with my little wife and
child
