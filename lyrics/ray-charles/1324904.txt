Little girls and little boys
Dream of worlds full of toys
This time of the year
When Christmas is near


Oh, evergreens are snowy white
Sleigh bells ring through the night
This time of the year
When Christmas is near

And somewhere near a steeple
People kneel and pray
And choirs sing carols
Of Christmas Day

Yes, Santa Claus is on his way
With loads of joy on his sleigh
This time of the year
When Christmas is near

Santa Claus is on his way
With loads of joy on his sleigh
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
