Oh Lord I feel fine today
I'm walking on cloud nine today
I'm over that line today
Happiness is finally mine today


I guess I'm just a lucky guy
And I'm prepared to tell you why
It's strictly on account of my
Sweet Potato Pie

I'm the fellow that she loves the most
The main reason why she left the coast
She's my little girlziña
That much hotter that a jalapeño

Tender like a night in June
Sweeter than a honeymoon
Brighter than a silver spoon
Just as crazy as a loon

Softer than a lullabye
Deeper than the midnight sky
Soulful as a baby's cry
My Sweet Potato Pie

I used to see her around the neighborhood
I wonder how she grew up so good
She belonged to Freddy and he was bad
And I never was ready to make him mad

I'm glad I had to wait awhile
A little bit too juvenile
I needed to refine my style
A silk suit and a crocodile smile

So let the whole damn world go by
'Cause I just want to testify
From now on it's me and my
Sweet Potato Pie
