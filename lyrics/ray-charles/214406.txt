Love makes me treat you the way that i do
Baby, ain't i good to you
Nothing in this world too good for a girl so good and true
Whoa, baby, ain't i good to you


I bought you a fur coat for christmas
And a diamond ring, yes i did
And a big cadillac car, and everything

What makes me treat you the way that i do
It must be love baby
That's why i'm so good to you

I bought you a fur coat for christmas
And a diamond ring,
And a great big eldorado, and everything

It must be love that makes me treat you the way that i do
Gee,
Baby ain't i good to you
