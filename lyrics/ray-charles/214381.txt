I know you told me
Such a long time ago
That you didn't want me
You didn't love me no more


I want to know
Oh, what makes me be
Do you believe me child
A fool for you
Ohoh, no, i'm a fool for you

I know you told me
You didn't want me `round
And i know
You got a man way `cross town

So i know it's something
Oh, what makes me be
Do you believe me child
I'm a fool for you
Ohoh, no, i'm a fool for you

Did ya ever wake up in the morning
Just about the break of day
Reach over and feel the pillow
Where your baby used to lay
Then you put on your crying
Like you never cried before
Oh lord
Yeah you even cry so loud,
You give the blues to your neighbor next door
Ever since you were five years old
I been a fool for you, little girl
Way down in my soul
I'm a little fool for ya

So i know it's something
Oh, oh, lord
