I'll do a dance that's very far from easy
But make it look as simple as Parcheesi.
When you get tired
And your labor irks,
Just look inspired
And show the dental works.


When you have to dance a mile
How the hell can ladies smile!

This goes up! That goes up!
Turn nose up! Smile!
No pouting! No doubting!
I'm shouting! Smile!
Tho' work may be real serious,
Smile until you're delirious.
Hey, hey, foot! Hey straw foot!
Lift your foot! Smile.
