The other night
As I lay sleeping
Whoah, I dreamed I held you
Held you in my arms
Well, but when I woke up this morning
I found out I was mistaken
Do you know that I hung my
I hung my head and cried


Whoah you are my sunshine
(you are my sunshine)
Ohh, my only sunshine
(my only sunshine)
Well, little girl you make me happy sometimes
(you make me happy)
When my skies are grey
(when skies are grey)
Umm, you'll never never never know dear
(you'll never know, dear)
How much I love you
(how much I love you)
Whoa, and I don't want you to take
(don't take my sunshine)
My sunshine away
(shine away)

{instrumental interlude}

 You told me once, dear,
 That you really loved me
 And no one else
 could ever come between, yeah
 But now you left me and you love another, yeah
 And you have shattered, oh yeah
 All of my dreams

Whoah you are my sunshine
(you are my sunshine)
Ohh, my only sunshine
(my only sunshine)
Ohh, you make me happy sometimes
(you make me happy)
When my skies are grey
(when skies are grey)
Whoa, you'll never never never know dear
(you'll never know, dear)
How much I love you
(how much I love you)
Whoa, and I don't want you to take
(don't take my sunshine)
Whoa, if you love me
(don't take my sunshine)
Umm-hmm, if you need me
(don't take my sunshine)
Uh-huh if you want me
(don't take my sunshine)
Waaaahh! Listen
(don't take my sunshine)
(don't take my sunshine)
I don't want you to take
(don't take my sunshine)
Waaaahh! Listen
(don't take my sunshine)
(don't take my sunshine)
I don't want you to take
(don't take my sunshine)
Whoah, my sunshine away
