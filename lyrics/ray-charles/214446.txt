Wella, oh yeah
Wella, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah


Do you know that this little girl of mine
I want you people to know
This little girl of mine
I take her everywhere i go

One day i looked at my suit
My suit was new
I looked at my shoes
And they were too

And that's why i, i, i, i,
Oh, i love that little girl of mine

Oh do you know that this little girl of mine
Makes me happy when i'm sad
This little girl of mine
Loves me, even when i'm bad

She knows how to love me right down to her teeth
If she does any wrong, you know she keeps it from me

And that's why i, i, i, i,
Oh, i love that little girl of mine

(bridge)

Do you know that this little girl of mine
Called me last night about eight
This little girl of mine
Told me that we had a date

She said that she'd meet me at a quarter to nine
Believe it or not, but she was right on time

And that's why i, i, i, i,
Oh, i love that little girl of mine

Do you know that this little girl of mine
Knows how to dress so neat
This little girl of mine
Stops the traffic on the street

When the fellas start whistling, well i don't mind
I can't blame them, `cause she is fine

And that's why i, i, i, i,
Oh, i love that little girl of mine

And that's why i, i, i, i,
