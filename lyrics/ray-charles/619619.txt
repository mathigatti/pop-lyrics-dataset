Don't decieve me
Please don't leave me
What would I do without you
To see me through


If you leave me
Then you'll grieve me
What would I do without you
To see me through

What would I do
Say I wanna know
What would I do
Where would I go

How you please me
When you squeeze me
What would I do without you
To see me through

What would I do
I wanna know
What would I do
Where would I go

Yes I'm crazy
About my baby (yes I am)
What would I do without you
To see me through
