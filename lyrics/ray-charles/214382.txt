A sentimental blues
Will worry you
And make you do
Things that you
Wouldn't do
Only when you
Hear these blues


A sentimental blues
Will wet your eye
You wonder why
You heave a sigh
You start to cry
Each time that you
Hear these blues

Sigh, sigh, sigh
And drool
Cry, cry, cry
You fool
Yes, I know that it's cool

A sentimental blues
Deep down inside
Will make you hide
Your foolish pride
A sentimental blues
Will make you lose
Your mind

{solos}

Sigh, sigh, sigh
And drool
Cry, cry, cry
You fool
Yes, I know that it's cool

A sentimental blues
Deep down inside
Will make you hide
Your foolish pride
A sentimental blues
Will make you lose
