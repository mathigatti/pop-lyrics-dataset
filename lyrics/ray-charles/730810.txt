Drinkin' again and thinkin' of when, when you loved me
I'm havin' a few and wishin' that you were here
Makin' the rounds, accepting a round from strangers
Bein' a fool just hopin' that you'll appear
Sure, I can borrow a smoke, maybe tell some joker a bad joke
But nobody laughs, they don't laugh at a broken heart
Oh, yeah, I'm drinkin' again, it's always the same
That same old story
After the kicks there's little old mixed-up me
Tryin' to lose a dream that used to be
Look at me, I'm drinkin' again, drinkin' all over town
Yeah, I'm drinkin' again
