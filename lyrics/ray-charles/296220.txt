Ellie, My Love

There were times I left your heart in pain
Time again I've turned and walked away
I get to where I'm going just to find
Won't be happy in this world
If you're not by my side
Ellie, my love so sweet


My heart told me to break away
Now I'm out here far away
Wish that I could hold you in the night
Then I'd wake up to a morning 
That is warm and bright
Ellie, my love so sweet

Smile for me, won't you, baby
Forever you'll be on my mind
Drink with me won't you baby
We're gonna make it right this time
There's no one else like you
Anything you want, I'll do
Ellie, my love so sweet
Ellie, my love so sweet

My heart told me to break away
Now I'm here so far away
Wish that I could hold you in the night
Then I'd wake up to a morning 
That is warm and bright
Ellie, my love so sweet

Smile for me, won't you, baby
Forever you'll be on my mind
Drink with me won't you baby
We're gonna make it right this time
There's no one else like you
Anything you want, I'll do
Ellie, my love so sweet
Ellie, my love so sweet

Smile for me, won't you, baby
Forever you'll be on my mind
Drink with me won't you baby
We're gonna make it right this time
There's no one else like you
Anything you want, I'll do
Ellie, my love so sweet
Ellie, my love so sweet
