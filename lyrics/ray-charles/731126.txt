Horace was a poet who adored the night;
In his verse he always underscored the night.
I recall what Horace said in Latin
A -"Never make your love affair a matinee!"
Wait till after dark for the classic spark.


Quiet night
And all around the calm and boring weather;
Quiet night
No other sound, but hearts that beat together
You can almost hear the things I'm thinking;
You can almost see my heart take flight...
Whisper low but don't say "No"
It's such a quiet night!
