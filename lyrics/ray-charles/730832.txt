Hey girl, I want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go
Hey girl, I'll tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me's going to die
If you say so long, if this is goodbye


Hey girl, this can't be true
How am I supposed to exist without you?
Hey girl, don't put me on
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone?
How will I live, how can I go on?
How can I go on?

Hey girl, now sit yourself down
I'm not afraid to get down on the ground
And beg you, beg you to stay
Don't go away
Hey girl
