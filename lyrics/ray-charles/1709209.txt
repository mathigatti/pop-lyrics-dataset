Sometimes when I'm sad and all alone
just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
All I ever need is you now


Your my first love, your my last
Your my future, your my past
Loving you is all I ask, ohh
All I ever need is you

Winters come and then they go
And we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you

Some men follow rainbows I am told
Some men search for silver, some for gold
I found my treasures in your soul
All I ever need is you baby

Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every day
I won't sleep at night until you say
Ohh Babe, all I ever need is you

Some men follow rainbows I am told
Some men search for silver, some for gold
I found my treasures in your soul
All I ever need is you baby

Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every day
I won't sleep at night until you say
Ohh, all I ever need is you
I wanna hear you say
All I ever need is you babe
All I ever need is you
All I ever need is you
All I ever need is you
