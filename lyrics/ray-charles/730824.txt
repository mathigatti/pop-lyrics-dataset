Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer.
Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer.
Lead us lest too far we wander.
Love's sweet voice is calling yonder.
Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer.
Hey, there don't get dimmer, dimmer.
Light the path below, above.
And lead us on to love!


Glow little glow-worm, fly of fire.
Glow like an incandescent wire.
Glow for the female of the species.
Turn on the AC and the DC.
This night could use a little brightnin'.
Light up you little ol' bug of lightnin'.
When you gotta glow, you gotta glow.

Glow little glow-worm, glow.
Glow little glow-worm, glow and glimmer.
Swim through the sea of night, little swimmer.
Thou aeronautical boll weevil.
Illuminate yon woods primeval.
See how the shadows deepen, darken.
You and your chick should get to sparkin'.
I got a gal that I love so.

Glow little glow-worm, glow.
Glow little glow-worm, turn the key on.
You are equipped with taillight neon.
You got a cute vest-pocket mazda.
Which you can make both slow and faster.
I don't know who you took a shine to.
Or who you're out to make a sign to.
I got a gal that I love so.
Glow little glow-worm, glow.
