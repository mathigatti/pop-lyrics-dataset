Hey everybody,
Let's have some fun
You only live but once
And when you're dead you're done


So let the good times roll,
I said let the good times roll,
I don't care if you're young or old,
You oughtta get together and let the good times roll

Don't sit there mumbling
Talkin' trash
If you want to have a ball,
You got to go out and spend some cash

And let the good times roll now,
I'm talkin' `bout the good times,
Well it makes no difference whether you're young or old,
All you got to do is get together and let the good times roll

Hey y'all tell everybody, Ray Charles in town,
I got a dollar and a quarter and I'm just ringing the clock,
But don't let no female, play me cheap,
I got fifty cents more than I'm gonna keep.

So let the good times roll now,
I tell y'all I'm gonna let the good times roll now,
Well it don't make no difference if you're young or old,
All you got to do is get together and let the good times roll

Hey no matter whether, rainy weather,
If you want to have a ball, you got to get yourself together,
