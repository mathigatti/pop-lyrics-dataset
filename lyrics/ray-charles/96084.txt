Ohhhh, I was lying in the bed with fever
And I was, burning up inside
My baby walked, in my bedroom
And I could hardly open my eyes


She said that she was going to the pawnshop
Just across the track
She started packing some clothes in a hurry
And then she said she would be right back

But I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah
Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since she went away
I remember so well when she slammed the door
But the girl didn't make it back no more
I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day

Well, I waited for 24 hours, and I was just about to starve to death
It didn't look like she was comin' back, so I had to look out for myself
Well I called, the police department, to find out what they knew
They said, "No, by heck, but we will get her yet", because they was lookin' for her too

Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah
Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since she went away
Well I don't know what happened a-cross the track
But I know my baby didn't make it back
I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day

(instrumental break)

Well I called, my Dr. Foster, and when the girl answered the phone
I got a funny feeling, the way she said Dr. Foster had gone
She said, "He left with a lady patient, about 24 hours ago"
I added two and two, and here's what I got: I got I'll never see that girl no more

Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah
But I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since she went away
If Dr. Foster has got her, then I know I'm through
Because he's got medicine and, money too
I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day

Whoaah, no
