1) ( i need someone to say i do  )

No one to cry to now , no one to say goodnight

No one to tell my troubles to

2) ive got no one , to sigh to , no one to hold me
Tight


No one to chear me when im blue

*  when i go home to my lonely room

And find thereç£- no one there

And each night i think of you , so please answer this
One prayer

3) and youç£l need someone , i said to cry to

Someone to say i do

Someone to whisper i love you

( raelletes ) repeat

3 ) repeat
