The stars at night are big and bright, X X X X
Deep In the Heart of Texas


The Prairie Sky, is Wide and High, X X X X 
Deep In the Heart of Texas

The Sage in bloom is like perfume, X X X X 
Deep in the Heart of Texas

Reminds me of the one I love, X X X X 
Deep in the Heart of Texas

The Coyotes wail along the trail, X X X X 
Deep in the Heart of Texas

The rabbits rush around the brush
Deep in the Heart of Texas

The cowboys cry, "Ki-yip-pee Yi"  X X X X
Deep in the Heart of Texas

The Dogies bawl, and bawl and bawl X X X X 
Deep In the Heart of Texas
