Your lips they come and kiss me
And they haven`t made a sound
Your hips they`re coming with me
And you`re just comin round


My heart beats like thunder
Every time you come into view
This thing is bigger than both of us
II know you know it too
We got a big, big, big bad love

We fit like a hand in a glove
We got a big, big, big bad love
Big bad love

Everything you want and need
You can have a bat and ball
My time, my love, my credit card
I`ll even drive you to the store

Got a list of things to do baby
And it`s very short and sweet
I`ll begin at the beginning
And I`ll end up at your feet
We got a big, big, big bad love
Bad love

We fit like a hand in a glove
We got a big, big, big bad love

In the morning when I wake up
I can`t believe my luck
I take you like a vitamin pill
And you drive me like a truck

I don`t care where you go baby
Don`t care what you do
Just as long as you take me there
And let me do it with you
We got a big, big, big bad love
We got a big, big, big bad love
We got a big, big, big bad love

Let me tell you now
We fit like a hand in a glove
We got a big, big bad love
Big bad love
Bad love
Big bad love
Bad love
We got a big bad love

You say that to all the girls Ray!
