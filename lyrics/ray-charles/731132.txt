Simpatica
One look in your eyes and I knew you
Touching your hand bound me to you
You understand, for you are simpatica.
Simpatica
You don't have to talk to inspire me
Don't have to say you desire me
Day after day you are so simpatica.
You speak and it's the sweetest music
I have ever heard
You taught me how to live again
The day you taught me
That single word
Simpatica
I know that our love must be deathless.
Your little kiss leave me breathless
You must know this if you are simpatica
And you are so
Simpatica!
