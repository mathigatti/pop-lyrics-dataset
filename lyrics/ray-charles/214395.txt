You know I'm hooked for you, mama
That's why you sling your weight around
You know I'm hooked for you, mama
That's why you sling your weight around


Aw, but as long as your
Loving beats your arguing
Little girl, I'll never put you down

You argue when I leave for work
You argue when I get home
Everything I try to do for you
You always say that I'm wrong

I bring you home all my money
Except for the little I keep for expense
And when I get to home to you, mama
You always tell me, Ray
You ain't go no sense

But on the other hand, baby
You, I can't understand
Aw, but when you put your
Loving arms around me, honey
You make me forget about everything

I think about the
Lousy way you treat me
You're always raising sin
