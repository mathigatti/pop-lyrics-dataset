Lover, when I'm near you, and I hear you, speak my name
Softly, in my ear you, breathe a flame
Lover, when we're dancing, keep on glancing, in my eyes
Till loves own entrancing, music dies
All of my future is in you
Your every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine
Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart


Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel, with our bliss
When, two lips of coral, want to kiss
I say the devil is in you, and to resist you, I try
But if you didn't continue, I would die
Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart
