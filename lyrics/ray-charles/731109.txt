From moment to moment every moment that I live
I live for every moment with you
To see you, to touch you, to imagine this will be
The moment when a dream comes true
Just an ordinary day becomes adventure
Such sweet adventure I never knew


And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of
The miracle that love can do
From moment to moment with you

And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of
The miracle that love can do
From moment to moment with you
