I wonder what you're dreaming while you're sleeping.
I'll never know.
You'll never know.
Now at last the world cannot come peeping
Into the thoughts you call your own.
You close your eyes and you're alone.
You're in a world that' s bright and new
And there is no one in it but you.


Comfy and cozy,
All the world is rosy.
Ev'rybody loves you when you're asleep.
Too late to start now
Taking things apart now.
Ev'rybody loves you when you're asleep.

You forget
Your alphabet
When you've been counting sheep
Does my dreamer know troubles will keep?
Comfy and cozy
All the world is rosy.
Ev'rybody loves you
When you're asleep.
