Together again
My tears have stopped fallin
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end
The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together  again


Together again
The grey skies are gone
You're back in my arms
Now where you belong
The love that we knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters, Baby
We're together again

Well, nothing  else matters, Baby
