Love makes me treat you the way that I do
Baby, ain't I good to you
Nothing in this world too good for a girl so good and true
Whoa, baby, ain't I good to you


I bought you a fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring, yes I did
And a big Cadillac car, and everything

What makes me treat you the way that I do
It must be love baby
That's why I'm so good to you

(bridge)

I bought you a fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring,
And a great big Eldorado, and everything

It must be love that makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee,
Baby ain't I good to you
