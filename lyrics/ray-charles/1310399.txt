The news is out, all over town 
That you've been seen, a-runnin' round 
I know that I should leave but then 
I just can't go, you win again 


This heart of mine could never see 
What everybody knew but me 
Just trusting you was my great sin 
What can I do, you win again 

I'm sorry for your victim now
'Cause soon his head like mine will bow 
You'll use his heart, but all in vain 
And someday say, you win again 

You have no heart, you have no shame 
You take true love and give the blame 
I guess that I should not complain 
I love you still, you win again
