Can you tell me, is there anyone out there
Can you hear me, calling you
If you hear, will you listen
Is that too much to ask you to do
I've been searching for someone to care
Ooh  Lord   is there anyone out there



Will you help me, I need someone to talk to
A brother who I can rely on
Whose not hard to relate to
No, I don't need a shoulder to cry on
All I need is someone with sometime to spare
Yeah, I just ask  is there anyone out there


CHORUS

Woow if I sing, will you sing, will you sing out with me
Cause I'm down
I don't think there's no way to be
So, if you there, will you answer, answer all my call
Tell me, is there anyone out there at all
Com' on  and help me
Is there anyone out there
Can you give me, a moment or two
Take the time out to meet me
All, I wanna do, please is lay some good friendship on you
I got so much I wanna share, I wanna share
Is there anyone out there


Chorus

If, I sing, will you sing, will you sing out with me
Cause I'm down
Lord there's no way to be
Yes if you there, will you answer, answer all my call
Lord is there anyone out there at all
Please help me, Lord I need someone to talk to
Like a brother who I can rely on
Yeah ... whose not hard to relate to
I don't need a shoulder to cry on
All I need is someone with just a little time to spare
Lord have mercy
