There's a great big town
On a great big lake
Called Chicago.
When the sun goes down
It is wide awake.
Take your ma and your pa,
Go to Chicago.
Boston is England
N'Orleans is France,
New York is anyone's
For ten cents a dance
But This great big town
On a great big lake
Is America's first
And Americans make
Chicago.
Hi ya boys.
