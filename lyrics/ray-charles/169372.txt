When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin'else
He'd trade the world
For a good time he's found


If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd given up all his comfort
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

When a man loves a woman
I give you everything i've got (yeah)
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'cause, baby, baby, baby
I am a man
When a man loves a woman (repeat...)
