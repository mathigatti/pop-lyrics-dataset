When i got misery , oh my where are you , honey
Honey , oh honey honey , where can you be


Whisperin when the lights are low , to each
Teardrop on my pillow

Honey honey , honey honey , where are you

I crossed the scalds in dessert , just to be where
You are

I want you need you love you , but still weç£-e apart

When i want to hold you , oh my where are you

Honey honey , my honey honey , where can you be
