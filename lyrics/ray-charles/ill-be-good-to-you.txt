I want to know, baby
Just how you feel, girl
Said I wanna know
If what you feel is real, girl

`Cause there's a reason
For the things that I say, what I talk about
But oh, I wanna love ya girl
In a special way, come `ere woman

We've been together, for so very long
I'd hate to break up, break up my happy home

(The way we stand and the way we lie)
The way we lie
(The way we love and the way we cry)
Girl, we cry
(Of all these things, there comes a time)
There's a time
(Makes me feel that it's worth a try)
Makes me feel
(I'll be good to you)

(Good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya)

Girl you said, we've been together
So very long, very long
I would hate to break up, break up my happy home
Let me take off your shoes
Take a stand, now, and let me know how
Oooh always, baby always, and all your know-how, baby

(The way we stand and the way we lie)
Um-hum the way we lie
(The way we love and the way we cry)
The wa-ay-ay-ay, we cry
(Of all these things, there comes a time)
Oooo
(Makes me feel that it's worth a try)
Oooo
(I'll be good to you, good to ya, good to ya)
I'll be good
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya)

(Good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
{I'll be good}
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya, good to ya)
{So good, to you}
(I'll be good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
{I'll be good}
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya)
{So good, to you}

Girl, I'll be good to you, baby
Y'know I'll be good to you
Take you shopping, you know what I mean baby, anything you want
I'll be good to you
I'll give it up, with my credit cards,
Like Visa, MasterCharge, American Express,
Turn my pants upside down
Any day of the week
Ow-oh, you, you, you
Come here, give me love
Talk to me

(Good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
Girl I'll be good to you
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
I'll be good to you
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya)
I'll be good to you, I said I will, I ain't lying, baby
Oooo-hoo

(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya, good to ya)
{So good, to you}
Girl, I'll be good to you
