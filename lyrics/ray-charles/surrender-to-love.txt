Surrender To Love lyrics

Ray:
Sometimes we had to be like a warrior in battle
Fighting all our fears
To many wounded hearts keep filling up the fidges
And nearly disappear


Laura:
But I still can't believe it
You dream of the day
We can freely give our love away, away
Why stay the way we are it hasn't worked so far
It's a new day, what if we all could say:
Surrender to love.
Surrender to love
Till it wraps it's arms around you forever
Oh yeah yeah
Surrender, Surrender to love
It will only change your world for the better
Laura: Surrender to love

Ray:
I wanna feel like I got
Heaven all around me
Angels in the sky
I want to tell my heart
It finally want it's freedom
And what a sweet surprise
Laura:
I know there is a blessing
In each forget road
In every lesson learned
And in every, every, every love
Don't be afraid to fall
You never lose it all
Come and see
Everyone will win if we:

Surrender to love
Surrender to love
Till it wraps it's arms around you forever
Forever and ever
Come on darling
Surrender Surrender to love
I'm in love
It will only change your world for the better
Laura: Surrender to love

Ray: Trust in me to follow
Laura: just follow
Ray: trust in what you'll be tomorrow
Laura: Feel the change coming on like a sunrise.
And you'll be dreaming and you can be it
So just close your eyes
Surrender to love.
Surrender
Till it wraps it's arms around you forever.
Laura: forever
Surrender to love
Ray: I'll surrender baby
It will only change your world for the better
Laura: only change your world if you surrender
To love I love the love
Be around, around, surrender
