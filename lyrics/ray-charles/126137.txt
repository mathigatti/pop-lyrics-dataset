Ah, you can talk about the pit, barbecue
The band was jumpin', the people too
Ah, mess around
They doin' the mess around
They doin' the mess around,
everybody doin' the mess around


Ah, everybody was juiced, you can, bet your soul
They did the boogie-woogie, with a steady roll *
They mess around
They doin' the mess around
They doin' the mess around,
everybody doin' the mess around

Now, ah, when I say stop don't you move a peg
When I say go, just ah, shake your leg
And do the mess around
I declare, do the mess around
Yeah do the mess around,
everybody's doin' the mess around

Now let me have it there boy


Now you got it boy

(Yeah, ah, mess around, go on mess around)
(Mess around, boy)

Now this band's goin' to play from, 9 to 1
Everybody here's gonna have some fun
Doin' the mess around
Ah, doin' the mess around
They doin' the mess around,
everybody doin' the mess around

Now you see that girl, with that, diamond ring
She knows how to, shake that thing
Mess around
I declare, she can mess around
Ah, mess around,
everybody do the mess around
