Look at yourself, if you had a sense of humor, you would laugh to beat the band
Look at yourself, do you still believe the rumor that romance is simply grand?
Since you took it right on the chin, you have lost that bright toothpaste grin
My mental state is all a-jumble, I sit around and sadly mumble
Fools rush in, so here I am, very glad to be unhappy
I can't win, but here I am, more than glad to be unhappy
Unrequited love's a bore, and I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore, it's a pleasure to be sad
Like a straying baby lamb, with no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy, but oh, so glad!
