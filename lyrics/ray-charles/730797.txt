My mama done tol' me, when I was in knee-pants
My mama done tol' me, " Son a woman'll sweet talk"
And
Give ya the big eye, but when the sweet talkin's done
A woman's a two-face, A worrisome thing who'll
Leave ya to sing the blues in the night
Now the rain's a-fallin', hear the train's a-callin,
"Whooee!"


(My mama done tol' me) Hear dat lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle, "Whooee!"

(My mama done tol' me) A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin' back th' blues in the night
The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin' and the moon'll hide its light when you get the blues in
The night
Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song, he knows things are wrong,
And he's right
From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe, wherever the four winds blow
I been
In some big towns an' heard me some big talk, but there is one thing I know
A woman's a two-face, a
Worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night
My mama was right, there's blues in
