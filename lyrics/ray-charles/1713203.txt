Dark day people
I know things will come my way
Some day people
I know things will come my way


But as of now it seems
To live it just don't pay

My body is made of heartaches
Blues is my middle name
My heart is made of heartaches
Blues is my middle name

Makes no difference how hard I try
I'm mistreated just the same

Everyone's against me
I don't care where I go
Yes, everyone forgets poor me
I don't care where I go

But I feel that someday, somehow
Hard luck will leave me I know
