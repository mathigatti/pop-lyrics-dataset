I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor, no, no
'Cause I know what's ailing me


I've been too long away from my baby, ah!
I'm coming down with a misery
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

I don't need no doctor, I tell ya now
For my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
Only my baby's arms,
Could ever take away this chill
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

Now the doctor say I need rest
(Hey, hey)
Before I need her tenderness
(Hmm, hmm)
Put me on the critical list
(Hey hey)
When all I need is her sweet kiss
(Hmm, hmm)
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe
(It didn't soothe)
My emotion
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

I don't need no doctor
For my hope to live is gone
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor, no, no
Wah! My hope to live is gone
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

All I need is my baby
Baby, please!
Won't you please come on home
(I don't need no doctor)
You know what I'm talkin' about?
(I don't need no doctor)

I don't need no aspirins(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no lotion
(I don't need no doctor)
I say, I don't need, no vitamin pills
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no lotion
(I don't need no doctor)
I say, I don't need, no vitamin pills
(I don't need no doctor)
