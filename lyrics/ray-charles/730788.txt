The spirit's always willing when it's fed;
When it's not fed the spirit's dead.
And if the spirit really wants to dance
It needs a little more than bread
To cure the spirit's ache
Give it a little cake!


Come, you all kick up the cakewalk,
'Cause we got cake.
Lady Luck finally learn to bake.
Who said bread? Kick up the cakewalk
'Cause we got pie.

Here and now, not in the by and by.
Say good bye to trouble and famine
It's time to laugh
Laugh, boy, you can examine
The fatted calf.

Come, you all kick up the cakewalk,
'Cause we got cake.
Ev'ryone who is awake, walk
To cakewalk
'Cause we all got cake.
