1) you got me cryin again , you got me cryin again
What is this love all about , im in and then im out


2) your kisses right from the start ,
They came from your lips not your heart
You made me happy and then , somebody new looks good
To you you got me cryin again , just cryin for you

( solo piano )

2) repeat
