My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
And my arms long for you
Please come back to me


If you're in Arizona, I'll follow you
If you're in Minnesota, I'll be there too
You'll have a million chances to start anew
For my love is endless for you

My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
And my arms long for you
Please come back to me

An unimportant quarrel was what we had
We have to learn to live with the good and bad
Together we were happy, apart we're sad
This loneliness is driving me mad

My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
And my arms long for you
Please come back to me

Please come back to me
Please come back, come back, come back to me
