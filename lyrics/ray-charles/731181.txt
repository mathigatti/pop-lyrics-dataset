Time is a healer
But it cannot heal my heart,
My mind says I've forgotten you
And then I feel my heart.
Though the miles lie between us
But your fingers touch my own,
You're never far away from me
For you're too much my own.


You're nearer
Than my head is to my pillow,
Nearer than the wind is to the willow.
Dearer than the rain is
To the earth below,
Precious as the sun to
The things that grow.
You're nearer than the ivy to the wall is,
Nearer than the Winter to the Fall is,
Leave me
But when you're away
You'll know you're nearer
For I love you so.
