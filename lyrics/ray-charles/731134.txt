Single-O, all the way
Rain or shine
Gonna stay, Single-O
Till you're mine
Like the peach,
At the top, of the tree
Gonna stay, Single-O
Till it's me
And though I don't know what caresses
You expect to find
I know my address is
Lonesomeville till you make up your mind
When you do
And it's me
You adore
Then I'll be
Single-O no more
And though I don't know what caresses
You expect to find
I know my address is
Lonesomeville till you make up your mind
When you do
And it's me
You adore
Then I'll be
Single-O no more
