As I passed by
A real fine hotel
A chick walked out
She sure looked swell
I gave her the eye
And started to carry on
When a Cadillac cruised up
And 'swish' she was gone


It should've been me
   With that real fine chick
It should've been me
   With that real fine chick
Hey hey hey, hey, driving that, Cadillac

A little later on
A theater I passed
I spotted another chick
And did she have class
I was all set
To write her name in my book
When her husband came up and gave me a
Real dirty look

It should've been me
   With that real fine chick
It should've been me
   With that real fine chick
It should've been me
To have been her chaperone

When I got to the corner
I saw a sharp cat
With a 300 dollar suit on
And a 100 dollar hat
He was standing on the sidewalk
By a DynaFlow
When a voice within said,
"C'mon daddy, let's go."

It should've been me
   With that real fine chick
It should've been me
   With that real fine chick
It should've been me
Hey hey hey, hey, driving that, DynaFlow

I ate a bowl of chili
And I felt OK
At least until I passed
This fine Cafe
I saw a guy eatin'
A great big steak
While a waitress stood by feedin' him
Ice cream and cake

It should've been me
   With that real fine chick
It should've been me
   With that real fine chick
You know, it should've been me
Eatin' ice, cream and cake

It should've been me
   Gettin' my natural kicks
It should've been me
   Gettin' my natural kicks
Hey hey hey, hey, lovin' those, crazy chicks
