Old Peter Minuet had nothing to lose when he bought the isle of Manhatten
For twenty-six dollars and a bottle of booze and they threw in the Bronx and Staten
Pete thought that he had the best of the bargin but the poor red man just grinned,
And he grunted "ugh!" meaning okay in his jargon for he knew poor Pete was skinned.
We've tried to run the city....but the city ran away...
And now Peter Minuet
We can't continue it...
Broadway's turning into Coney,
Champagne Charlie's drinking gin,
Old New York is new and phony
Give it back to the Indians!
Two cents more to smoke a Lucky,
Dodging busses keep you thin,
Now New York is simply ducky,
Give it back to the Indians!
Take all the reds, on the boxes made for soap
Whites on Fifth Avenue
Blues down in Wall Street losing hope..
Big bargain today...Chief take it away!
Come you busted city slickers,
Better take it on the chin
Father Nick has lost his knickers
Give it back to the Indians!
