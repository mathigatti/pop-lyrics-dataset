Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now I'm found.
I was blind, but now I see!


Those grace that taught my heart to fear,
and grace my fears relieved!
well how precious did that grace appear
the hour I first believed.

When we've been there ten thousand years,
bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
than when we first begun!

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me!
Said I once was lost, but now I'm found.
I was blind, but now I see!
