Well, I say love, oh, love
Careless love
I said love, oh, love
Oh, careless love


Love, please tell me
What have I done
For you to hurt me all in fun

Well, you know
That I once was blind
But know I see
I say that I once was blind
But now I see

Whoa, you know I once was blind
But I'm so glad, so glad I see
That that old love has made
A fool of me

Well, you know what
A big fool I have been
Let me say what
A big fool I have been

Let me say what
What a big fool that I have been
But I'll be, I'll be one
All over again

Well, you know if I can mmm
Like a morning dove
Well, if I could mmm
Like a morning dove

Well, if I could moan
If I could moan
Like a morning dove
You know I'd moan
For everyone in love

That's why I said love
Whoa, whoa, whoa, love
Careless love
