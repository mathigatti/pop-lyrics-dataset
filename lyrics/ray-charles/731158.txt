When the church bells sound my plight
I'll look like a ghost in white,
But tonight I'm still a live one-
It's the kid's last fight.


There's a marital knot, and at noon I'll tie it-
All of my friends say I ought to try it.
If I must go, then I won't go quiet.
This is my night to howl!
I knew all of the boys who were well worth knowing,
Sowed all my oats and I'm good at sowing,
This is the time when the hen starts crowing.
This is my night to howl!
"The prisoner ate a hearty meal."
I know what that means all right.
I'm tramping along that last long mile
With a hell of an appetite.
While I still am alive I am going to mingle
Till I throw in the towel
I may be dead when the church bells jingle.
This is my night,
This is my night to howl!
