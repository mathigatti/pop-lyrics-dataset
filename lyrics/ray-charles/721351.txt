Dee Dee:
They can go away
Isn't it strange you always leaving things
Never mind I know this rule is not a whole
I hope I made you feel less alone
Think of me while you roam


Ray Charles:
It is no strange
But it's more, more than just a night of fame
There are things I believe should never be told, girl no
But you're the only one I want to hold
Cause it can get off the cold

Dee Dee:
Precious thing
You know I love you
You're such a wonderful thing
You make me dizzy whispering in my ear
Send my love to the next, somewhere

Ray Charles:
Ain't it funny, right
I'm always losing things
But you're like me you've known roaming
I hope I made you feel less alone
Think of me as you roam

Both:
Oh, precious thing
You know I love you
You're such a wonderful thing
Girl, you make me dizzy whispering in my ear
You my love, till the next, somewhere

Dee Dee:
Say no strength of freedom
Is still as much yours as my thing
I know promises can be hard to keep
The price I pay to let, oh baby
Was just to steal to steal my love from thee

Both:
Precious thing
You know I love you
You're such a wonderful thing
You make me dizzy whispering in my ear
Feel my love, till the next, somewhere
