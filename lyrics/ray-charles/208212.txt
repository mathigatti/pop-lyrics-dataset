Well, I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh, yeah
Said I got a woman, way over town
Good to me, oh, yeah


She gives me money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a kind of friend indeed
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh, yeah

She saves her loving, early in the morning
Just for me, oh, yeah
She saves her loving, early in the morning
Just for me, oh, yeah

She saves her loving, just for me
She loves me, so tenderly
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh, yeah

She's there to love me
Both day and night
Never grumbles or fusses
Always treats me right

Never running in the streets
Leaving me alone
She knows a woman's place
Is right there, now, in the home

I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh, yeah
Said I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh, yeah

Well, she's my baby, don't you understand
Yeah, I'm her loving man, now
I got a woman, way over town
She's good to me, oh, yeah

Well, don't you know she's all right
Well, don't you know she's all right
She's all right
She's all right
