Maggie dear, just won't go out alone,
Seems that she must have a chaperone,
When we go out no matter where we're bound
There's always somebody around.


She brings her father, her mother, her sister and her brother, 
Oh! I never see Maggie alone.
She brings her uncles and cousins, she's got â€˜em by the dozens, 
I never see Maggie alone.
And if I phone her, say to her "Sweet, 
Where shall we meet, supposin' that we eat,"
She brings her father, her mother, her sister and her brother, 
Oh! I never see Maggie alone.

She brings her father, her mother, her sister and her brother, 
Oh! I never see Maggie alone.
One night when we were out walking and she got tired of talking,
She invited me up to her home.
I turned the lights down, they were too bright,
Oh! What a sight when I turned on the light,
There was her father, her mother, her sister, and her brother
Oh! I never see Maggie alone.

I bought a roadster, two-seated, I even had it heated,
So that I could see Maggie alone,
While we were riding, and kissing, the engine started missing,
And we were a long way from home.
I got right out and then fast as I could, 
Found what was wrong, for when I raised the hood,
There was her father, her mother, her sister and her brother,
Oh! I never see Maggie alone.

One day she said she was wishing that I could take her fishing,
So I knew I'd see Maggie alone.
In the canoe there we two, there went gliding o'er the water,
Far from the noise of her home.
I threw the line in, thought I'd catch a trout.
I'd got a bite and pulled the line right out,
There was her father, her mother, her sister and her brother,
Oh! I never see Maggie alone.
