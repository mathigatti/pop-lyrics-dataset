Was it in Tahiti?
Were we on the Nile?
Long long ago, say an hour ago
I recall that I saw your smile
I remember you
You're the one who made my dreams come true
A few
Kisses ago
I remember you
You're the one who said "I love you, too"
I do, didn't you know?
I remember, too,
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain out of the blue
When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them
I remember you


When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them I remember, you
