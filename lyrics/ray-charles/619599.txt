In the heat of the night
Seems like a cold sweat
Creeping cross my brow, oh yes
In the heat of the night
I'm a feelin' motherless somehow
Stars with evil eyes stare from the sky
(In the heat of the night)
Ain't a woman here before
Knows how to make the morning come
So hard to keep control
Well I could sell my soul for just a little light
In the heat of the night
I've got trouble wall to wall
Oh yes I have
I repeat in the night
Must be an ending to us all
Oh Lord, it won't be long
Yes, just you be strong
And it'll be all right
