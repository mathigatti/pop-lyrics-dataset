It's happening so suddenly
it's hurtin'
Runnin' through our fingers now desertin'
Built it all on solid ground
but now it's no so certain
don't wanna look into your eyes
and see this good love dyin'.


And all the pain and bitterness today
in every single promise we betrayed
the hurt we never noticed, till it wouldn't go away
and if you look into my eyes
you're gonna end up cryin'

Good love gone bad
now all our dreams are broken,
closing doors that once were open
knowing into our hearts that it's all over
Still deep inside you know you wanna stay
but it's so hard to go our separate ways
when all the good we had is hurtin' so bad.

Good love gone bad
we stopped believin'
stopped the wanting and stop the needin'
saying to ourselves that it's all over
Still deep inside I know I wanna stay
but it's so hard to go our separate ways
when all the good we had is gone.

No good guys or bad guys,
wrong or right
Sometimes things are not so black and white
You hold on till it kills you
or you finally see the light
and when you look into her eyes
someone is tryin'.

Good love gone bad
now all our dreams are broken
closing doors that once were open
knowing in our hearts that it's all over
Still deep inside you know you wanna stay
but you can't bring back yesterday
when all the good we had is goin' so bad.

Good love gone bad
we stopped believin'
stopped the wanting and stop the needin'
saying to ourselves that it's all over
Still deep inside I know I wanna stay
but it's so hard to go our separate ways
when all the good we had is hurtin' so bad.

No good guys and bad guys after all
all I really know is...
I still love you.
