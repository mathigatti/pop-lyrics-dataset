Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby and she lives next door
Every mornin' 'fore the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah I just love her so


When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say, "She told me so"
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her (knock-knock-knock-knock) on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her (knock-knock-knock-knock) on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
