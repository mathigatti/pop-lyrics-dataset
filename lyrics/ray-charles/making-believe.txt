Making believe
Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me a-long and so blue
But I'll always dream still, I'll never own you
Making believe, it's all I can do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe, I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you, making believe


Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours, I find, are so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe, what else can I do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe, I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you, making believe
