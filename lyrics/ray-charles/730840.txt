I don't want you to say pretty words
Makin' music like the sweet singing birds
I don't want you to be no fool
And don't treat me no special way - Just say
"I love you so" - now and then ....
'Cause if you really, really love me, yeah,
I like to hear it some time
Sometimes you ought to take me in your arms
And say the words that I want to hear
You ought to sooth me with your magic charms
Call me "sweetheart", "darling" or "dear"!
I don't want you to beg or cry
A little affection would satisfy
I don't want you to be upset
I just want to hear you say
"I love you so" - now and then ....
'Cause if you really, really love me, yeah,
I like to hear it some time
