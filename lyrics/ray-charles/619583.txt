If your sweetheart, sends a letter, of goodbye
It's no secret, you'll feel better, if you cry
When wakened, from a bad dream, don't you sometimes think it's
real
Well it's only, false emotion, that you feel


If your heartaches, seems to hang around, too long
And your blues, keep getting blue-er, with each song
Remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down now, and baby go on and cry

(If your heartaches seem to hang around too long)
(And your blues keep getting blue-er with each song)
Well remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
Why don't you let your hair down now, baby go on and cry

I said let your hair down, baby go on and cry.
