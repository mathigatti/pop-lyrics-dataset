Down through the ages
Round this time of year
People's hearts all a-glow
Yuletide carols fill the air with cheer
While children laugh and play out in the snow
Lights on christmas trees
And snowflakes fallin' down
What a lovely site to see
You will always know when christmas time is near
You feel the need to be in harmony
'Cause christmas time
Is really more than givin'
It's spreading all the news of peace and love
Christmas time
Is all about receiving
The gift that god has sent from up above


[instrumental interlude]

People goin' here
And people goin' there
Buying gifts for those they
Know and love
Never stop to think
That the greatest gift of all
Is he who sends his love from up above
Waitin' in suspense
To open all my gifts
It seems like the time just creeps along
When we finally see the presents that we have
We open up our hearts and sing this song
That christmas time
Is really more than givin'
It's spreading all the news of peace and love
Christmas time
Is all about receiving
The gift that god has sent from up above
Christmas time
Is really more than givin'
Christmas time
Is all about receiving
Christmas time
Spreading news of peace and love
Christmas time
The gift that god has sent from up above
Christmas time
Is really more than givin'
