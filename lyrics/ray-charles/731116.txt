The time has come to air my feelings
There's just so much confusion going down
I'm not the kind to be complaining
But sometimes you got to stand out from the crowd
Everyone's got their own opinion
And you know I sure got mine
It's my world


Don't you come a messin' with my world
I don't appreciate the fact some people just can't see
It's hurting you and me
It's my world

My world, your world, our world, one world
We all got to get it together
There's just no other place to go
If we can't find some peace with each other
Then we'll be dead before you know
I don't have all the answers
I'm just one man who's searching for a change
It's my world

Don't you come a messin' with my world
I don't appreciate the fact some people just can't see
It's hurting you and me
It's my world

My world, your world, our world, one world
I hear the cries of the people
From every single corner of this earth
Where's the love, the compassion
Where's the hope what's the future worth
