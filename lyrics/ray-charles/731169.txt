Wait till you see him
See how he looks
Wait till you hear him laugh.
Painters of paintings
Writers of books
Never could tell the half.
Wait till you feel
The warmth of his glance,
Pensive and sweet and wise.
All of it lovely
All of it thrilling
I'll never be willing to free him.
When you see him
You won't believe your eyes
You won't believe your eyes.
