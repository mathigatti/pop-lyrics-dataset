No one, ever kiss me
The way you do!
Oh, and no one,
Ever told me, i love you,


No one, ever care!
No one, ever sad!
All those dreams,
That i dreamed will come true!

I sad no one, ever hurt me
The way you do!
Oh, baby, no one, ever broke my
Heart in two!

So i keep on care,
My hope, my through!
Oh, no one, no one, but you!
(no body, but you!)

I sad no one, ever hurt me
The way you do
Oh and no one ever broke my
Heart in two!

So i keep on care
My hope, my through!
Cause no one, but no one, but you!
Ah, no one, no! nobody but you!
(no body, but you!)
Yeah!
