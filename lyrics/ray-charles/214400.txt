Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' at my front door
You done daddy dirty
He sure don't want you no more


Don't let the sun catch you lyin'
Lyin' at my front door
Daddy's done turned salty
And baby, you made him so sore

You can cry, cry, cry
Yes baby, you can wail
Beat your head on the pavement
Till the man comes and throws you in jail

Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' at my front door
You done your daddy dirty
I tell you, he just don't want you no more

Don't let the sun catch you lyin'
Lyin' at my front door
Daddy's done turned salty
Baby, you made him so sore

Whoa, you know you done me dirty now
And I just don't want you no more
