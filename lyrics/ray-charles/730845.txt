The sleepless nights - the daily fights
The quick toboggan - when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses - and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again
The broken dates - the endless waits
The lovely loving - and the hateful hates
The conversation - with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again
No more pain - no more strain
Now I'm sane - but I would rather be punched - drunk
The pulled out fur - of cat and cur
The fine mismating - of a him and her
I've learned my lesson - but I wish I were
In love again
The furtive sigh - the blackened eye
The words: "I love you - 'til the day I day"
The self deception - that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again
When love congeals - it soon reveals
The faint aroma - of performing seals
The double-crossing - of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again
No, no more care - no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now) - but I'd rather be puncdrunk
Believe me sir - I much prefer
The classic battle - of a him and her
I don't like quiet - and I wish I were
In love again - in love again - in love again
