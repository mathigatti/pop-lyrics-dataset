*  Understanding is the best thing in the world ,
between a boy and a girl


boy and girl and even a woman or a man , its always
better when you realy understand

1) You know understanding is a mighty powerful thing ,
thats why it makes me so sad
when I see my friends wandering aroung thru the world
, never knowing the meaning of the word
understanding , so in the next few minutes, Im gonna
try to explain just exactly what it means
now wait a minute, listen , for instance , you take me
and my old lady , we gotta good thing goin
because I know If I dont work and pay the rent and the
bills and buy her fine pretty clothes to wear well ,
there are fifteen other guys  just waitin round the
corner , and I dont care how much that woman loves me
, sheç£- gonna go out and find herself one of them who
will and thats why I believe that

*  repeat

2) Now listen I dont want you to think that this is a
one sided affair , no no 
because my old lady also understands that a man must
have respect
what I mean is , if she must play around dont let me
catch her , because what I dont see cant hurt me , you
understand? but on the other hand , If I should ever
catch her Im not gonna talk about-a
and call her a bunch of bad names like you all might
no no mh
what Im gonna do , Im gonna go down-town  to the
hardware store and buy myself a double blade axe ,
come back , square off, and believe her soulç£- gonna
belong to the good lord
because her headç£- gonna belong to me , and I
guarantie sheç£l know what I mean when Ill say
