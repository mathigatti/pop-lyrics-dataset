It seems we stood and talked like this, before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when
The clothes you're wearing are the clothes, you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when
Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happenin' again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when
Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happenin' again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when


When you're awake, the things you think
Come from the dream you dream
Thought has wings, and lots of things
Are seldom what they seem
Sometimes you think you've lived before
All that you live to day
Things you do come back to you
As though they knew the way
Oh the tricks your mind can play
