Hear to this
All the girl could want a little attention
From a man who's strong and not to mention
Kiss and caressing har all night long
But all that boy wants is to hit and run off
He and his friends, they sit and they laugh
Going around talking 'bout the girls they used in the past


You're gonna get what's comingo to you
For all the bad, bad things you do to your

Lady, treat her like a lady
U'll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat like a lady
Lady, treat her like a lady
U'll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat like a lady

(Go, what's goes around comes around, go, go)

Hear it
She stopped going to church, she don't wanna go to school
She left with anger when he took her for a fool
Even though her friend tell her to just keep cool
Didn't tell her from the start to what's he had planned
Right in her face with another woman
Now she's in jall for attacking her, man

You're gonna get what's comingo to you
For all the bad, bad things you do to your

Lady, treat her like a lady
U'll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat like a lady

Lady, treat her like a lady
U'll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat like a lady

(Go, what's goes around comes around, go, go)
(Treat her like a lady) oh, baby, yeah
(Treat her like a lady) baby
(Treat her like a lady) baby
(Treat her like a lady) ooooh

(Some anybody, some anybody, block her, hit her and run, yes)
(Some anybody, block her, hit her and run)
(Some anybody, some anybody, block her, hit her and run, yes)
(Some anybody, block her, hit her and run)

(Go, what's goes around comes around, go, go)

Tell it to her straight, she can take the truth
Don't lead her on and leave her confused
Anyone would rather be alone than be used
Don't sit and think you'll hurt her feelings
She only wants to know just what the dead is
Next time beware of whose heart you're breaking

You're gonna get what's comingo to you
For all the bad, bad things you do to your

Lady, treat her like a lady
U'll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat like a lady

Lady, treat her like a lady
U'll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat like a lady
Crazy, crazy, ooh

(Lady, treat her like a lady) I'm in love
(U'll make a good girl crazy) go, whats goes around comes around
(If you don't treat like a lady) treat her like a lady
(Lady, treat her like a lady)
(U'll make a good girl crazy)
(If you don't treat like a lady)

(Some anybody, some anybody, block her, hit her and run, yes)
(Some anybody, some anybody, block her, hit her and run, yes)
