My precious one, my tiny one
Lay down your pretty head
My dearest one, my sleepy one
It's time to go to bed
My precious one, my darling one
Don't let your lashes weep
My cherished one, my weary one
It's time to go to sleep
Just bow your head
And give your cares to me
Just close your eyes
And fall into the sweetest dream
Cuz in my loving arms
You're safe as you will ever be
So hush my dear and sleep
And in your dreams
You'll ride on angels' wings
Dance with the stars
And touch the face of God
And if you should awake
My precious one, my tiny one
I'll kiss your little cheek
And underneath the smiling Moon
I'll sing you back to sleep
