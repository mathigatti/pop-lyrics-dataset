This is from the heart
Ready to let my guard down whatever the cost
Keeping it safe you just can't love outside the box
So I'm gonna try my luck on you


This is from a girl
Who still believed there was someone in the world
To take her at her best and her worst
Won't give up when it hurts
So I'm gonna try my luck
I'm gonna try my luck, baby
I'm gonna try my luck on you
Cause I wish you'd, I wish you'd stay

Cause there's something about the chase
That's got you running through my mind all day
And I can't keep up
Cause I'm still reveling in the rush of the chase

This is for the one
Always walking to the beat of their own drum
Ain't afraid to take it as it comes
Yeah you wanna try your luck
You wanna try your luck on me
Cause I wish you'd, I wish you'd stay

Cause there's something about the chase
That's got you running through my mind all day
And I can't keep up
Cause I'm still reveling in the rush of the chase

I wish you'd, I wish you'd stay
I might run but won't walk away
If you keep making my heart race
Til I can't keep up, I'll be reveling in the rush of the chase
I wish you would

Keep me running, running, running
Searching for that something something
And I think it could be
You and me

So stay
Cause there's something about the chase
That's got you running through my mind all day
And I can't keep up
Cause I'm still reveling in the rush

I wish you'd, I wish you'd stay
I might run but won't walk away
If you keep making my heart race
Til I can't keep up, I'll be reveling in the rush of the chase

Oh I wish you'd, I wish you'd stay (I wish you would, I wish you would)
Oh stay (I wish you would, I wish you would)
Oh stay (I wish you would, I wish you would)
Stay

I wish you would
I wish you would
