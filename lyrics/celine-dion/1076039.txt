I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone


Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone...

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was going tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone...
How do I get you alone...

How do I get you alone...
How do I get you alone...
Alone, alone...
