I live my life like a runaway
I had my dreams in a special place
I'm waiting here for my prince to come
To save me from the darkness
I count the nights I count the days, the ways, yeah
Don't wanna fight, would be in vain
So in vain, so in vain


I can run, but I can't hide
It's because, I'm living in the shadow of love, yeah
To me you are the only one I dream of
So I'm living in the shadow of love

Your love surrounds me it's everywhere
It is my shelter it is my air
A moon eclipse in the burning sun
Make a shade just for me
For you I'd wait forever baby and a day yes I would
To be there if your love should come my way, my way

I can run but, I can't hide
It's because, I'm living in the shadow of love yeah
To me you are the only one I dream of
Cuz I'm living in the shadow of love

Too many nights too many days
I've hidden for the sun
And though I've tried to breakaway
You hold on me is just too strong
I'm living in the shadow of love

I can run but, I can't hide
It's because, I'm living in the shadow of love yeah
To me you are the only one I dream of
Cuz I'm living in the shadow of love
