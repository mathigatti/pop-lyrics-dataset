If I could
I'd protect you from the sadness in your eyes
Give you courage in a world of compromise
Yes, I would


If I could
I would teach you all the things I've never learned
And I'd help you cross the bridges that I've burned
Yes, I would

If I could
I would try to shield your innocence from time
But the part of life I gave you isn't mine
I've watched you grow, so I could let you go

If I could
I would help you make it through the hungry years
But I know that I could never cry your tears
But I would
If I could

Yes, if I live
In a time and place where you don't want to be
You don't have to walk along this road with me
My yesterday won't have to be your way

If I knew
I would try to change the world I brought you to
And there isn't very much that I could do
But I would
If I could

Oh baby
I just want to protect you
And help my baby through the hungry years
'Cause you're part of me
And if you ever ever ever need
I said a shoulder to cry on
Or just someone to talk to
I'll be there, I'll be there

I didn't change your world
But I would
If I could
