I used to fall
In love with all
Those boys who call
On young cuties
But now I find
I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to Daddy


If I invite a boy some night
To dine on some fine fin and haddie
I just adore his asking for more
But my heart belongs to Daddy

Yes my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes my heart belongs to Daddy
Dadada dadada dadada

So I want to warn you laddie
Though I know you perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to Daddy
'Cause my Daddy he treats me so well

Yes my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes my heart belongs to Daddy
Dadada dadada dadada

So I want to warn you laddie
Though I know you perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to Daddy
'Cause my Daddy
