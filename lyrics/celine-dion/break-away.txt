From the fire in your words
To the dagger in your eye
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
I pretend to be asleep
But I know you hear my cry
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
But if I
Really want a change
Then I must admit
That I'm the one to blame


If I could break away
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted
I could break away

Is it true what people say
That it's darkest before dawn
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
Any hope we might have saved
Is too weak to let live on
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
And if I
Really want a change
Then tonight I'm gonna need
All of my strength

If I could break away
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted
I could break away

Oh, anything is better than this
I know
Anything is better

If I could break away
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted
I could break away

If I could break away
If I could turn the page
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted
I could break away
