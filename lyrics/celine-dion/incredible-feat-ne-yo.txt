It's a little intimidating
But since there's no way to come down
Lets give them something amazing


Lets make them remember
Using one word

Incredible
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lets make them remember
We were incredible
Simply incredible
Oh, oh, oh, oh

We even counted us out (oh, oh, oh, oh)
We weren't sure we'd make it (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Be we've learned (oh, oh, oh, oh)
No matter what they dish out (oh, oh, oh, oh)
