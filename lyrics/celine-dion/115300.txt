Don't care, what they think
How they feel, or what they say
You're everything, I never knew
I always wanted, baby
I've been warned, so many times
They tell me I've ignored the signs


But nobody knows you like I do
The only one for me is you

I can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it
When the wrong one loves you right
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah)
Can't run, can't hide, can't say no
When the wrong ones loves you right
(Oh-oh-oh oh)
When the wrong ones loves you right

Getting tired, of hearing that
You're dangerous, but they won't stop
Until I leave, they won't believe
That being with you won't break my heart
So worried 'bout, the road ahead
They can't see that, you're my best friend

They're never gonna take me away from you
There's nothing they can do

I can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it
When the wrong one loves you right
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah)
Can't run, can't hide, can't say no
When the wrong ones loves you right
(Oh-oh-oh oh)
When the wrong ones loves you right

How can I walk away
When the feeling's so strong
I know you're where I belong
They say I let my heart
Make up my mind
That's why I'll never say goodbye

I can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it
When the wrong one loves you right
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah)
Can't run, can't hide, can't say no
When the wrong ones loves you right
(Oh-oh-oh oh)
When the wrong ones loves you right

I can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it
When the wrong one loves you right
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah)
Can't run, can't hide, can't say no
When the wrong ones loves you right
(Oh-oh-oh oh)
When the wrong ones loves you right
