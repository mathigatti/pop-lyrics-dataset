You and me
Two hearts that melt and flow into infinity
We leave the world we know to voyage breathlessly
Our bed, the sea
And in its waves, just you and me


You and me
Free of wrong and right of old taboos and lies
And in our endless night
Come dreams and whispered sighs
Caressingly, to you and me

Through deserted hopes that we must hold anew
Love has filled our emptiness and waiting
The unprotected children that we were before
Turned into you and me
Reborn in love once more

Carry me beyond all doubt and fears
Of passion's fantasy
To God created spirits, desire's destiny
Made heavenly for you and me
Aahhh-aahh-aahh

When I had no faith, you taught me how to care
Giving me a second chance of living
Most words are only words
But your's become my prayer
My body and my soul, you echo everywhere

Pleasure me, until the early morning light
Make love to me
I hear your every turn
So all my days can be
Drowned in the sea, aahhhh, you and me
