Ooh, baby, hmmm

Listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me
I met an angel on Christmas day


Twentyfourth of December
It was a cold and snowing night
I still can remember Gazing at the stars and the moonlight
Fell asleep on a sofabed
Dreams of Christmas in my head
But I woke up to my surprise
There he was right in front of my eyes

Listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me
I met an angel on Christmas day

I was stuffing the stockings
And hanging tincel on the tree
When I heard him knocking
I opened the door in time to see
Carollers sing "Silver Bells"
I saw his face, that's when I fell
He was there bent on one knee
Santa sent him just for me

Listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me
I met an angel on a Christmas day

Yeah, yeah

And I know this love will grow
When flowers bloom in early spring
I'll be his bride
I'll wear his ring

So if your looking for an angel who
Is gonna make your every dream come true
Just write a letter saying "Santa hey
I'll need an angel next Christmas day"

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby
Ooh

Ding, ding, dong, ding

Listen up what I got to say, hey
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring and ring in me
I met an angel on a Christmas day

Ooh, listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay

Chapel bells are gonna ring
Chapel bells are gonna ring

I met an angel on a Christmas day

Listen up to what I got to say
True love and it's on its way
I met an angel on a Christmas day

Yeah

On a Christmas day

Ooh
Ooh, baby
