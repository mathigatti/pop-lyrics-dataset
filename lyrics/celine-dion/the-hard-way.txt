I’ve been, I’ve been, I’ve been
I’ve been touching fires for the sake of feeling
I’ve been chasing, chasing
Chasing all these highs so I could crash the ceiling
I’ve been restless tempted to follow every devil way down
I took it so low and at the time it looked like no way out


I had to see
Try to believe
I write my story and this ain’t how its ending
Said to myself
Said to myself
This ain’t how I’m gonna go down

When the bottom hit my soul
I had to climb up all alone
When the nights shut down my hope
I had to find a light to hold
You gotta break just a little
Die just a little
To come alive in the right way
And sometimes to get home
You gotta go
The hard way, hard way

Turning, turning, turning
Turning every corner cuz my heart was yearning
For something more than 4 am messed up in bed
Oh I don’t miss that feeling
I don’t see a reason chasing love down a dead end oh
But see the truth is, I wouldn’t know that unless I did

I had to see
Try to believe
I write my story and this ain’t how its ending
Said to myself
Said to myself
This ain’t how I’m gonna go down

When the bottom hit my soul
I had to climb up all alone
When the nights shut down my hope
I had to find a light to hold
You gotta break just a little
Die just a little
To come alive in the right way
And sometimes to get home
You gotta go
The hard way

I wouldn't know what I'm made of
If I took the easy way out (I took the easy way out)
As long as it took me to get here
The hard times were worth what I found (I found)
I wouldn't know what I'm made of (I wouldn't know)
If I took the easy way out (Took the easy way out)
As long as it took me to get here (To get here)
The hard times were worth what I found

When the bottom hit my soul
I had to climb up all alone
When the nights shut down my hope
I had to find a light to hold
You gotta break just a little
Die just a little
To come alive in the right way
And sometimes to get home
You gotta go
The hard way
