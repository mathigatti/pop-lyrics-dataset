I've had it up to here up, to my neck
With everything politically correct 
Just wanna lock myself away, leave me alone 
Gonna lay it all out on my hair brush microphone 


I wanna sing like nobody’s listening 
I wanna talk like nobody cares
I wanna party like a belieber 
I wanna wear whatever I wear 

I wanna dance dance dance dance dance like nobody’s watching
I wanna dance dance dance dance dance like nobody’s watching
I wanna dance dance dance dance dance like nobody’s watching
I wanna dance dance dance dance dance like nobody’s watching
Nobody
Nobody

Too much information in my head
I need to disconnect, I'm in the red 
Just wanna get my body right back in the zone 
Gonna lay it all out on my hairbrush microphone 

I wanna sing like nobody’s listening 
I wanna talk like nobody cares
I wanna party like a belieber 
I wanna wear whatever I wear 

I wanna dance dance dance dance dance like nobody’s watching
I wanna dance dance dance dance dance like nobody’s watching
I wanna dance dance dance dance dance like nobody’s watching
I wanna dance dance dance dance dance like nobody’s watching

I wanna dance
Like nobody’s watching
I wanna dance like nobody’s watching, nobody’s watching
I wanna dance like nobody’s watching, nobody’s watching
I wanna dance dance dance dance dance like nobody’s watching
Nobody
Nobody 
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody
