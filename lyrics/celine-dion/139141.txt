O, come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O, come ye, o, come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels! O, come, let us adore him
O, come, let us adore him
O, come, let us adore him
Christ, the Lord. Sing choirs of angels
Sing, in exhaltation
O, sing, all ye citizens of heav'n above. Glory to God
Glory in the highest o come, let us adore him
O, come, let us adore him
O, come, let us adore him
Christ, the Lord. Yea, Lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Oh, Jesus, to thee be the glory giv'n
Word of the father
Now in flesh appearing o come, let us adore him
O, come, let us adore him
O, come, let us adore him
Christ, the Lord
