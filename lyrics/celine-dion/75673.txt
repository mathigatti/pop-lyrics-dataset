Everything you are 
Everything you'll be 
Touches the current of love 
So deep in me 
Every sigh in the night 
Every tear that you cry 
Seduces me 


All that I am 
All that I'll be 
Means nothing at all 
If you can't be with me 
Your most innocent kiss 
Or your sweetest caress 
Seduces me 

I don't care about tomorrow 
I've given up on yesterday 
Here and now is all that matters 
Right here with you is where I'll stay 

Everything in this world 
Every voice in the night 
Every little thing of beauty 
Comes shining thru in your eyes 
And all that is you becomes part of me too 
'Cause all you do seduces me 

And if I should die tomorrow 
I'd go down with a smile on my face 
I thank God I've ever known you 
I fall down on my knees 
For all the love we've made 

Every sigh in the night 
Every tear that you cry 
Seduces me Seduces me 
All that you do ..... Seduces me
