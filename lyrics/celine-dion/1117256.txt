One more hours burns so scared of his return
That I can't sleep tonight in this hospital light
You call it tragedy, it's just another day to me
For my heart beats with fear
As his footsteps draw near


The life I meant to lead
Won't slip away from me

(CHORUS)
'Cause this time is the last time
I know that my eyes have seen too much
This nightmare it's not fair
And I've had enough
You break me
You just say you're sorry
You call this love?
Cause this time your lies are not enough
This time

There's nothing left of this
Your whispered words and empty treats
Of what I thought this would be
The last treat has come undone
To reveal what I've become
Another victim of a poisoned love

I've been afraid for years
But that won√Ç't keep me here

(CHORUS)
'Cause this time is the last time
I know that my eyes have seen too much
This nightmare it's not fair
And I've had enough
You break me
Did you say you're sorry
You call this love?
But this time your lies are not enough
This Time

And what remains a mystery
You can not have the best of me
So I am taking back all you took from me

(CHORUS)
'Cause this time is the last time
I know that my eyes have seen too much
This nightmare it's not fair
And I've had enough
You break me
Did you say you're sorry
You call this love?
But this time your lies are not enough
This Time
