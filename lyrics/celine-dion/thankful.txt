Circle around like butterflies
Escape from pouring rain
Running to the alleyways
Steel their little kiss again


You''re my only weakness
But somehow you made me strong
After chasing ghost and fairytales
I''m right where I belong

And I don''t know where I''ve been looking
And I don''t care where you have been before

But I''m thankful to be here
Thankful to feel free
Thankful my prayers have been answered
I''m thankful you listened
Thankful to heaven
Thankful for feeling alive again
Thankful that heart's always meant

Right it all, on paper dolls
Let them play their little games
Of who loves who and what is true
No one ever takes the blame

I see you through the window
And it takes my breath away
But I' lose the floor beneath me
And all that''s left to say

As I don''t know where I was going
And I don''t care where we have been before

But I''m thankful to be here
Thankful to feel free
Thankful my prayers have been answered
I''m thankful you listened
Thankful to heaven
Thankful for feeling alive again
Thankful that heart's always meant

And I caught rainbows
Falling down
When I start spinning
Round and around and around

But I''m thankful to be here
Thankful to feel free
Thankful my prayers have been answered
I''m thankful you listened
Thankful to heaven
Thankful for feeling alive again
Thankful my heart's always meant

Thankful my heart's always meant
