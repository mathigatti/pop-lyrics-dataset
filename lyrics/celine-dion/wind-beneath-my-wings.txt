Oh oh oh oh oh
It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine
That's your way
You always walked a step behind


So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
I want you to know I know the truth
Of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero
You're everything I would like to be
I can fly higher than an eagle
You are the wind beneath my wings

Did I ever tell you you're my hero
You're everything everything I wish I could be
Oh and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
You are the wind beneath my wings
You are the wind beneath my wings

Oh the wind beneath my wings
You you you you are the wind beneath my wings

Fly fly fly high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you thank you
Thank God for you
The wind beneath my wings
