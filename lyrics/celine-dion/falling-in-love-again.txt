When the Sun went down on that day
I never thought that love would come back to me
When I closed my eyes and tried to dream
Darkness was the only thing I could see


I had run out of hope
Reached the end of the road
Hit the rocks at the bottom with no farther to go
But just when I thought I was destined to end up all alone
You showed me there's more to this life

I can’t believe I'm falling in love once again
I can't believe I’m falling in love, but I am
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can't believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love once again

When you take my hand you hold my heart
And I know everything will be alright
When you touch me there I feel it everywhere
I'm loving things I never thought I would like

I can't believe I'm falling in love once again
I can’t believe I’m falling in love, but I am
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can’t believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love
Once again 

Just when I thought I was destined to end up all alone
Showed me there's more to this life

I can't believe I'm falling in love
Oh I'm falling in love once again
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can’t believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love
Once again
