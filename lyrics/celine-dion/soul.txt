No blade, grenade, no bullet
Won't let it get under my skin
Under my skin yeah
No storm on Earth, no negative words
No way, I won't let them in
Won't let them in


I'm not made of steel, I'm not made of stone
And I'm not made of glass that breaks in pieces on the floor
I'm not made of armor, I'm made of something stronger
I'm made of heart, and blood, and sweat, and flesh, and bone
I'm not made of steel, I'm not made of stone
I'm made of soul

I don't look back, the past has passed
I'm only living in this moment
In this moment yeah
And if I ever fall
I'll rise just like the sun
Into tomorrow, into tomorrow

I'm not made of steel, I'm not made of stone
And I'm not made of glass that breaks in pieces on the floor
I'm not made of armor, I'm made of something stronger
I'm made of heart, and blood, and sweat, and flesh, and bone
I'm not made of steel, I'm not made of stone
I'm not made of steel, I'm made of soul

I'm made of, I'm made of, I'm made of soul
I'm made of, I'm made of, I'm made of soul

I'm not made of steel, I'm not made of stone
And I'm not made of glass that breaks in pieces on the floor
I'm not made of armor, I'm made of something stronger
I'm made of heart, and blood, and sweat, and flesh, and bone

I'm not made of steel, I'm not made of stone
And I'm not made of glass that breaks in pieces on the floor
I'm not made of armor, I'm made of something stronger
I'm made of heart, and blood, and sweat, and flesh, and bone

I'm not made of steel, I'm not made of stone
I'm not made of steel, I'm made of soul
I'm not made of steel
I'm not made of stone
I'm made of soul
