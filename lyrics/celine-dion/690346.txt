Never know how much I love you, 
Never know how much I care. 
When you put your arms around me 
I get a Fever that's so hard to bear. 


You give me Fever, 
When you kiss me 
Fever when you hold me tight 
Fever, in the morning 
Fever all through the night 
 
Ev'rybody's got the Fever 
That is something you all know 
Fever isn't such a new thing 
Fever started long ago 

Romeo loved Juliet, 
Juliet she felt the same. 
When he pout his arms around her, 
He said, "Julie, baby, you're my flame." 

You give me Fever, 
When you kiss me 
Fever when you hold me tight 
Fever, in the morning 
Fever all through the night 
 
Captain Smith and Pocahantas 
Had a very mad affair 
When her daddy tried to kill him, she said, 
" Oh daddy, don't you dare." 

He gives me Fever, 
When you kiss me 
Fever when he holds me tight 
Fever, I'm his Missus 
Daddy won't you treat him right 

Now you've listened to my story 
Here's a point that I have made. 
Chicks were born to give you Fever 
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade 
They give you fever, 
When you kiss them 
Fever if you live and learn. 
Fever , 'til you sizzle 
What a lovely way to burn 
What a lovely way to burn 
What a lovely way to burn
