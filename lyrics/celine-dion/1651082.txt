What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come, hear the music play.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret.
Put down the knitting, the book and the broom,
Time for a holiday.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret.
Come taste the wine, come hear the band,
Come blow your horn, start celebrating
Right this way, your table's waiting.
No use permitting some prophet of doom
To wipe every smile away.
Life is a Cabaret old chum,
Only a Cabaret old chum,
And I love a Cabaret!
