Did you ever fall in love at the right time or place
Does it always have to move
At its own kind a pace
When you're driving on cruise control
Coming off a bumpy ride
And your heart is back in shape
Then it hits you with no chance to hide


But don't you miss out on the way
Don't find a reason to say

Coulda woulda shoulda
But I didn't do that
You gotta give it a shot
Dare to believe
And don't say you
Coulda woulda shoulda
But I didn't do that
Just throw in everything you've got
'Cause in love there's no holding back

You tell me that you play it safe cause you're afraid
To hurt your neck
On that rollercoaster trip
Never knowing what you'd get
But do you  wanna be cynical
On a date with destiny
Giving up the greatest rush
Who knows what it turns out to be
No don't you miss out the way
Don't find a reason to say

Chorus

It's meant to be
Don't think about it
Let love run free
'Cause you're on your way
Follow your heart when it's calling on you
Don't you say
