To a child the world is so wide
To a child storms are outside
Calm your fear the rainbow's clear
Ending where you start
Calling to your heart


Everything you see
Everything you find
The darkest memories
All come clearer
When you open your eyes

Children are like boats in the sea
Tossed and torn
They travel on
Ride the waves
Be strong and brave
Every stroke you row
Teaches you to grow

Everything you feel
Everything you find
The darkest memories
All come clearer
Like the star in the sky

Everything you see
Everything you find
The deepest mysteries
All come clearer
When you open your eyes

Run and catch the wind
Beyond it you will find
The world is cold
The world is cold
Oh

Everything you see
Everything you find
The darkest memories
All come clearer
When you open your eyes

Everything you see
Everything you find
The sweetest mysteries
All come clearer
Everyday of your life

To a child
The world is wide
To a child
Storms are outside
