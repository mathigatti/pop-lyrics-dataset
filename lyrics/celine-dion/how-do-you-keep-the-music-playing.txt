How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?


How do you not run out of new things to say?
And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same?
And tell me, how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear his name?

I know the way I feel for you it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends

If we can try, with every day, to make it better as it grows
With any luck, then I suppose
The music never ends
I know, the way I feel for you
It's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid

That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck, then I suppose
The music never ends
