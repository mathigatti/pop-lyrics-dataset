Celine: 
The time is right for me to play
And find a hot band right away
I wanted the best to go on the road
So I called the best and he's Mego and I said:
Hello, hello, am I talking to you?
Hello Mego?


Mego:
Oh What a surprise it's you Celine

Celine:
Do you know a drummer who can make a scene?

Mego:
I happen to know a drummer for your show
He rocks so steady, should I get him ready?
Celine:
Peter Babeau, here he comes

To feel the body man
I need a bass that never ends
So I rang and I rang and I rang, rang, rang
And I rang Mego and I said:
Hello, hello, I'm calling you again
Hello Mego?

Mego:
Can it be a dream, or is this Celine?

Celine:
Do you know a bass that jams like a cat?

Mego:
I happen to know an amazing guy
When he plays his fingers fly

Celine:
Stephane Baultier, here he comes

The next thing I need
Is a guitar that can scream
So I rang and I rang and I rang, rang, rang
And I rang Mego and I said:
Hello, hello, am I getting to you Mego?
It's me again

Mego:
Oh how long has it been?, oh it's you Celine

Celine:
I hate to insist, but I need a guitarist

Mego:
To play second bar you'll need a star
With sounds so bizarre and he owns his own car

Celine:
Pierre Gautier, here he comes

The next thing that I need
Is a keyboard player with speed
So I rang and I rang and I rang and I rang and I rang It's me Mego:
Hello, hello, I'm calling you again
Hello Mego, it's me again

Mego:
You caught me reading a rock magazine

Celine:
Well I seem to be short of a second keyboard

Mego:
I know a cool dude who knows all your tunes
I'm telling you, he's the one for you

Celine:
Yves Coullea, here he comes
And now, to slow things off
I want to show this man off
He's the best in the land
My sound men...
And I now, I present to you
This very important dude
Mego:
That's me

Celine:
A very special addition
My lighting technician...
Oh my God, oh my God, did I forget
I hope he's not to upset

Mego:
Who me upset? hey, I never get upset, never, never, upset, me?

Celine:
You know, we have a very special relationship

Mego:

Celine:

My band and all my good friends too
This has been such great fun
Thank you, thank you, thank you, everyone!

Mego:
Wait, wait, woe, wait, wait, wait a minute
And what about me
Do you need glasses, can't you see?
You phone me constantly to set up perfectly
You say Hello, hello
(Hello, hello)

Celine:
Woe, take it easy, I'm only teasing

Mego:
