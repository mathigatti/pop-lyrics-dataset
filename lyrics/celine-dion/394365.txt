Love and harmony
Soul inspiration and prophecy
We make love and we make joy
One girl and one boy
We are everybody's eyes
Take down your guise and recognize
There's only one way
You leave me no choice
But to love you blind


People, who's leading you?
People, who's following who?
A world asleep
Is a world in deep
Ooh, yeah
We don't have to feel this way

We are the world to come
A race of love and a world of one
One mind can generate
What we anticipate
We make war when we couldn't make peace
Tell me, who is the man in the driver's seat?
There's only one way
You leave me no choice
But to love you blind

People, who's leading you?
People, who's following who?
A world asleep
Is a world in deep
Ooh, yeah
We don't have to feel this way

Take clouds from the sky
Everybody loves but we've got to try
Hold back tears, and break down chain
Let love rule again
Signs to come of what we do now
You and me, and me and you
Love is all we need tonight
Yeah, ooh
People, who's leading you?
People, who's following who?
A world asleep
Is a world in deep
Ooh, yeah
We don't have to feel this way, ooh..
