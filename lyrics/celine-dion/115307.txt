When I was a little girl 
I had a rag doll 
Only doll I've ever owned 
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll 
But only now my love has grown 


And it gets stronger, in every way 
And it gets deeper, let me say 
And it gets higher, day by day 

And do I love you my oh my 
Yeh river deep mountain high 
If I lost you would I cry 
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby 

When you were a young boy 
Did you have a puppy 
That always followed you around 
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy 
No I'll never let you down 

Cause it grows stronger, like a river flows 
And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows 
And it gets sweeter baby, as it grows 

And do I love you my oh my 
Yeh river deep, mountain high 
If I lost you would I cry 
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby 

I love you baby like a flower loves the spring 
And I love you baby just like Tina loves to sing 
And I love you baby like a school boy loves his pet 
And I love you baby, river deep mountain high 
Oh yeah you've gotta believe me 
River Deep, Mountain High 
Do I love you my oh my, oh baby 
River deep, mountain high 
If I lost you would I cry 
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
