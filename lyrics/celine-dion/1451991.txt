Everything I Do 
Jacqueline Illoz  
I know stronger I am nowadays
Intensity barely through the fates
My heart's dissipated in your serene hands
We've done it all, but we just can't go through this
fence
A thousand useless to anything, but hurt.
There are steps and steps, but so far we haven't
overcome the third


Everything I always said
And all those things that I'm keeping away;
Everything's for your own good...
Everything for together we stay.

And why? Could you tell me?
We got this power, we got that key.
We really should skip to the next step.
After that are just such good things, can you see
that?
It's possible that you're interfering at this time
If you say that don't, I'll believe, and it's fine

Everything I always said
And all those things that I'm keeping away;
Everything's for your own good...
Everything for together we stay.

Everything I always said
And all those things that I'm keeping away;
Everything's for your own good...
Everything for together we stay.

Try closing your eyes
You'll feel my mind
Don't laugh of me, I said it twice
Face my feelings
And you will know...
Just put you in my place... put you in my place...

Everything I always said
And all those things that I'm keeping away;
Everything's for your own good...
Everything for together we stay.
