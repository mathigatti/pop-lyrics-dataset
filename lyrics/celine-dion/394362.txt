If a love as strong as ours
Couldn't make it all the way
Can anything make sense at all


If a love so deep and true
Couldn't stand the test of time
Then mount everest could slide
And jeruselem could fall

Is nothing sacred anymore Is forever just another word Is a promise something people used to keep
When love was worth fighting for

If we can say good-bye
If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore? 

If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore? 

I can hear the final words
Every sentence that was said
Don't know what turned our lives around

It doesn't matter who was right
There's no justice in a dream
Never thought a heart could break
Without making any sound

Is nothing sacred anymore
Is forever just another word
Is a promise something people used to keep
When love was worth fighting for

If we can say good-bye
If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore?

If we can say good-bye
If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore? 

Our love was as certain as the dawn
As solid and save as any love could be

Our love was the star you wished upon
And you thought that I saved you
Could've sworn that you saved me

Is nothing sacred anymore
Is forever just another word
Is a promise something people used to keep
When love was worth fighting for 

If we can say good-bye
If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore

Is nothing sacred anymore
Is forever just another word
Is a promise something people used to keep
When love was worth fighting for

If we can say good-bye
If we can say good-bye
Is nothing sacred anymore

If we can say good-bye
If we can say good-bye

Is nothing sacred anymore
Is nothing sacred anymore
Is nothing sacred anymore
