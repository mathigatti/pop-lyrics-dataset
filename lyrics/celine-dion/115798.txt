I remember L.A.
Seems a lifetime ago
We were stars on sunset boulevard
What a movie we made  


There were days in the sun
That have stayed forever young
Nights when passion was invincible
We thought love would never die  

(Chorus)
There were moments in that lifetime
That my heart still replays
There were minutes, there were hours,
There were days
There are moments I still love you that
Same way
When I remember L.A.  

I remember goodbye
I watched your plane out of sight
Love was over, time to close the book
Still I go back for one last look  

(Repeat chorus)
