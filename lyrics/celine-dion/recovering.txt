I am recovering
The faith of a child
That part of my heart
That was reckless and wild


I am recovering
The hope that I lost
The part of my soul
That paid the cost

Little by little
Day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil
Oh
Take back my peace of mind

I am a recovering
Anxiety addict
A broken perfectionist
Somewhat erratic

I am a recovering
A constant regretter
Hold it against her
At least 'til forever

Little by little
Day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil
Oh
Take back my peace of mind

Hold me
As I fall apart baby
Hold me
Here in the dark
Cause the old me

Run just as far as I could from my heart
But Iâ€™m going back to the start
Little by little
Day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil
Oh

Take back my peace of mind
Tell him I love him (yes)
Take back my peace of mind
