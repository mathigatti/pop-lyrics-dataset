I'll paint my mood in shades of blue
Paint my soul to be with you
I'll sketch your lips in shaded tones
Draw your mouth to my own  


I'll draw your arms around my waist
Then all doubt I shall erase
I'll paint the rain that softly lands on
Your wind-blown hair  

I'll trace a hand to wipe your tears 
A look to calm your fears
A silhouette of dark and light
While we hold each other oh so tight  

I'll paint a sun to warm your heart
Swearing that we'll never part
That's the colour of my love  

I'll paint the truth
Show how I feel
Try make you completely real
I'll use a brush so light and fine
To draw you close and make you mine  

I'll paint the stars in the evening sky
Draw their light into your eyes
A touch of grace that softly falls on
Your moonlit face  

I'll trace your hand to hold in mine
A kiss to mark the time
A silhouette of dark and light
While we hold each other oh so tight  

I'll paint a sun to warm your heart
Swearing that we'll never part
That's the colour of my love  

I'll paint the truth
Show how I feel
Try to make you completely real
I'll use a brush so light and fine
To draw you close and make you mine  

I'll paint a sun to warm your heart
Swearing that we'll never part
That's the colour of my love  

I'll draw the years all passing by
So much to learn so much to try  

And with this ring our lives will start
Swearing that we'll never part
I offer what you cannot buy
Devoted love until we die
