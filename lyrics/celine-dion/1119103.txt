When I'm feeling down
The mention of your name
It lifts my spirits up
It makes me carry on
When I don't have the strength
Your faith can heal me


Like the sun that shines
You give me light to see

(CHORUS)
Catch me cuz I'm falling
I'm so lost inside your love
Can you hear me calling to your heart
Cuz you're the one
The reason I go on

Could I find the words
To tell you how I feel
With one look from your eyes
I know what heaven's worth
So I sell everything
To hold and touch you
You're the air I breathe
The reason my heart beats

(CHORUS)
Catch me cuz I'm falling
I'm so lost inside your love
Oh, Can you hear me calling to your heart
Cuz you're the one
The reason I go on
The reason I go on

Maybe I'm just dreaming
That my hope It keeps me strong, oh

(CHORUS)
Catch me cuz I'm falling
I'm so lost inside your love
Oh, Can you hear me calling to your heart
Cuz you're the one
The reason I go on
