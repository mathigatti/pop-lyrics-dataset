sun is creeping down 
behind the hill 
everything is calm 
everything is still 
so baby close your eyes 
and rest your weary mind 
let me hold you close 
I'll sing you this lullaby 
let your worries go 
you fall asleep 
think of nothing more 
memories will keep 
your dreams will turn to gold 
and you will wake and find 
that you hold a smile all day 
from this lullaby 
maybe somewhere in the silence 
you may wake and you're all alone 
just call and I'll be there 
even when I'm gone 
each day will end 
so I'll say good night 
till we meet again 
now baby close your eyes 
and rest your weary mind 
II'll let you know the joy you bring 
every time you hear me sing 
you this lullaby
