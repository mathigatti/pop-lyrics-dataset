I wanna be the face you see when you close your eyes
I wanna be the touch you need every single night
I wanna be your fantasy
And be your reality
And everything between


I want you to need me
Like the air you breathe
I want you to feel me
In everything
I want you to see me
In your every dream
The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you
I want you to need me, need me
Like I need you

I wanna be the eyes that look deep into your soul
I wanna be the world to you I just want it all
I wanna be your deepest kiss
The answer to your every wish
And all you ever need

I want you to need me
Like the air you breathe
I want you to feel me
In everything
I want you to see me
In your every dream
The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you
I want you to need me, need me

'Coz I need you more than you could know
And I need you to never never let me go
And I need to be deep inside your heart
I just want to be everywhere you are

I wanna be the face you see when you close your eyes
I wanna be the touch you need every single night
I wanna be your fantasy
And be your reality
And everything between...

I want you to need me
Like the air you breathe
I want you to feel me
In everything
I want you to see me
In your every dream
'Coz baby I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you

I want you to need me
Like the air you breathe
I want you to feel me
In your everything
I want you to see me
In your every dream
'Coz baby I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you
I want you to need me, need me
Like I need you
Like I need you
Like I need you
