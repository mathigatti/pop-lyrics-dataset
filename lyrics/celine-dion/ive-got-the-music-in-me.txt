Ain't got no trouble in my life,
No foolish dream to make me cry.
I'm never frightened or worried,
I know I'll always get by.
I heat up (I heat up)
I cool down (I cool down)
When something gets in my way I go round it.
Don't let life get me down
Gonna take life the way that I found it.


I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me

They say that life is a circle (circle)
But that ain't the way that I've found it.
Gonna move in a straight line (ooh)
Keeping my feet firmly on the ground.
I heat up (I heat up)
I cool down (I cool down)
I got words in my head so I say them.
Don't let life get me down,
Catch a hold of my blues and just play them.

Feel funky
Feel good
Gonna tell ya
I'm in the neighbourhood
Gonna fly like a bird on the wing
Hold on to your hat honey,
Sing, sing, sing, sing

I got the music
Pretty music
I got the music
In me
