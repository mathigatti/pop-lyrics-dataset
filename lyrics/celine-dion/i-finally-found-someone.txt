I finally found someone, that knocks me off my feet
I finally found the one, that makes me feel complete
We started over coffee, we started out as friends
It's funny how from simple things, the best things begin


This time it's different
It's all because of you
It's better than it's ever been
'Cause we can talk it through
My favorite line was "Can I call you sometime?"
It's all you had to say to take my breath away

This is it, oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one, to be with every night
'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you
My life has just begun
I finally found someone

I didn't mind
Baby, that's fine
Just to know you were mine
Sure it looks fine
Isn't it the time?
I can't wait for the rest of my life

This is it, oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one, to be with every night
'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you
My life has just begun
I finally found someone

Whatever I do, it's just got to be you
My life has just begun
I finally found someone
