Said the little lamb
To the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the night
Shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
A song, a song
High above the trees
With a voice
As big as the sea
With a voice
As big as the sea


Said the shepherd boy
To the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm
Mighty king
Do you know what I know
A child
A child shivers in the cold
Let us bring him
Silver and gold
Let us bring him
Silver and gold

Said the king
To the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace
People everywhere
Listen to what I say
A child, a child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us
Goodness and light
He will bring us
Goodness and light
