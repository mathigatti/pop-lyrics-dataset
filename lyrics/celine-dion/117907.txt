Lying in bed alone
Thinkin' 'bout how much I need you
Oh, give me one more chance to see you again
If only I'd have known
It was the last time I'd be with you
I would've held on and never let you go


Baby, just have a heart
I'm begging you
Let me show you know much I need you
Baby, just have a heart
This much is true
I miss your touch
I'm still in love with you

Here comes another day
I don't know if I can make it
Oh, I just realized it's so lonely being free
Runnin' from the pain
I'm never gonna shake it
Oh, how I need you to take it from me

I always thought that I would have the upper hand
But now I know that I'm really not that strong
If I could only make you understand
I'd give you the world but for a start...
