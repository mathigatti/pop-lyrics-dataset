Your butt is mine
Gonna take you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Come on,
Come on,
Lay it on me all right...


I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be...
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait 'till I get through...

Because I'm bad, I'm bad - come on
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it, you know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again,

You know I'm bad, I'm bad - come on
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know it, you know, you know, you know - come on
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again,
Who's bad?

Who's bad?
