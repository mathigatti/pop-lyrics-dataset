And in your eyes I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, "What's his is hers"


I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you 

I was afraid to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
The walls begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground 

I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you 

Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are 

Catch me, don't let me drop!
Love me, don't ever stop! 

So close your eyes and let me kiss you
And while you sleep I will miss you 

I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you 

Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are 

Falling into you
Falling into you
