Forty five steps in the same direction
Oh, ain't it strange we're here connecting
Don't need to understand if God's got a plan
It's out of our hands anyway


No regrets this is heaven sent
Look at where we are, it's amazing
And if you need me, I will be in your memory

Goodnight baby, kiss me now, don't make me sad
After midnight promise we'll never look back
This shit is perfect it, each second worth it
Let's save this love before we go and hurt it now
Goodnight baby, the stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye

Forty five steps in the same direction
Just take my hand, don't ask no questions
Don't need to understand if God's got a plan
It's out of our hands anyway

No regrets this is heaven sent
Look at where we are, it's amazing
And if you need me, I will be in your memory

Goodnight baby, kiss me now, don't make me sad
After midnight promise we'll never look back
This shit is perfect it, each second worth it
Let's save this love before we go and hurt it now
Goodnight baby, the stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye

'Cause I don't wanna be here without you
I'd rather just bottle time
Open up the memory and keep you by my side
I can't believe that I ever found you
Baby, take a look around
Everything is perfect now

So, goodnight baby, kiss me now, don't make me sad
After midnight promise we'll never look back
This shit is perfect it, each second worth it
Let's save this love before we go and hurt it now
Goodnight baby, the stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye, the stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye, this is the perfect goodbye
