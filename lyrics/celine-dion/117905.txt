I just wanted you to talk to me
But baby you captured my heart so easy
And I know love, baby when I see it
Boy when you're near me that's the
Feeling I get


It's pure emotion inside of me
And all I know is I feel...

Too much, too much baby all I do is think
About you night and day I feel too
Too much, too much baby don't let go 'cause
It's my heart you're takin'

The spell that I'm under I can't undo
But baby I wonder do you feel it too

A classic case of infatuation
Is it possible that I feel..

It's a serious connection when I look into your eyes
When you show me your affection, it's more than I
realized
