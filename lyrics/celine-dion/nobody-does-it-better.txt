Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby you're the best


I wasn't looking
But somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your lovelight
But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

And nobody does it better
Though sometimes i wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why d'you have to be so good?

The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnning
But just keep it coming
How'd you learn to do the things you do

And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby baby darling
You're the best
Baby you're the best
