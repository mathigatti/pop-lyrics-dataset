Waking up alone

In a room that still reminds me
My heart has got to learn to forget
Staring on my own
With every breath I'm getting stronger
This is not the time for regret
Cause I don't need to hang on to heartbreak
When there's so much of life left to live


Love is on the way
On wings of angels
I know it's true, I feel it coming through
Love is on the way
Time is turning the pages
I don't know when
But love will find me again

I am not afraid
Of the mystery of tomorrow
I have found the faith deep within
There's a promise I have made
There's a dream I'm gonna follow
There's another chance to begin
And it's coming as sure as the heavens
I can feel it right here in my heart

Love is on the way
On wings of angels
I know it's true, I feel it coming through
Love is on the way
Time is turning the pages
I don't know when
But love will find me again

(Oh I know, I know down deep in my heart I know that)

Love is on the way
On wings of angels
I know it's true, I feel it coming through
Love is on the way
Time is turning the pages
I don't know when
But love will find me again

I don't know when
But love will find me again
