Hmmmm
I get wing to fly,oh
I'm alive


When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive

When you look at me
I can touch the sky
I know that I'm alive

When you blessed the day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I'm glad that I'm alive

You've set my heart on fire
Filled me with love
Made me a woman
On clouds above

I couldn't get much higher
My spirit takes flight
'Cause I am alive

When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive

When you reach for me
Raising spirits high
God knows that

That I'll be the one standing by
Through good and through trying times
And it's only begun
I can't wait for the rest of my life

When you call on me
When you reach for me
I get wings to fly
I feel that

When you bless the day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I know that I'm alive

I get wings to fly
God knows that I'm alive
