I feel a little peculiar
Feelin' kinda strange
I don't know what it is, but I like the change
That comes over me whenever he's around
It's as if my feet don't even touch the ground


'Cause when I'm feelin' down, he's there to pick me up
And when I talk too much, he doesn't interrupt
Let me tell you, there's no better guy
This is how he makes me feel inside

I wanna dance, I wanna play
Well can you hear my heartbeat a million miles away
It won't stop, till I drop
And every day and night he tells me
I'm so special that he never could give me up

(CHORUS)
I'm hooked on a feelin' a natural high
You better believe it and the reason why
It's a thing called love
It makes me feel so alive
And I can't fight the feelin'

Somebody told me once you only get one chance
So live your life and do the best you can
Once a day goes by you never get it back
So live every minute like it was your last

And just dance, come on play
And tell somebody you love them at least once a day
And don't stop, till you drop
I didn't know that one day someone so special
Would come along to steal my heart

(CHORUS)
I'm hooked on a feelin' a natural high
You better believe it and the reason why
It's a thing called love
It makes me feel so alive

Love, love, love
And John Lennon said that was all you need
If you taste it once it won't be enough

(CHORUS)
I'm hooked on a feelin' a natural high
You better believe it and the reason why
It's a thing called love
It makes me feel so alive

I'm hooked on a feelin' a natural high
You better believe it and the reason why
It's a thing called love
It makes me feel so alive
And I can't fight the feelin'

I can't fight the feelin'
I can't fight the feelin'
Can't fight the feelin'
