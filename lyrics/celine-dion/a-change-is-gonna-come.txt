I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh, just like a river, I've been running ever since
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change's gonna come, oh, yes, it will
It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there above the sky
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change's gonna come, oh, yes, it will
And I go to the movies, and I go downtown
Somebody keep telling me, don't hang around
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change's gonna come, oh, yes, it will
Oh, when I go to my brother
I'd say
