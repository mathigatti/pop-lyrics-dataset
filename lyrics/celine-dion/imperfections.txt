I try to give all myself to you
But before I can get there
Got parts of me I'm trying to lose


Yeah I got my own imperfections
I got my own set of scars to hide
I got my own imperfections
I can't hold your heart when I'm fixing mine, so

Give it up give it up
I ain't gonna save you
Give it up, give it up now
Give it up, give it up
I ain't gonna save you
Give it up, give it up now

'Cause I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
Yeah I got my own
I got my own

Hold on, not tryna put you on the shelf
But before I could love you
I need to learn to love myself

'Cause I got my own imperfections
I got my own set of scars to hide
I got my own imperfections
I can't hold your heart when I'm fixing mine, so

Give it up, give it up
I ain't gonna save you
Give it up, give it up now
Give it up, give it up
I ain't gonna save you
Give it up give it up now

'Cause I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
Yeah I got my own
I got my own

They’re part of me, and you are too
And I don’t really wanna choose
Can you love them the way that I love you?
They make me who I am today
And they won’t ever go away
Can you love them the way that I love you?

'Cause I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
Yeah I got my own
I got my own

Before I can love you
I need to learn to love myself
Before I can trust you
I need to learn to trust myself
