(albert hammond, marti sharron)
I know i never loved this way before
And no one else has loved me more
With you i've laughed and cried
I have lived and died
What i wouldn't do just to be with you
I know i must forget you and go on
I can't hold back my tears too long
Though life won't be the same
I've got to take the blame
And find the strenght i need to let you go
Just walk away
Just say goodbye
Don't turn around now you may see me cry
I mustn't fall apart
Or show my broken heart
Or the love i feel for you
So walk away
And close the door
And let my life be as it was before
And i'll never never know
Just how i let you go
But there's nothing left to say
Just walk away
There'll never be a moment i'll regret
I've loved you since the day we met
For all the love you gave
And all the love we made
I know i've got to find the strenght to say
Just walk away
Just say goodbye
Don't turn around now you may see me cry
I mustn't fall apart
Or show my broken heart
Or the love i feel for you
So walk away
And close the door
And let my life be as it was before
And i'll never never know
Just how i let you go
But there's nothing left to say
Just walk away
