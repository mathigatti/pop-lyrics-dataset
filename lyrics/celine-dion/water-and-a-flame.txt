Seven days has gone so fast
I really thought the pain would pass
It's been nearly an hour
Since I thought of you
But your not answering the phone
I'd settle for a busy tone
At least by that I'd know that you're okay
A guy like you ain't meant to go away
Oh, no


Now you're gone, there's nothing else I want
Now that it's over, there's nothing else I want
What have I done, looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change
I guess we're like water and a flame
Water and a flame

I'm tired of this empty house
I need a drink to get me out
A couple more til I forget your name
I saw a boy that looked like you
I didn't know quite what to do
It took a power of will to break my stare
I realized what I wanted wasn't there

Now you're gone, there's nothing else I want
Now that it's over, there's nothing else I want
What have I done, looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change
I guess we're like water and a flame
Water and a flame

But your not answering the phone
I'd settle for a busy tone
At least that I'd know that you're okay
A girl like you ain't meant to go away
Oh

Now you're gone
There's nothing else I want
Now that it's over
There's nothing else I want
What have I done
Looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change
I guess we're like water and a flame
Water and a flame

And if you see me come
Look away, look away
And if your mind is vain
Look away, look away
And if you worry about me
I am ok, I am ok... Yes, I am

Now you're gone
There's nothing else I want
Now that it's over
There's nothing else I want
What have I done
Looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change
I guess we're like water and a flame
Water and a flame
