Love doesn't ask why
It speaks from the heart
And never explains
Don't you know that
Love doesn't think twice
It can come all at once
Or whisper from a distance 


Don't ask me if this feeling's
Right or wrong
It doesn't have to make much sense
It just has to be this strong
'Cause when you're in my arms I
Understand we don't have a voice
When our hearts make the choices
There's no plan
If's not in our hands 

Love doesn't ask why
It speaks from the heart
And never explains
Don't you know that
Love doesn't think twice
It can come all at once
Or whisper from a distance 

Now I can feel what you're
Afraid to say
If you give your soul to me
Will you give too much away
But we can't let this moment
Pass us by
Can't question this chance
Or expect any answers
We can try
But love doesn't ask you why 

(Instrumental)

So let's take what we found
And wrap it around us 

Love doesn't ask why
It speaks from the heart
And never explains
Now I know that
Love doesn't think twice
It can come all at once
Or whisper from a distance 

Love doesn't ask why
