I thought I had it long ago
I held on but it let go
It kissed me on a subway train
And I meant it


It got my hand
It brushed my cheek
It moved right in, it got me deep
You know, it even had a name
I really felt it

I didn't know love
Not even close
This is more beautiful and frightening
That I've ever known
It's making me weak
Making me strong
It's making me afraid I'm gonna wake up
And find it gone
I didn't know love

It's a blessing
It's a curse
You know you've found it when it hurts
It can drive you off a cliff
But it's worth it
Careful way to spend the night
It's complicated when it's right
You can make me such a mess
Yeah you're perfect
Cause I didn't know love

I didn't know love
Not even close
This is more beautiful and frightening
That I've ever known
It's making me weak
Making me strong
It's making me afraid I'm gonna wake up
And find you gone

No I didn't know love

Now you're lying in my arms beside me
In the past I'd settle for a touch
I'd tell myself it was enough
I was lying, lying, lying

Cause I didn't know love

I didn't know love
Not even close
This is more beautiful and frightening
That I've ever known
It's making me weak
Making me strong
It's making me afraid I'm gonna wake up
And find you gone
I didn't know love
