Everywhere I go
All the places that I've been
Every smile's a new horizon
On a land I've never seen


There are people around the world
Different faces, different names
But there's one true emotion
That reminds me we're the same
Let's talk about love

From the laughter of a child
To the tears of a grown man
There's a thread that runs right through us
And helps us understand

As subtle as a breeze
That fans a flicker to a flame
From the very first sweet melody
To the very last refrain...

Chorus:
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about us,
Let's talk about life
Let's talk about trust
Let's talk about love.

It's the king of all who live
And the queen of all good hearts,
It's the ace you may keep up your sleeve,
Till the name is all but lost.

As deep as any sea
With the rage of any storm
But as gentle as a falling leaf
On any autumn morn...

Chorus:
Let's talk about love,
Let's talk about us,
Let's talk about life,
Let's talk about trust.
Let's talk about love
"It's all we need"
Let's talk about us
"It's the air we're breathing"
Let's talk about life
"I wanna know you"
Let's talk about trust
"And I wanna show you"

"Everywhere I go...

Chorus
