I wasn't searching
To end this hurting
But out of nowhere
You made me feel
I cried about it
I lied about it
I tried to doubt
This could be real


You've touched me far too deep for this to be denied
Only my fear stands in our way
Oh, oh, oh

Send me a lover
Someone to believe in
Please send me someone I can hold 
Baby now
Send me a lover
A new beginning
Someone to take away the cold
And give me back
What I've been missing
All the love that waits inside your heart

It still astounds me
The way you found me
It's almost too good to be true
From our first meeting
I had the feeling
The rest of my life I'd spend with you

I just can't turn my back on what I know is true
I'm into you in every way
Oh, oh, oh

Send me a lover
Someone to believe in
Please send me someone I can hold
Oh, baby now
Send me a lover
A new beginning
Someone to take away the cold
And give me back
What I've been missing
All the love that waits inside your heart

I thought that love was only a word
That I would never feel
All the passion that I hold inside
Was just a dream
Out of your heart you spoke to me
All that I'd imagined
And I've fallen
So in love with you
Oh, oh, oh

Send me a lover
Someone to believe in
Please send me someone I can hold
Oh, baby now
Send me a lover
A new beginning
Someone to take away the cold
And give me back
What I've been missing
All the love that waits inside your heart

All the love that waits inside your heart
