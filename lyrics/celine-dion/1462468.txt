The war was over and the spirit was broken,
The hills were smokin' as the men withdrew.
We stood on the cliffs
Oh, and watched the ships
Slowly sinking to their rendezvous.


They signed a treaty and our homes were taken,
Loved ones forsaken
They didn't give a damn.
Try'n' to raise a family,
End up the enemy
Over what went down on the plains of Abraham.

Acadian driftwood,
Gypsy tail wind.
They call my home the land of snow.
Canadian cold front movin' in.
What a way to ride
Oh, what a way to go.

Sailing out of the gulf headin' for Saint Pierre,
Nothin' to declare
All we had was gone.
Broke down along the coast,
But what hurt the most
When the people there said
"You better move on".

I've worked in the fields down in New Orleans.
It was ever green up until the floods.
You could call it an omen,
Points ya where you're goin'.
Set my compass north
I got winter in my blood

J'arrive, Acadie.
J'ai le mal du pays.
