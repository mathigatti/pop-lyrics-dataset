I'm lookin' back through the years
Down this highway
Memories, they all lead up to
This one day
And many dreams lost along the way
Haunt me still
I guess they always will
When love was too much to bear
I just left it there
But here I stand face to face
With this heart of mine
Livin' without you I only fall behind
We had a love most people never find
All this time I never realized
And the courage I finally found
Has made me turn around  


(Chorus)
There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime one heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back, I'm gonna
Run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me  

I can still hear the song of your
Laughter
I can still taste the sorrow of
Your tears
We said goodbye but our hearts
Did not hear
Now my love there's nothing left
To fear
With all my heart put me through
It leads me back to you  

(Chorus)  

(Chorus)  

I'm gonna run back I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me
