He was a fast machine
He kept his motor clean
He was the best damn man that I ever seen


He had sightless eyes
Telling me no lies
Knockin' me out with those american thighs

Taking more than him share
Had me fighting for air
He told me to come, but I was already there

'Cause the walls started shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was achin'
And we were makin' it and you

Shook me all night long
Yeah you, shook me all night long

Working double time on the seduction line
He was one of a kind
He's just mine all mine

Wanted no applause
It's just another cause
Made a meal out of me, and come back for more

Tried to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing

But the walls were shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and you

Shook me all night long
Yeah you, shook me all night long
Knocked me out, I said you
Shook me all night long
Had me shaking and you
Shook me all night long
Had me shaking
Well you shook me

You really shook me and you!
Shook me all night long
Aaaaahaaaahaaaah you
Shook me all night long
Yeah yeah you
Shook me all night long
You really got me and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me
Yeah you shook me
All night long
