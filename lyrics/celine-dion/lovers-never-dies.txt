You said forever after but what came after that 
Wasn’t what I expected, I expected you back 
You said that you’re romantic, where’s the romance in this? 
It’s obvious that you’re full of it


I tried to give you time but then our time slipped away 
You said that we’d be fine but finally I’m awake 
You said it’s only habit but what happened is this 
It’s obvious I’m not havin’ it 
You say the pretty things you know I like 
But I can read between the lies 

If lovers never die 
then why do I need you? 
Bleed when I see you 
Whenever I see you it kills me inside 
Why’d you say goodbye, if lovers never die? 

I trust too easily and trusted you’d treat me well 
I faced the truth by facing you and asking for help 
You played the gentleman but there’s no gentle in this 
It’s obvious, you’re full of it
You say the pretty things you know I like 
But I can read between the lies 

If lovers never die 
then why do I need you? 
Bleed when I see you 
Whenever I see you it kills me inside 
Why’d you say goodbye, if lovers never die 

It was just a lie 
But I’ll survive 
Why do you say goodbye if lovers never die?

If lovers never die 
then why do I need you?
Bleed when I see you 
Whenever I see you it kills me inside 
Why’d you say goodbye, if lovers never die? 
Why do you say goodbye, if lovers never die?
