At last
My love
Has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like
A song


Oh yeah yeah

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I
Can call my own
A found a thrill to press
My cheek to
A thrill that I
Have ever known

Oh yeah yeah

And you smile you smile
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last
