With this tear
I thee want
I long for u to talk to me like u did
That night in the restaurant


U spoke of love so openly
And again and again u promised me
That u'd never leave
But now u're gone

With this voice
I thee call
Sometimes I catch myself
Calling your name
When u're not there at all

Please tell me what I did wrong
Why must I hear your voice inside
my head
All day and all night long
It's not fair

With these arms
I held u
When u told me u were dying
I had less courage it's true
And u wrote every day
Writing 'bout the things
That we could do
When your pain went away
But all that went away was u

With this tear
I these want
I long for u to talk to me like u did
That night in the restaurant

With this tear
I thee want
I thee want
I thee want
I thee want

With this tear
I thee want
I long for u to talk to me like u did
That night in the restaurant

U spoke ofl ove so openly
And again and again u promised me
That u'd never leave
But now you're gone

With this tear
