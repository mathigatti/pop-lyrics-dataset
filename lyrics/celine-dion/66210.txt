Celine:
I'm scared,
so afraid to show I care
Will he think me weak If I tremble when I speak ?
Oooh - what if there's another one he's thinking of
Maybe he's in love. I'd feel like a fool
Life can be so cruel
I don't know what to do


Barbara:
I've been there with my heart out in my hand
But what you must understand
You can't let the chance
To love him pass you by

Should I

Celine e Barbara:
Tell him, tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes
Reach out to him and whisper tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Barbara:
Touch him with the gentleness you feel inside
Your love can't be denied, the truth will set you free
You'll have what's mean to be
All in time you'll see

Celine:
I love him of that much I can be sure
I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say

I'll

Celine e Barbara:
Tell him, tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes
Reach out to him and whisper tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Celine:
Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows

Barbara:
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show

Celine:
Tonight love will assume its place

Barbara:
This memory time cannot erase

Celine e Barbara:
Blind faith will lead love where it has to go

Celine e Barbara:
Tell him, tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes
Reach out to him and whisper tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Never let him go
