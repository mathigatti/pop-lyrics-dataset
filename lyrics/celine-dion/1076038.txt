I couldn't live
I couldn't live without your love
For one kiss
Well, I'd give everything up
There's no words that can describe what I feel deep inside
So I let this song say it all


Then I hope you'll understand
Once you've listened to the end

(CHORUS)
Heard the music in my head
So before I could forget
I start singing
Yeah I was singing this song for you
Just made up the words, yeah

My heart wrote the melody
So I can sing this song for you
