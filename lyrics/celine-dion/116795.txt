Look at you baby
The picture of a broken man
Your confidence is shaken
The world caved in on you again
But I know what to do to ease the pain
And bring you back to life again. . .
(Don't you know)


A little bit of love
Can go a long way sometimes
A little bit of love
Is really all you need
When life gets tough you need
A little bit of love sometimes

Oh, baby, hold me
Let all that anger disappear
A little smile is showing
Something's catching fire here
And when the morning comes you'll be
good as new
You'll take this night that we've shared
With you
(Don't you know)

A little bit of love
Can go a long way sometimes
A little bit of love
Is really all you need
When life gets tough you need
A little bit of love sometimes
A little bit of love
Is stronger than anything
Words ain't enough, you need
A little bit of love sometimes

You've done it before, you'll do it again
Get up off the floor, and jump right
back in
Baby, Baby, I still believe in you
And we'll see this through
'Cause true love is on our side

A little bit, a little bit

A little bit of love
Can go a long way sometimes
A little bit of love
Is really all you need
When life gets tough you need
A little bit of love sometimes
A little bit of love
Can go a long way sometimes
A little bit of love
Is really all you need
When life gets tough you need
A little bit of love sometimes
A little bit of love
