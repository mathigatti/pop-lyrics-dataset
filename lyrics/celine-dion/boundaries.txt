We are the ones that walked to fire
And people say don’t touch, yeah, people say don’t touch
We are the ones that never listen
We can’t get burned enough, we can’t get burned enough


And there’s no boundaries
Can ever hurt you, you could never hurt me
And we’re so unique, falling in love and letting love be

You’ve got to take me to that place
You let your guard down, yeah, you let your guard down, yeah
If you don’t take me all the way
We’ll let the world down, no, can’t let the world down, no

And there’s no boundaries
I could never hurt you (now you’ve found me)
You could never hurt me (there’s no boundaries)
And we’re so unique, falling in love (now you’ve found me)
And letting love be (there’s no boundaries)

If you don’t take me all the way
We’ll let the world down, yeah
Can’t let the world down, no
Can’t let the world down, no
Can’t let the world down, no

There’s no boundaries
I could never hurt you (now you’ve found me)
You could never hurt me (there’s no boundaries)
And we’re so unique, falling in love (now you’ve found me)
And letting love be (there’s no boundaries)

Letting love be in your heart
Letting love be in your heart
Letting love be in your heart
Letting love be in your heart
Just letting love
