I will always love you 
no matter what 
no matter where you go 
or what you do 
knowing you 
you gonna have to do things your own way 
and that's okay 
so be free 
spread your wings 
and promise me 
just one thing 
(chorus) 
if you ever need a place to cry 
baby come to me 
come to me 
I've always known that you were born to fly 
but you can come to me 
if the world breaks your heart 
no matter where on earth you are 
you can come to me 
don't walk around 
with the world on your shoulders 
and your highest hopes 
laying on the ground 
I know you think 
you've gotta try to be my hero 
but don't you know 
the stars you wish upon 
they fall that's true 
but I still believe in you 
(chorus) 
and those seven seas you sail 
or the winding road you roam 
leave you lost and feeling all alone 
let my heart be your beacon home 
(chorus)
