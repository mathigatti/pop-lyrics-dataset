Cry, Baby, hmm

If you love him
You better hold on tight
You're taking your chances
If you don't treat him right


You got him wrapped around your finger
Under your thumb
At least that's what you're thinking
Until you find out you were wrong

First you cry just a little bit
Then you hide just a little bit more
And you lie just a little bit
To even up the score
If you want to keep your love, love alive
You've gotta see the signs

Yeah, Cry

Look into his eyes
And never let him go
You gotta tell him you need him
More than he'll ever know

And he'll be wrapped around your finger
Under your thumb
It really makes a difference
When you know you got his love

First you cry just a little bit (a little bit)
Then you hide just a little bit more
And you lie just a little bit (a little bit)
To even up the score
If you want to keep your love, love alive
You've gotta see the signs

Ooh

Try to love him better
For better or for worse (for better or for worse)
Tell him that you need him
And hold on till it hurts

Ooh, Oh, yeah
Baby, Ooh, Oh

Cry just a little bit (Cry just a little bit)
Cry just a little bit more (Cry just a little bit more)
Cry just a little bit (Cry just a little bit)
Lie just a little bit more (Lie just a little bit more)
