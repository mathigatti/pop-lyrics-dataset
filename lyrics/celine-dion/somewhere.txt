There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us


Somewhere
There's a time for us
Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to look, time to care

Someday!
Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere

There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow
Someday
Somewhere
