Miss Piggy:
This is my dream come true
The day has come for us to say “I do”
There’s nowhere else I’d rather be
Nothing in the world means more to me than you


I’ve waited so patiently,
I knew you were the only frog for me
Always knew this day would come
It’s written in the stars, it’s destiny

[Chorus]
So how can something so right feel so wrong tonight?
After all we’ve been through, why do I feel I don’t know you?

Miss Piggy and Kermit:
We’ll settle down and start a family
Have a mini you and a mini me
A little pink frog and a little green piggy
They’ll learn to say hello, and say goodbye
We’ll grow grey and old, and live the quiet life
Just you and I
Hand in hand we’ll stay together
Forever and ever

Miss Piggy and Celine Dion:
So how can something so right feel so wrong tonight?
After all we’ve been through, why do I feel I don’t know you?

Dr. Teeth:
How can something so right feel so wrong inside?

Floyd:
How can something so good, leave me feeling so bad?

Pepé:
How can my dreams coming true, leave me lonely and blue?

Lew Zealand:
How come the happiest day of my life is so sad?

Rowlf:
How can I feel the high when I feel so low?

Scooter:
After all we’ve been through after coming so far

Link Hogthrob:
Is this my destiny?

Beaker:
Meep meep meeo meeo meep mee

Miss Piggy and Celine Dion:
Where is the love that’s written in the stars?

All:
How can something so right feel so wrong tonight?

Miss Piggy:
After all we’ve been through, why do I feel I don’t know you?
