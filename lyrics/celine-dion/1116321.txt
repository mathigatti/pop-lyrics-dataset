I know that once in love
You don't think of the devil who's inside
And maybe there'll come one day
When you'll feel safe and I wont have the time


You'll hear what you wanna hear
Blink once I could disappear
Some rules to the game will make it right for both of us
So just say what you wanna say
I've got it to give away
we both wanna make it last so keep your eyes on me
Your eyes on me

It's not an illusion
That you're the one and I have fallen deep
I said right from the start
When we're apart you must only think of me

Temptation is all around
Take good care of what you've found
That's why when I turn around
You better keep
You better keep your eyes on me
No matter what you think I need
No matter what you once believed, if you're mine

(CHORUS)
So you better say yeah
(No matter what you think I need)
(No it doesn't really matter what you once believed)
Say yeah
(I wanna be the air you breath)
Yeah
(You better be everything you said you'd be, so you better)
Say yeah
(I wanna be the only one or we can't go on)
(No matter what you think I need)
You better keep your eyes on me

Say that you want me
Open up your heart
even if its hard
Say that you need me
Better let 'em know
Baby, don't put on a show
Say that you need me
Tell 'em how you feel
Let 'em know its real
And if you love me
Never turn your back
Gonna keep my eyes on that

Temptation is all around
Take good care of what you've found
That's why when I turn around
You better keep
You better keep your eyes on me
No matter what you think I need
No matter what you once believed, if you're mine

(CHORUS)
So you better say yeah
(No matter what you think I need)
(No it doesn't really matter what you once believed)
Say yeah
(I wanna be the air you breath)
(You better be everything you said you'd be, so you better)
(I wanna be the only one or we can't go on)
(No matter what you think I need)
You better keep
You better keep your eyes on me
You better keep your eyes on me
Eyes on me, your eyes on me
