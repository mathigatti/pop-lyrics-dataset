I listen to the sound of the rain fallin' down my window 
Prayin' for a gentle wind 
To bring my baby back again 
Tryin' to be strong but I'm not getting any stronger 
Loneliness is tearing apart this heart of mine 
I lay awake 'coz I can't take another night lonely 
It's been too long, I can't hold on no more 


Leavin' on the next plane out 
Coz I gotta see my baby 
It's been too long since I held him in my arms 
And I just won't sleep at night 
Till he's sleeping here beside me 
Here beside me again 
Gotta be with my baby 

Talking on the phone but that don't make it any better 
Nothing's gonna ease this pain 
Until I'm in his arms again 
Runnin' down the stairs there's a taxi that's waiting for me 
Loneliness I'm gonna leave you far behind 
I'd walk for days through pouring rain 
Anything to be with him 
It's been too long, I can't be strong no more 

Leavin' on the next plane out 
'Coz I gotta see my baby 
It's been too long since I held him in my arms 
And I just won't sleep at night 
Till he's sleeping here beside me 
Here beside me again 

Gotta be with him 
Gotta be by his side 
Gotta be with him 
My heart's made up my mind 

Leavin' on the next plane out 
Coz I gotta see my baby 
It's been too long since I held him in my arms 
And I just won't sleep at night 
Till he's sleeping here beside me 
Here beside me again 
'Coz I gotta see my baby 
It's been too long since I held him in my arms 
And I just won't sleep at night 
'Till he's sleeping here beside me 
Here beside me again 

Gotta be with my baby, gonna be with my baby 
Gonna take the next plane or the next train 
Gotta get there gotta see my baby 
And nothing's gonna stop me from leavin' this time 
Leavin' on the next plane out...
