When the world is sad and dreary
Like in a heaven of solid ground
When the world is cold and weary
Love can turn it around


If you only believe
Just believe in the blessings of life
In the good and the just and the fair and the right
If you only believe

If you only believe
Just believe in the blessings of life
In the pure and the sane and the truth and the light
In the power of love

If you live in fear of danger
You can bring this to an end
Just by starting helping out a stranger
Turn him into a friend
Rejoice and comfort me
And we'll flower, just implant the seed
When you give the gift of love you'll learn
That you'll get love in return

If you only believe
Just believe in the blessings of life
In the good and the just and the fair and the right
In the power of love

If you only believe
Just believe in the blessings of life
In the pure and the sane and the truth and the light
In the power of love

And if true love is what you really feel
You can erase a world of sorrow
You will find the love that you really give
Can create a great tomorrow

There's a need now for a helping hand
Family to family, one to one
Time for all of us to understand
That the job can be done

If you only believe
Just believe in the blessings of life
In the good and the just and the fair and the right
If you only believe

If you only believe
Just believe in the blessings of life
In the pure and the sane and the truth and the light
In the power of love

If you only believe
Just believe in the blessings of life
In the good and the just and the fair and the right
In the power of love

If you only believe
Just believe in the blessings of life
In the pure and the sane and the truth and the light
In the power of love
