That look in your eyes
The heated desire
Trying so hard
To turn off the fire


Old lovers make
Dangerous friends
I knew there would be trouble
If we ever met again
But here we are
Don't want to know
What's going on in your life

And I
Don't want to feel
The way i'm feeling tonight..
..here with you
Can't live with you
Can't live without you
Breaking me in two
I just can't stay away from you
I can't live with you
I can't live without you
Any way I choose
Hard as I try to be free
You're deep inside of me

Love at first touch
In the fire in the night
And when the smoke cleared
You were out of my life

You left me standing so alone in this world..
Still i'm burning for you girl
I'm still burning too
Wish i was strong enough
To walk out that door
But i'd spend all night
Wondering if the magic's still there...
...like before

I can't live with you
I can't live without you
Breaking me in two
I just can't stay away from you
I can't live with you
I can't live without you
Any way i choose
Hard as i try to be free
You're deep inside of me

How can i forget the love
Just one touch and we were on our way
We were on our way
And you know that i need you
Can't be without you

I can't live with you
I can't live without you
Breaking me in two
(breaking me in two)
I just can't stay away from you

I can't live with you
I can't live without you
(i can't live without you)
Any way i choose
(any way i choose)

I can't live with you
(i can't live with you)
I can't live without you
Can't stay away
I can't stay away

I can't live with you
I can't live without you
