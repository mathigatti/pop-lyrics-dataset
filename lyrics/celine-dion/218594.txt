What lies before me 
What stands between 
No one can tell me 
What I have seen 
Some see the tarnish 
I see the gleam 
I have to wonder 
I have to dream 


One dream can change you 
One dream can make 
All the difference 
One heart can take 
I dream of flying 
I'm in mid-air 
I have to wonder 
What's out there 

The skies the limit 
Today's the day 
(the) Heavens are still there 
When skies are gray 
Some days are better 
Than they seem 
Some days are better 
Because you dream 

On rainbows to rainbows 
On starlight to star 
To dream isn't that what 
Tomorrow is for 
Only a dreamer knows what I know 
What it's like to wonder 
And then let go 

On rainbows to rainbows 
I know what I seem 
I have to wonder 
I have to dream
