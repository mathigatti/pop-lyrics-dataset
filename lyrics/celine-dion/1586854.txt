(Dan Hill)

When I sleep through the night
I always dream that we are back together
Must be wishful thinking
Then I wake up alone
The bed seems oh so empty I start sinking
Through waves of wishful thinking


I was the one who said I needed room to breathe
You were the one who said that love was meant for you and me
I was afraid to give too much

Oh girl..
You gave the world to me
Every time we touched

When I wake late at night
I reach for your shoulder
Come up empty
Don't know what I was dreaming
Then I whisper your name
All I hear's the sound of my heart sinking
Is it only wishful thinking?

So soft your sigh, so sweet your lips
When we made love
Didn't know how happy, girl, you made me
Till you were gone

Didn't see the warning signs you gave
How could I let you go

I'd give a lifetime just to have you one more day
Ooh
Is it only wishful thinking?
Tell me I'm not dreaming
Or maybe you'll come back one day

Ooh
Is it only wishful thinking?
Only wishful thinking
Maybe you'll come back to stay
Come back baby

When the night starts to fall
I swear I hear your breathing in the darkness
I could spend my whole life dreaming

Ooh.. How our bodies would burn
One on one, I ache for your return

Don't let my heart keep sinking..
Ooh
Is it only wishful thinking?
Don't let my heart keep sinking
Or maybe you'll come back one day

Someone tell me
Is it only wishful thinking?
Or maybe you'll come back to stay
You can stay

When I sleep through the night
I always dream that we are back together
This is only wishful thinking
Hmmm...
