A street people passing by, people like we see them
Just a flow, a group, without a face, without a voice
How a strange today, something, but what?


Disobey, disobey

A street like others and the time is suspended
A stain, an error and suddenly you understand
Incredible carlessness, strange, indecent
Zora smiles, Zora smiles, Zora smiles

Zora smiles, at the sidewalks, at the cars, at the people
passing by
To racket, to walls, to bad weather
To her bare face under the wind
To her legs which dance while walking
To everything we take for granted
She goes on and blesses every moment

Sentences on the walls, crooked looks
Sometimes a few insults, she doesn't care
She gives smiles away, she receives just as much
Zora smiles, in a cheeky way
Zora smiles, in an insolent way

Zora smiles for herself, she smiles to be there
But she smiles for those, those who are there
For those women, her sisters who no longer know how to smile
Then, heart filled with tears, life filled with tears
