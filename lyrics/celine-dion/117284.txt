When you fall asleep next to me 
Then I have no doubt 
That love still exists


The indecision I have in me 
I ordered it from the moon 
To live with you 
The loneliness of each day 
That grows between tears 
That grows apart from me

To love you at all cost 
To love you at each moment 
Considering all the madness 
That runs around us

When you fall asleep next to me 
Then I have no doubt 
That love still exists 
Love still exists

The discussions between us 
Knowing whom will be blamed 
What's important to us 
In our world that is so large

Dear one, we will love each other 
Much much more... 
Beyond the violence 
Beyond the madness

Considering all the madness 
That won't stop

When you fall asleep next to me 
Then I have no doubt 
That love still exists 
Love still exists 
Love still exists
To love you at all cost 
To love you at each moment 
Considering all the madness 
That runs around us


When you fall asleep next to me 
Then I have no doubt
