My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me
Leave you blind


My love you have found peace
You were searching
For relief

You gave it all
Into the call
You took a chance and
You took a fall for us
You came thoughtfully
Loved me faithfully
You taught me honor
You did it for me

Tonight you will slip away
You will wait
For me my love

Now I am strong (Now I am strong)
You gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am whole

My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me
Leave you blind
My love, look what you can do
I am mending
I'll be with you

You took my hand
Added a plan
You gave me your heart
I asked you to dance with me

You loved honestly

Did what you could release
Aahh, oohh

I know in peace you go
I won't relieve this loss

Now I am strong (Now I am strong)
You gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am whole

(My love, beat inside me)

My love
Leave yourself behind
Beat inside me
I'll be with you
