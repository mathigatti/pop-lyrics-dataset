Empty spaces
What are we living for
Abandoned places
I guess we know the score
On and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?


Another hero
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain
In the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My make up may be flaking
But my smile
Still stays on

Whatever happens
I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache
Another failed romance
On and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?

I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning
Round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My make up may be flaking
But my smile
Still stays on

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow, but never die
I can fly, my friends

The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
(On with the show)
(On with the show)
The show
(The show must go on)
