There was a boy... 
A very strange enchanted boy 
They say he wandered very far very far 
Over land and sea 
A little shy and sad of eye 
But very wise was he 
And then one day 
One magic day he passed my way 
And while we spoke of many things 
Fools and kings 
This he said to me 
The greatest thing you'll ever learn 
Is just to love and be loved in returned 
Interlude 
The greatest thing you'll ever learn 
Is just to love and be loved in return
