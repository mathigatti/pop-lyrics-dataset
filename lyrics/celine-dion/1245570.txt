Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on.
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven.


Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven.

Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees.
Time can break your heart, have you beggin' please beggin' please.
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven.

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on 'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven.
