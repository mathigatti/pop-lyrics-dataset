This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it
Wouldn't be nothing
Nothing
Without a woman
Or a girl


You see
Man made the cars
To take us
Over the road
Man made the trains
To carry heavy loads
Man made
Electric light
To take us
Out of the dark
Man made the boat
For the water
Like Noah
Made the ark

This is a man's
A man's
A man's world
But it
Wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without
A woman or a girl

Man thinks about
A little baby girls
And a baby boys
Man makes then happy
'Cause man
Makes them toys
And after man
Has made everything
Everything he can
You know that man
Nakes money to buy
From other man

This is a man's world
But it
Wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without
A woman or a girl

He's lost
In the wilderness
He's lost
In bitterness
