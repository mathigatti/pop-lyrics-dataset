Don't think I can't feel
That there's something wrong
You've been the sweetest part of my life
For so long
I look in you eyes
There's a distant light
And you and I know
There'll be a storm tonight
This is getting serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us?


Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice.

Baby think twice
For the sake of our love, for the memory
For the fire and the faith
That was you and me
Babe I know it ain't easy
When your soul cries out for higher ground
'Cause when you're halfway up
You're always halfway down
But baby this is serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us?

Baby this serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us?
Baby!!!

Don't say what you're about to say
(No no no no)
Look back before you leave my life
(Don't leave my life)
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice!!!!!

Don't do what you're about to do
My everything depends on you
(I depend on you)
And whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice
Before you roll those dice
(Don't do it baby, no, don't do it baby)
Baby think twice
