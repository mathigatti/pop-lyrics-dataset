Deep within each heart
There lies a magic spark
That lights the fire of our imagination
And since the dawn of man
The strenght of just I can
Has brought together people all of nations
There's nothing ordinary
In the living of each day
There's a special part
Every one of us will play


Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
To bring us closer to the power of the dream
As the world gives us it best
To stand apart from all the rest
It is the power of the dream
That bring us here

Your mind will take you far
The rest is just pure heart
You'll find your fate is all your own creation
And every boy and girl
As they come into this world
They bring the gift of hope and inspiration

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn to bring us closer to the power of the dream
The world unites in hope and peace
We pray that it always be. It is the power of the dream that bring us here

There's so much strenght in all of us
Every woman,child and man
It's the moment that you think you can't
You'll discover that you can

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn to bring us closer to the power of the dream
The world unites in hope and peace
We pray that it always be. It is the power of the dream that bring us here

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn to bring us closer to the power of the dream
The world unites in hope and peace
We pray that it always be. It is the power of the dream that bring us here

The power of the dream
The faith in things unssen
The courage to embrance you fear
No matter where you are
To reach for your own star
To realize the power of the dream
To realize the power of the dream
