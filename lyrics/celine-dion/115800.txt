I know some lovers would be satisfied
With sweet "I love you's" and some
Pretty lines
But that won't get you in this
Heart of mine
No you'll never steal my heart away
With just words sweet words
That you say
It's all in the things that you do
I'm telling you  


If you what me to believe
That I'm the only one you need
I need lovin' proof
I need lovin' proof
Baby hold me in your arms
I'd show me something from the heart
Give me lovin' proof
I need lovin' proof from you, ooh baby  

And if true love you got is strong
And true
And if you love me like you say you do
Your tender touch will tell the
Honest truth
And your kiss could never tell a lie
Coz I'd see it in your eyes
There's one way to ease any doubt
I tell you now  

If you want me to believe
That I'm the only one you need
I need lovin' proof
Baby I won't be impressed
Unless I get some tenderness
Give me lovin' proof
I need lovin' proof from you, ooh baby  

(I need lovin' proof)
If the love is right
(I need lovin' proof)
Prove it to me all night
(I need lovin' proof)
From you
'Coz you'll never steal my heart away
With just words sweet words
That you say
It's all in the things that you do
I'm telling you, telling you baby  

(chorus)
