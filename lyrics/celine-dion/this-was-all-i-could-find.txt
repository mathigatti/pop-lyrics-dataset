This is the time there are, I though, place
Made up my mind, I'm living today
Don't wait the past, there's no mistake
There's no looking back, I'm not going in that way
I just know it's right this time
There's no holding back


This time I'm going higher
Above the clouds on fire
Flying, flying
The feeling's getting stronger
My heart beats like the thunder
Calling, calling
It's for real. It's for real
Can you feel it?
It's for real, it's for real
Can you feel it?

Every step of the way it is an opportunity
A chance to live, a chance to learn
Making the most of every turn
I just know it's right this time
There's no holding back

This time I'm going higher
Above the clouds on fire
Flying, flying
The feeling's getting stronger
My heart beats like the thunder
Calling, calling
It's for real. It's for real
Can you feel it?
It's for real, it's for real, can
you feel it?
