Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly


Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Niether one prepared

Beauty and the beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Never just as sure
As the sun will rise

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Never just as sure
As the sun will rise

Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song

Bitter sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

Certain as the sun
(Certain as the sun)
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme

Beauty and the Beast

Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme

Beauty and the beast
