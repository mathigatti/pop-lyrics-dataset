O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices


O night divine
Oh, the night when Christ was born
O night divine
Oh, night
Oh night divine

Truly he taught us to love one another
His law is love and his gospel is peace
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all within hearts we praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord
Then ever, ever praise we
