You're pushing love away
When it throws you a rope
You keep turning the pages
'Cause you're losing hope


You always put a cap on your fire
You think that everyone is a liar
You gotta let that thinking go
Stop saying: No, no, no

Say yes once more
You deserve to feel that rush again
Say yes once more
Let it touch you like it did back then
Remember the good times
Let go of the pain
Say yes

When he wants to talk
You got nothing to say
When he turns and smiles at you
You turn away

You always put a cap on your fire
Always holding back your desire
You gotta let your feelings show
Stop saying: No, no, no

Say yes once more
You deserve to feel that rush again
Say yes once more
Let it touch you like it did back then
Oh, remember the good times
Let go of the pain
Say yes (say yes)
Say yes (say yes)
Say yes
Oh (say yes)
Oh (say yes)
Say yes

Remember the good times
Let go of the pain

Say yes
Say yes
