I want to know why
You're letting this die
Without the blink of an eye
You say that you need time
I say you'll be fine


If you could only see
Like you did before
You became imprisoned
Can I reopen the door?

You say it doesn't matter
Then tell me what does?
And why it isn't what
You've been thinking of
You say it's never easy
Then tell me what was?
Is it never worth the pain?
Could you believe it was?
When life keeps living
That's what life keeps giving to us

Once we were one mind
Drifting in one time
And ever true we were friends
But something's gone from my
Picture of this life

If we could only see
Like we did before
You became imprisoned
Can I reopen the door?

You say it doesn't matter
Then tell me what does?
And why it isn't what
You've been thinking of
You say it's never easy
Then tell me what was?
Is it never worth of pain?
Could you believe it was?
When life keeps living
That's what life keeps giving to us

The hope has vanished from your eyes
You are my faith and one truth
There's every reason to get through
And you're why I know there's a reason

If we could only see
Like we did before
We'd became impressioned
Can I reopen the door

You say it doesn't matter
Then tell me what does?
And why it isn't what
You've been thinking of
You say it's never easy
Then tell me what was?
Is it never worth of pain?
Could you believe it was?

You say it doesn't matter
Then tell me what does?
And why it isn't what
You've been thinking of
You say it's never easy
Then tell me what was?
Is it never worth of pain?
Could you believe it was?
When life keeps living
That's what life keeps giving to us
To us
To us
Keep on living
