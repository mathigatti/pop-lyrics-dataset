Princess, painless
Empty pillow cases
One love too blind
I helped you, felt you
Shook you passed I love you's
My scars, your lies
Oh cause
I can't believe in every word you're saying
Wrapped up in every kiss you've poisoned
I could swear I've never tasted sin
But If I just knew
I'll forget what you've done
But I can't save your soul
I won't preach, I won't judge
Save your soul
You could get on your knees
But I can't save your soul
Baby just let me be
Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul
Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul


Black teeth, screaming
No more slick concealing
No drugs, no love
Now I can't hear you
No I don't need even know you
Doors shut, case closed

How could I
Keep believing every word you're sayin'
Wrapped up in every kiss you've poisoned
I could swear I never saw the sin
But If I just knew
I'll forget what you've done
But I can't save your soul
I won't preach I won't judge
Save your soul
You could get on your knees
But I can't save your soul
Baby just let me be
Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul
Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul
I'll forget what you've done
But I can't save your soul
I won't preach I won't judge
Save your soul
You could get on your knees
But I can't save your soul
Baby just let me be
Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul
Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul
