I don’t want another piece of your mind
So take it somewhere else for the night
'Cause I can’t take another goodbye


If you wanna fight, bite your tongue
Before you explode, don’t let this get out of control
You don’t want me to leave you alone

When somebody loves somebody
That’s the way it’s supposed to be
Because you know
Nobody else would put up with your games
I don’t believe in love, if you don’t wanna go
That’s not the way it is
When somebody loves somebody
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
When somebody loves somebody

Wait, I am hearing every word that you say
You wonder if you made a mistake
It’s written all over your face

You know it’s too late
We’ve already fallen in love
Tell me is it asking too much
For you to sticking it out when it’s tough
Is it ever enough?

When somebody loves somebody
That’s the way it’s supposed to be
Because you know
Nobody else would put up with your games
I don’t believe in love, if you don’t wanna go
That’s not the way it is
When somebody loves somebody
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
When somebody loves somebody

Some people live their lives
Never believe in love
I don’t want that for us

When somebody loves somebody
That’s the way it’s supposed to be
Because you know
Nobody else would put up with your games
I don’t believe in love, if you don’t wanna go
That’s not the way it is
When somebody loves somebody

When somebody loves somebody
That’s the way it’s supposed to be
Because you know
Nobody else would put up with your games
I don’t believe in love, if you don’t wanna go
That’s not the way it is
When somebody loves somebody

When somebody loves somebody
