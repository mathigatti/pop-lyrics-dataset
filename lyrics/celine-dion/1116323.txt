Jesus
I will follow for each day is forgiving
And never alone
And as we walk through miles of disbelief
It will be his hand that guides you
Leading you home


You carry on
A new day will come
You carry on
A new day will dawn

I am woman
A mountain I will climb
Oh yes I will
I've been beat down and I've been broken
But each day I give it another try

We will carry on
A new day will come
We will carry on
A new day will dawn
