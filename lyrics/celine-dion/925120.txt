I knew I loved you
Before I knew you
The hands of time
Would lead me to you


An evening star
Was from afar
It guided me here
It knew you'd be here

Now wrapped in moonlight
At last together
Here in the incandescent glow
We are all we need to know
As we softly please each other
'Til the stars and shadow glow
And we sleep
With our dreams around us.

Oooohhhh ahhhhhh
Ooohhhhohhhh

It guided me
It knew you'd be here

I knew I loved you
Before I found you
I knew I'd built my world around you
Now all my days
And all my nights
And my tomorrows
Will all begin
And end
With you...
With you.
