If I was the sun
I would shine my light
To light your world
If I was the rain
I would wash your tears away
I'd keep your world bright
Be your light in the night
If I was the sky
I would bring down love into your life
If I was the river
You would be my ocean
Every stream would lead me to your arms and
If I was the river
I'd flow to you forever
Love would run forever in this heart of mine
If I was a river
If I was the wind
I would carry you above the clouds
And if I was the earth
I would be your solid ground
If I could, I'd be all you ever need
I would be your world
You're the only world there is for me
If I was the river
I'd flow to you forever
Love would run forever in this heart of mine
