People are sayin'
That boy is gonna hurt you
His kind of love is not for real
He's only playin'
Foolin' with your heart girl
But I know how he makes me feel
And I don't need any other proof
They just don't understand
They don't know the truth
*(refrao)
Momma says he's bad for me
Poppa says I'll be sorry
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
And all my friends doubt him
Tell me I should live without him
Everybody's talkin' my baby down 


He's not like the others
Nobody wants to see it
They don't even wanna try 

Judge a book by its cover
And you'll never know the story
There's so much more than meets the eye
Oh and I know his heart is true
I don't need anyone
To tell me what to do 

(chorus)
My sisters and my brothers
Tell me I should find another
Everybody's talkin' my baby down 

Oh but they can't feel his touch
They can't feel his kiss
They don't know what it's like to be
Loved like this
I don't care about their point of view
'Cause it's understood
When the love is good
Nothin' else is gonna do 

(chorus) 

No they don't know what he's all about
Everybody just wanna talk my baby down
No they cant' see that his heart is gold
Everybody wanna treat my baby so cold,
So cold 

(chorus)
