In a never ending circle
I've been sheltering a dream
I could climb over a rainbow
To a place I haven't been


Never felt this way before
Trusting you I feel so sure
Now we are behind closed doors
The way you made me feel

Reveal

What we do in privacy
Make a woman out of me
When you're close it feels so right
You and I reveal tonight

Take me from this lonely river
Home into the open see
Never felt this way before
In your hands I'm free to fall
Show what's underneath it all
The way you make me feel

Reveal

What we do in privacy
Make a woman out of me
When you're close it feels so right
You and I reveal tonight

And every breath I take
I feel you here inside me
Each night I lie awake
Dreaming you will find me

And every brand new morning
You're the sun that's dawning
And I love that landslide
Feels so good I want to cry

Never felt this way before
In your hands I'm free to fall
Show what's underneath it all
The way you make me feel

Reveal

What we do in privacy
Make a woman out of me
When you're close it feels so right
You and I reveal tonight

Reveal

What we do in privacy
Make a woman out of me
When you're close it feels so right
You and I reveal tonight

Let me reveal myself
Let me reveal myself
Let me reveal myself
Let me reveal myself
