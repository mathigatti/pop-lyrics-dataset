Come and go with me
Wherever I am I want you to be
Walking with your jand in mine
Feel so fine


When I'm close to you
I know what it means to want to be true
Never felt this way before
Is there more

Are you feeling the same as me, honestly
Don't you think it's unreal
I'm not dealing in fairy tales, if this fails
I don't know what on earth I will do, coz I'm

Halfway to heaven
Let's go all the way
I don't wanna give it up
Cause I'm already falling in love

When we reach that place
i'm dying to see the smile on your face
I'm so sure you'll want to stay
That's okay

I have so many dreams to share, please be there
let me share them with you
If you're looking for happiness, nothing less
Come with me baby I'm looking too, and I'm

Halfway to heaven
Let's go all the way
I don't wanna give it up
Cause I'm already falling in love
Halfway to heaven
Let's go all the way
I don't wanna give it up
Cause I'm already falling in love

i don't want to give my life in moderation (baby no)
I'm prepared to give myself up to temptation
It's time
I could use a little love and inpiration (baby now)
Come and share the joy and join the celebration
It's time
I'm hoping and praying that soon you'll be saying be mine

I don't want to give it up
Cause I'm already falling in love
Halfway to heaven
Let's go all the way
I don't wanna give it up
Cause I'm already falling in loveYou're making all my senses come alive
