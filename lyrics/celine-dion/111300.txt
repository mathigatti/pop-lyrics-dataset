Close your eyes
Have no fear
The monster's gone
He's on the run and your mommy's here


(Chorus)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy

Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way
It's getting better and better

(Chrous)

Out on the ocean sailing away
I can hardly wait
to see you come of age
but I guess we'll both just have to be patient
Cuz it's a long way to go
A hard row to hoe
Yes it's a long way to go but in the meantime

Before you cross the street
Take my hand
Life is what hapenns to you
While you're busy making other plans

(Chorus)

Before you go to sleep, say a little a prayer
Ev'ry day, in ev'ry way
It's getting better and better

(Chorus)
