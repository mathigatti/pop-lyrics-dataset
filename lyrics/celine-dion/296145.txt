I've got the world on a string 
Sitting on a rainbow 
Got the string around my finger 
What a world what a life 
Ooh I am in love 


I've got this song that I sing 
I can make the rain go 
Anytime I move my finger 
Lucky me can't you see 
I am in love 

Life is a beautiful thing 
As long as I've got a hold of that string 
I'd be a silly so-and-so 
If I should ever let go 

I got the world on a string 
Sitting on a rainbow 
Got the string around my finger 
Lucky me can't you see 
I am in love
