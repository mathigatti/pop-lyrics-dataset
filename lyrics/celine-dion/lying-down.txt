Oh I didn't mean to fall in deep
But I've no regrets
You tried to push me down, you tried to keep me possessed


I gave you my heart, you took the key
But now I paid my debt
It's time I left

And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I've just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won’t take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now, I won't take it lying down

All it takes is one bold move to change everything
All it takes is loving you to forget, forgive
But I'm having some kind of breakthrough
I'm ready to live

And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I've just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won’t take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now, I won't take it lying down

I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down

You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won’t take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now, I won't take it lying down

I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
