To lead a better life

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of his hand
Nobody can
Deny that there's somethin' there
There, running my hands through his hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but he doesn't know she's there


I want him everywhere and if he's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love him is to need him everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there
I'll be there
I want him everywhere and if he's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love him is to need him everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there... and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
