First when there's nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind


All alone I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel,
Made of stone

Well, I hear the music,
Close my eyes, feel the rhythm,
Wrap around, take a hold
Of my heart

What a feeling
Bein's believin'
I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life

Now I hear the music,
Close my eyes, I am rhythm
In a flash it takes hold
Of my heart

What a feeling
Bein's believin'
I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive, now I'm dancing through my life
What a feeling

What a feeling I am music now
Bein's believin'. I am rhythm now
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life.
What a feeling. You can really have it all
What a feeling. Pictures come alive when I call
I can have it all I can really have it all
Have it all pictures come alive when I call
Call call call call what a feeling
I can have it all bein's believin'
Bein's believin' take your passion, make it happen
Make it happen what a feeling
What a feeling bein's believin', what a feelin'
