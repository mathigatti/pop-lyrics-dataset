Hard to look at pictures on the wall
Hard to pick the phone up when you call
Hardly talking anymore 'cause a single word could start a war
Once upon a time we had it all


Who would’ve known the future wasn't for us
Fools, we got it wrong
Thinking that we lean on love
But look at us now
Look at us now

How can we hold it together
When we're falling apart
Can’t put my finger on the way, the why, the how
How can we see to forever
When we're lost in the dark
You know it's killing me to say it out loud
Look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground

Back to back, we sleep on separate sides
Back and forth we slowly lose our minds
Backing out the driveway feels like this goodbye could be for real
Once upon a time time was on our side

Who would've known the future wasn't for us
Fools, we got it wrong, so wrong

How can we hold it together
When we're falling apart
Can't put my finger on the way, the why, the how
How can we see to forever
When we're lost in the dark
You know it’s killing me to say it out loud
Look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground
And you can’t even look at me now
Oh baby, look at us now

Who would've known the future wasn’t for us
Fools, we got it wrong
Thinking that we lean on love
But look at us now
Look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground
