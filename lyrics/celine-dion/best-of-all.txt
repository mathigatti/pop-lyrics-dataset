Sun going down
Leaving pearls on the skyline
Did you just do what you did
Feel like I can feel for the first time


Every tiny light in your eyes
Every flicker, every thought going by
Is it madness?
Is it the worst kind of madness?

No, It's the best of all
Nobody looked at me like that before
Nobody's every fallen when I fall
On my knees in the streetlight at your door
Is it wrong to be sure?
Oh no
It's the best of all

All of my life I've been blown by the wind
In and out of lonely places
Washed up everywhere
But now I know where I'm going
Is it madness?
Is it the worst kind of madness?

No, It's the best of all
Nobody looked at me like that before
Nobody's every fallen when I fall
On my knees in the streetlight at your door
Is it wrong to be sure?

No, it's the best of all
It's not just my heart you have my whole damn world
You wanna know, you wanna know what I'm feeling
Ten feet tall
On my knees in the streetlight at your door
Is it wrong to be sure?
Oh no
It's the best of all
