Happy to meet you
Happy to say hello
You're someone
I'd like to know
That's very clear to see


I'm happy to meet you
Glad that you
Wandered by
No need to be too shy
It's only you and me

And though we don't
Know each other very well
Somehow it's not
Too soon to tell
Our friendship is
Gonna grow
Who knows how far
It may go?

Oh, so happy
To meet you
And as the days go by
A possible you and I
Will meet and then
We'll say happy
To meet you
Again and again

Happy to meet you
Happy to say hello
You're someone
I'd like to know
That's very clear to see

I'm happy to meet you
Glad that you
Wandered by
No need to be too shy
It's only you and me

And though we don't
Know each other very well
Somehow it's not
Too soon to tell
Our friendship is
Gonna grow
Who knows how far it may go?

Oh, so happy
To meet you
And as the days go by
A possible you and I
Will meet and then
We'll say happy
To meet you
Again and again
