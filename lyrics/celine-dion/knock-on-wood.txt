I don't wanna lose
This good thing
That I got
If I do now
I would surely
Surely lose a lot
'Cause your love
Is better
Than any love I know


It's like thunder
Lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock, on wood baby

I'm not superstitious
About you
But I can't take no chance
You got me spinning baby
You know I'm in a trance
'Cause your love
Is better
Than any love I know

It's like thunder
Lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, on wood baby

No secret
That man
Fills my lovin' cup
He sees to it
That I get enough
Just one touch
Is better
You know it means so much

It's like thunder
Lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, on wood baby

Better knock
I think you better knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
