Somewhere tonight, we come alive
Two hearts ignite, we're one of a kind


Here we are
Undivided by anithing just you and I
We've come so far
No one else could ever steal away what we confide
Who wants to know?

We stick together, we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
We do it in Unison

We come together and stronger we are
Just when the world can tear us apart
We go on as one
We do it in Unison

Gleam of an eye, flash of a smile
Never too shy, playin' ever so wild

Here we are
I'm relying on no one else but you and I
We've come so far
No one else could ever steal away what we confide
Who wants to know?

We stick together, we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
We do it in Unison

We come together and stronger we are
Just when the world can tear us apart
We go on as one
We do it in Unison

Stay together! Uh, baby!
Unison! (Stay together)
Stay together, you and me!
(Stay together, stay together)

Here we are undivided by anything
Just you and I
We've come so far no one else could ever
Steal away what we confide
Who wants to know?

We stick together, we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
We do it in Unison

We come together and stronger we are
Just when the world can tear us apart
We go on as one
We do it in Unison

We stick together, we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
We do it, do it, do it
in Unison

We come together and stronger we are
Just when the world can tear us apart
We go on as one
We do it in Unison
