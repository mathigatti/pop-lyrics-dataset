You don't have to give me rings on
My fingers
Promise me the moon and stars
In the sky
Or bring me roses just to show me
You love me
That ain't gonna win this heart of mine
All the diamonds you can buy won't
Impress me
Pretty words ain't gonna prove
Your love
I need more than just tokens
Of affection
I'm not asking for too much now baby
I don't need no fancy cars
Just need something from the
Heart... Whoa  


I need real emotion
Feel, gotta feel it inside
Give me that real emotion
'Coz I need some
Need to feel some tonight
Give me a love that's genuine
Real emotion, real emotion  

Show me something that my heart can
Believe in
Initation love don't mean a thig
Baby it's got to be the real thing
Or nothing
Show me that's it gonna be now baby
I'm not asking much you
Just a love that's deep and true...whoa  

I need real emotion
Feel, gotta feel it inside
Give me that real emotion
'coz I need some
Need to feel some tonight
Give me a love that's genuine
Real emotion, real emotion  

Not a cheap imitation of love
I need something that's real
I can feel in my heart baby
I've been waiting so long
For a love, for a love, for a love
That's strong
I don't need no fancy cars
Just need something from the
Heart...Whoa  

(chorus)
