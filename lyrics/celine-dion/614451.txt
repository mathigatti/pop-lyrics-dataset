I understand that you've met someone
With a perfect heart
But you've been questioned by everyone
Are you in the dark
Can you choose to fall
Should you risk it all


How'm I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I'm on your side
And I understand you're the only one to know
Whether wrong or right
Let your heart decide

Some may tell you don't take the risk
It's a waste of time
But if you think you'll find happiness
Baby take the dive

It's unusual
But it's critical

How'm I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I'm on your side
And I understand you're the only one to know
Whether wrong or right
Let your heart decide

Give it up
How'm I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I'm on your side
And I understand you're the only one to know
Whether wrong or right
Let your heart decide (you're the only one)
