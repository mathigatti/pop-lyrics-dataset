If you ever leave me
Life will go on
Stars will still be
Bright as diamonds in the sky now
Even if you said goodbye now
Oh, the clock wouldn't stop, no
That sun would still keep shining down
If you weren't here with me
This world would still be spinnin' round
But, baby, there would be 


Just no living without loving you
How-would I ever survive?
Just would living without loving you
It would be like living without being
Alive without you 

If you leave walk out this door
What would I have left to live for?
What would there be left to do now  ?
What would I be without you now?
Oh, the clock wouldn't stop, no
Each day would go on just the same
There would still be air to breathe
It wouldn't stop the sun and rain
But, baby, there would be 

Just no living without loving you
How would I ever survive?
Just no living without loving you
It would be like living without being
Alive without you

That sun would still keep shining down
If you weren't here with me
This world would still be spinnin' round
But you know I would have nothing
Won't have no life if I don't have
Your loving
If I don't have you with me
Baby, there would be 

Just no living without loving you
How would I ever survive?
Just no living witohut loving you
It would be like living without being
Alive without you
