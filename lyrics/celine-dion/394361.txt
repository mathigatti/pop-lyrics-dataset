Here we are 
Face to face
We forget, time and place
Hold me now
Don't let go
Though it hurts and we both know
Want to stop the time from passing by
Want to close my eyes and feel
Your lips are touching mine
Baby when you're close to me
I want you more each time
And there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you
You
