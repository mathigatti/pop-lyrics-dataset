Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos


Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know
How to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Although it's been said
Many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Although it's been said

Merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
To you
