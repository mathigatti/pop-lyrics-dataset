Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories
Of the way we were


Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Or has time re-written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we? Could we?

Memories
May be beautiful and yet
Whatâ€™s too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget

So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were
