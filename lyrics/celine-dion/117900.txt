Sorry I know I'm late
Guess I lost all track of time
Started walking and couldn't stop turning it over in
My mind
Trying to make some sense of it
Trying to make the pieces fit
I thought I covered my tracks so well
But now he says he knew about it from the start
Yeah he knew about us all along


If there was any other way love
Don't you think I've tried to find it
Don't you think I want to say
If there was any other way love
There's no way out of this
There just ain't any other way

Maybe I'd better be leaving now
But there's something I want you to understand
Before I go
Sometimes we don't have a choice when we play and
Break the rules
I just had to see you darlin', one more time
If only just to say good-bye
'Cos he knew about us all the time

I never wanted it to be like this
I never meant to get serious
But now the thought of losing you
Takes some getting used to
