Couldn’t breathe, couldn’t breathe, it was high tide
Couldn’t leave, couldn’t leave, felt the night sky closing in
Closing in on me
Couldn’t scream, couldn’t dream, only nightmares
Pity me, couldn’t see, for the darkness closing in
Closing in on me


See a need, fill the need
See a need, fill the need
You said
See a need, fill the need
You said
See a need

Until now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I've been living in a heart of glass
Until now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass

Keep me safe in your loving, embracing arms
Kiss your face still there’s no more to say
I’ll hold you near
I’ll hold you near to me

See a need, fill the need
See a need, fill the need
You said
See a need, fill the need
You said
See a need

Until now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I've been living in a heart of glass
Until now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass

Oh you took a chance on me
Risk and your hands may bleed
Risk and your hands may bleed
Yeah
Oh you took a chance on me
Risk and your hands may bleed
Risk and your hands may bleed

Until now (you said)
I was living in a heart of glass (you said)
I was living in a heart of glass (you said)
I've been living in a heart of glass (oh baby)
Until now (he said)
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass

Until now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I've been living in a heart of glass
Until now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I've been living in a heart of glass

Heart of glass
Heart of glass
Until now
Until now
Oh I can breathe now
