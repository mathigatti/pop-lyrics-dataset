If your shoes refuse to shine
And your legs they don't walk in line
And tomorrow is just some other time, yeah


That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman working on you

If your feet can't find the floor
And your key won't fit the door
And you've forgotten that two 2s are four, yeah

That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman working on you Oh, oh yeah, now

And I've seen you wandering, baby
Up and down my street, yeah
Try to explain that love is pain to all the people that meet
Searching for that imperious, mysterious femme fatale kind of stuff, yeah
If you don't know by now that it's me anyhow
And that baby, you've got it rough

So if your praying gets so confused
And you're TV is blowing the fuse
Just come on over
You've got nothing to lose

That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman working on you
Working on you, working on you, working on you

Cuz I need, I need a man to love me
Because I need, I need a man to love, yeah
Respect me, protect me, roll over, run away to other towers
Buy me a bunch of flowers and love

That's just the woman in me baby, yeah
Working on you, working on you, working on you
I need a man to love, I need a man to love
