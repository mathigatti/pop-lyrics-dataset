Forget me not
Baby baby
As I rock you gently
Right here in my arms
I promise to always
Be here for you
Keep you safe and warm


Sometimes in the middle of the night
I wake up cryin' when I think of how long
It took to find you
And now that I have I won't be movin' on
Nothing can ever separate us
We know where we belong

All I'm asking you
All I'm asking
Before this moment's gone

Forget me not
Don't forget what we got
Every day is surely but a dream
I found the sweetest of all things
For all my life
You'll be my light
With every beat that's in your heart
Oh baby please remember to
Forget me not

Time is funny
Time can fly
That's one thing for sure
I'll wake tomorrow
Blink my eyes
See you standin' at that door

All I'll be lookin' at you
See the wonder of what love can be
Someday I might have to let you go
And that's just so hard to believe
And if I do you'll know just
How much you mean to me
And all I'll ask of you
All I'll ask you
Before I set you free

Forget me not
Don't forget what we got
Every day is surely but a dream
I found the sweetest of all things
For all my life
You'll be my light
With every beat that's in your heart
Oh baby please remember to
Forget me not

(just remem-remember to forget me)
(just remem-remember to forget me)
Forget me not (just remem-remember to forget me not)
Forget me not (forget me not forget me)

(just remem-remember to forget me)
Don't forget me baby (just remem-remember to forget me)
(just remem-remember to forget me not)
(forget me not forget me)

Before I see you free yeah

Forget me not (oh baby don't you dare forget me)
Don't forget what we got (don't forget forget what we got)
Every day is surely but a dream
I found the sweetest of all things
Forever more (remember me as a soul connection)
I'll thee adore (somebody who lit up the day)
With every beat that's in your heart (every beat that's in
my heart)
Forget me not

Don't forget what we got
With every beat that's in your heart
Oh baby please remember to
Forget me not

(just remem-remember to forget me)
(just remem-remember to forget me)
(just remem-remember to forget me not)

(just remem-remember to forget me)
(just remem-remember)
Forget me not
