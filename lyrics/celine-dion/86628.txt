Used to be easy, used to have truth hangin round
Never had secrets, always singing your praises now good and loud
All I got is questions, and you left me wondering why
Why you keep your distance, every lonely night


When love was bound together
We lived it by the letter
Cant close my eyes forever
Cos everything has changed and now

I aint gonna look the other way
One more time
Cos after all the clouds go by, its just another empty sky
I aint gonna wait to see the rain
no,no
Nothins gonna make it right, look at me cos I choose life

Its all about giving, its not about winning the game
My mind was open, ready or not you closed it up again
Still I keep asking, if you got something to hide
I never stop learning, all the reasons why

It took about a minute
To find the point and hit it
Gotta take this life and live it
Cos everyting has changed and now

When all the lights go out so suddenly, I loose my way
Baby tell me
Is something going on
You gotta free me, this time I'm gonna be strong
