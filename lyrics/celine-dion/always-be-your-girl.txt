Listen to my heartbeat and I
Try to follow where it leads me, that's right
I don't wake up in the shadows anymore
I can finally breathe


I dig a little deep down searching
Took a little time to work it through
But I found everything
The day that I had you

I, once, was the lost one
Like a wayward child
Now you're the light
That leads the way

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I'll fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it
Better than it was for me

You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world
Since you're my boy, I'll always be your girl

I'm picking up all the pieces
When I put'em back together, I'm like new
Perhaps my greatest wish
Has already come true

We'll always be connected, baby
Like a button to a sleeve
And this lullaby
Will send you off to sleep

It's hard to imagine
My life before you
'Cause you're the light
That leads the way

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I'll fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it
Better than it was for me

You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world
Since you're my boy, I'll always be your girl

I'll be holding the wrap if you tumble and fall
There is love after love after all

We'll always be connected, baby
Like a button on my sleeve
And this lullaby

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I'll fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it
Better than it was for me

You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world
Since you're my boy, I'll always be your girl
Your girl
