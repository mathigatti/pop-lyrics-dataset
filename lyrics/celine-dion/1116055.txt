I Got Nothin' Left

Anybody ever tell you that you're not home
Hollow shell of a man without a soul
Never ever felt your warmth 'cause you're always cold
Only thing that makes sense is letting go


Anybody ever tell you that you've got nerve
Treating my love like just another word
Tired of giving love to you that you don't deserve
So this is my way of saying it's over

(CHORUS)
'Cause I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left
I gave you my best and you treated it worthless
So I've got nothing

Anybody ever tell you that you're gonna learn
Trust and respect are two things you must earn
When it came to loving me you just weren't concerned
You never gave a damn so I guess it's my turn

(CHORUS)
'Cause I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left
I gave you my best and you treated it worthless

So done with you
Baby, we're through
So done, we're through

(CHORUS)
'Cause I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left
I've got nothing left
I gave you my best and you treated it worthless
So I got nothing left
So done, we're through
