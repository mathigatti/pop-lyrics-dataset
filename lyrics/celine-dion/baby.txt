I don’t want to wait too long, wait too long
So what do I do?
I don’t want to take this time, to look inside
It hurts when I do
I don’t wanna feel this pain, feel this pain
It burns my eyes to
Crying is the only thing that gets me through
Besides calling for you
Calling for you
Calling for you
Calling for you
Besides calling for you


Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Come to me
Come to me

I don’t wanna think too much, think too much
But that’s what I do
Missing you is all I know, when you were close
I felt every move
Now I don’t wanna feel this pain, I stay up late
And fall right into
Crying is the only thing that gets me through
Besides calling for you
Calling for you
Calling for you
Calling for you
Besides calling for you yeah

Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Come to me
Come to me

Besides calling for you
Calling for you
(I don’t want to wait) Calling for you
(I don’t want to wait too long) Calling for you
(I don’t want to wait) Calling for you
Besides calling you Baby

Oh Baby (Calling for you)
Oh Baby (Oh)
I don’t want to wait too long
Oh Baby (Oh I don’t want to wait, I dont want to wait, wait too long)
Come to me
Come to me
I don’t want to wait too
