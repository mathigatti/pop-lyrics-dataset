A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little cafe just around the bend


I am calling you
Can't you hear me
I am calling you

A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we both know a change is coming
Come in closer, sweet release

I am calling you
I know you hear me
I am calling you, oh
