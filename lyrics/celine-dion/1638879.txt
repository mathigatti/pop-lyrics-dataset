[Justin Beiber]
There comes a time
When we head a certain call
[Nicole Scherzinger &amp; Jennifer Hudson]

There are people dying
[Jennifer Nettles]
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
[Josh Groban]
We can't go on
Pretending day by day
[Tony Bennet]
that someone, somehow will soon make a change
[Mary J Blige]
We are all a part of
God's great big family
And the truth, you know love is all we need


[Chorus]
[Michael Jackson]
We are the world
We are the children

We are the ones who make a brighter day

There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Miley Cyrus]
Send them your heart
So they'll know that someone cares
[Enrique Iglesias]

That a change can only come
[Fergie]

[Rapping - LL Cool J, Will-I-Am, Soop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beatz]
We all need somebody that we can lean on
when you wake up look around and see that your dreams gone
when the earth quakes we'll help you make it through the storm
when the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
we are the World united by love so strong
when the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
a guided light on the dark road your walking on
a sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
we are the World connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet sing it along

[Chorus - All]

[Kanye West]
Everyday citizens
everybody pitching in

[Singing - Children &amp; Wyclef Jean]

[Will-I-Am]
You and I
You and I
[Kanye West]
Uh, 12 days no water
wishing will to live
[Will-I-Am]
we amplified the love we watching multiple
[Kanye West]
Feeling like the Worlds end
we can make the World win
[Will-I-Am]
Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia
and now Haiti needs us, the need us, they need us

[Chorus - All]
[Wyclef Jean]
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
[End]
