Snow falling gently to the ground
'Tis the night before
And in my heart there is no doubt
That this is gonna be
The brightest holiday
'Cause here you are with me
Baby, baby, I can't wait


To spend this special time of year with someone who
Makes me feel the special way that you do

Walkin' with you in a winter's now
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe
People smiling everywhere we go
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love

Ooh, you make the season bright
With the lights reflected in your eyes
All my dreams are comin' true tonight
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love

We'll stay up late tonight
Decorate the tree
Just look into my eyes
And I will tell you truthfully
That I don't need no Santa Claus
To hear my Christmas wish
I got you in my arms
And what could be a better gift

Than to spend my very favorite time of year
With the one I really love so near, Oh Yeeeaahhh.....

Walkin' with you in a winter's now
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe
People smiling everywhere we go
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love

Ooh, you make the season bright
With the lights reflected in your eyes
All my dreams are comin' true tonight
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love

And bells are ringing when I hear you say
We'll do it all again on Christmas Day
I can't wait

Walkin' with you in a winter's now
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe
People smiling everywhere we go
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love

Ooh, you make the season bright
With the lights reflected in your eyes
All my dreams are comin' true tonight
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love

Walkin' with you in a winter's now
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe
