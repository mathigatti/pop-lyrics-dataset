I know I never loved this way before
And no one else has loved me more
With you I've laughed and cried
I have loved and died
What I wouldn't do just to be with you 


I know I must forget you to go on
I can't hold back my tears too long
Though life won't be the same
I've got to take the blame
And find the strenght I need
To let you go 

Just walk away
Just say goodbye
Don't turn around now you may
See me cry
I mustn't fall apart
Or show my broken heart
Or the love I feel for you

So walk away
And close the door
And let my be as it was before
And I'll never never know
Just how I let you go
But there's notihng left to say
Just walk away 

There'll never be a moment I'll regret
I've loved you since the day we met
For all the love you gave
And all the love we made
I know I've got to find the
Strenght to say 

Just walk away
Just say goodbye
Don't turn around now you may
See me cry
I mustn't fall apart
Or show my broken heart
Or th love I feel for you 

So walk away
And close the door
And let my life be as it was before
And I'll never never know
Just how I let you go
But there's nothing left to say
Just walk away
