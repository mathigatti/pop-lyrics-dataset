Somewhere in this world
Someone shed a tear
Somebody just like you
Feels the way you do


Somewhere in this world
Someone understands
Another needs a helping hand
Help them if you can

I can touch you where you are
We both share every star
'cause a common thread runs through

Life means much the same to all
So let's tear down every wall
And build a bridge from me to you

When will we put fear aside?
Why can't we throw away false pride?
Every heart will glow when
Love lights up the world

No need to walk in the dark
We don't have to stand so far apart
Every heart will know when
Love lights up the world

Mothers everywhere
Babies at their breast
One love is like the rest
A universal bond
All around the world

Children laugh and play
Every boy and girl
The future of the world
As time continues on

I can touch you where you are
We both share every star
'cause a common thread runs through

Life means much the same to all
So let's tear down every wall
And build a bridge from me to you

When will we put fear aside?
Why can't we throw away false pride?
Every heart will glow when
Love lights up the world

No need to walk in the dark
We don't have to stand so far apart
Every heart will know when
Love lights up the world

When will we put fear aside?
Why can't we throw away false pride?
Every heart will glow when
Love lights up the world

Love is gonna light this whole world

No need to walk in the dark
We don't have to stand so far apart
Every heart will glow when
Love lights up the world

Love lights the world
Love lights the world
Let me hear it one more time

Love lights the world
And it shines on you
Love lights the world

Love lights the world let's sing it one more time
Love lights the world
Love lights up the world
And it shines on you

Love lights the world
Love lights up the world
Love lights the world
Love lights up the world
Love lights up the world
Love lights up the world
