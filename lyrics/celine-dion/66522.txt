There ain't a dream that don't have a chance 
To come true now 
It just takes a little faith baby 
Anything that we want to do 
We can do now 
There ain't nothing in our way baby 
Nothing our love couldn't rise above 
We can get through the night 
We can get to the light 
Long as we got our love to light the way 


With a little faith 
Just a little trust 
If you believe in love 
Love can move mountains 
Believe in your heart 
And feel, feel it in your soul 
And love baby love can love can move mountains 

Oceans deep and mountains high 
They can't stop us 
Because love is on our side baby 
We can reach the heavens and touch the sky 
Just believe it, believe in you and I baby 
If we got love that is strong enough 
We can do anything, make it through anything 
'Coz through it all love will always find a way 

With a little faith... 

You believe in me 
I'll believe in you 
If we believe in each other 
Nothing we can't do 
If we got love that is strong enough 
Love will find a way 

With a little faith
