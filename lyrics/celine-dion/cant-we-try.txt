I see your face cloud over like a little girl's
And your eyes have lost their shine
You whisper something softly I'm not meant to hear
Baby tell me what's on your mind


I don't care what people say
About the two of us from different worlds
I love you so much that it hurts inside
Are you listening
Please listen to me girl

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for
Can't we try just a little more passion
Can't we try just a little less pride
I love you so much baby
That it tears me up inside

I hear you on the telephone with god-knows-who
Spilling out your heart for free
Everyone needs someone they can talk to
Girl that someone should be me

So many times I tried to tell you
You just turned away
How did I know
My life is changing so fast now
Leaves me lonely and afraid
Don't be afraid no

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for
Can't we try just a little more passion
Can't we try just a little less pride
I love you so much baby
That it tears me up inside

Don't let our love fade away
Don't let our love fade away
No matter what people say
No matter no matter what they say
I need you more and more each day
Don't let our love fade away
Don't let our love fade away
No matter no matter what they say

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try just a little more passion
Can't we try just a little less pride
I love you so much baby
That it tears me up inside

Can't we try baby can't we give a little bit little bit
