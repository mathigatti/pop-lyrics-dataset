Thought I could define it
One look in your eyes went and proved me wrong.
I find myself speechless
This feeling of completeness is so strong
And I was convinced that my heart had reached its limit
Till you created this new place in it


Your touch wraps around me
In love that knows no boundaries
Now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
You're the answer I've been needing
Life has a whole new meaning
Now... All because of you

Everything is different,
There's no frame of reference for the way I feel
Oh to look at your face
I'm still amazed, I can't believe you're real
I can lie here forever just watching you sleep
Hanging on every breath that you breathe

Your touch wraps around me
In love that knows no boundaries
Now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
You're the answer I've been needing
Life has a whole new meaning
Now... All because of you

Your touch wraps around me
In love that knows no boundaries
Now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
You're the answer I've been needing
Life has a whole new meaning
Now... All because of you

All because of you...
Mmmmmm
