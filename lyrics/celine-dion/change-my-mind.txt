We were bold, we were dust, we were energy
We were more in the light than we'd ever be
Effortless dancing with symmetry
And the memories, more or less killing me 


All of my sirens running to your fire, don't fight it

Change my mind, make me drunk on you again
Turn back time, don’t you wonder where I’ve been 
Are you ever gonna change my mind? 
Change my mind
I’ve been waiting for you, change my mind 
Change my mind 

Chant my name, chant the words to my dying day
But I just seem to keep pushing you away 
And it’s all I can do as an optimist
To look out on the shore for our lonely ship 

All of my sirens running to your fire, can’t fight it

Change my mind, make me drunk on you again 
Turn back time, don’t you wonder where I’ve been 
Are you ever gonna change my mind? 
Change my mind
I’ve been waiting for you, change my mind 
Change my mind

Change my mind, make me drunk on you again 
Are you ever gonna, are you ever gonna, are you ever gonna
Change my mind, make me drunk on you again
Are you ever gonna, are you ever gonna

We were bold, we were dust, we were energy
We were more in the light than we’d ever be
