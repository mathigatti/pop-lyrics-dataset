If your shoes refuse to shine
And your legs they don't walk in line
And tomorrow is just some other time


(CHORUS)
That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman working on you

If your feet can't find the floor
And your key won't fit the door
And you've forgotten that two 2s are four

(CHORUS)
That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman working on you

And I've seen you wandering, baby, up and down my street
Trying to explain that love is made to all the people that
Searching for that imperious, mysterious femme fatale kind of stuff yeah
But if you don't know by now that it's me anyhow and then baby you've got it rough

So if you get so confused
And you're TV is blowing the fuse
Just come on over
You've got nothing to lose

(CHORUS)
That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman in me baby
That's just the woman working on you
Working on you, working on you, working on you

Cuz I need, I need a man to love
Because I need, I need a man to love, yeah
Respect me, protect me, roll over, drool over
Buy me a bunch of flowers and love

(CHORUS)
That's just the woman in me baby, yeah
Working on you, working on you, working on you
I need a man to love
I need a man to love
