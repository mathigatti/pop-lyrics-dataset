Mamma, you gave life to me
Turned a baby into a lady
And mamma all you had to offer
Was a promise of a lifetime of love
Now I know there is no other
Love like a mother's love for her child
And I now that love so complete someday must leave
Must say goodbye


Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye

Mamma, you gave love to me
Turned a young one into a woman
And mamma, all I ever needed
Was a guarantee of you loving me
'Cause I know there is no other love
Like a mother's love for her child
And it hurts so that something so strong
Someday will be gone, must say goodbye

Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye

But the love you give will always live
You'll always be there every time I fall
You offered me the greatest love of all
You take my weakness and you make me strong
And I will always love till forever comes

And when you need me
I'll be there for you always
I'll be there your whole life through
I'll be there this I promise you, mamma
I'll be your beacon through the darkest night
I'll be the wings that guide your broker flight
I'll be your shelter through the raging storm
And I will love you till forever comes

Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart you say goodbye
Till we meet again, until then, goodbye
