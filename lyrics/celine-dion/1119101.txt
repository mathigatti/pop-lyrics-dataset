I learned from the past not everything lasts
I understand that now everything changed when you walked away
But I survived some how
Though I have regrets
I learn to forget and just keep moving on
Cuz when love is gone you have to be strong


(CHORUS)
Once touched by pain, you're not the same
But time can heal your heart again
So let the clouds that bring you down
Just fade away, away

So I try to smile
But after a while the memories come back
But I won't give in
Cuz I know that then my heart will fade to black
This time I learned that love can burn
It's an old consuming flame

There's no right or wrong
I've got to be strong

(CHORUS)
Once touched by pain, you're not the same
But time can heal your heart again
So let the clouds that bring you down
Just fade away, away

I know that one day I'll find it, feel it again
But until I do I'll do it
Find by myself

(CHORUS)
Once touched by pain, you're not the same
But time can heal your heart again
So let the clouds that bring you down
Just fade away

Once touched by pain, you're not the same
But time can heal your heart again
So let the clouds that bring you down
So let the clouds that bring you down
Just fade away, away
