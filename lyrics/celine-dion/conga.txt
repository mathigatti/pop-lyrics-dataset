[Celine Dion]
Everybody gather 'round now
Let your body feel the heat
Don't you worry if you can't dance
Let the music move your feet


[Gloria Estefan]
It's the rhythm of the island
And like the sugar cane so sweet
If you want to do the conga
You've got to listen to the beat

[Both]
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat

[Gloria Estefan]
Feel the fire of desire
As you dance the night away
'Cause tonight we're gonna party
'Til we see the break of day

[Celine Dion]
Better get yourself together
And hold on to what you've got
Once the music hits your system
There's no way you're gonna stop

[Both]
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Shake your body baby
Shake your body baby
