There's a tree
Standing there
In such an ordinary way
But as i look around
Everything keeps changing
There's a leaf
On that tree
And it floats into a stream
And like everything
It gets carried away
To the sea


But if we give a little of our love away
Maybe meet in the middle
Every night and day
If we could hear just a whisper
Of what the heart needs to say
It could sure make a difference
In some small
In some small way
In your heart lies the key
That unlocks your destiny
Look within and we'll find
Everything we're longing for

Oh
May you cherish each moment you live
And know all the love that you give
Will go on and on and on

There's a sky vast and blue
And it lies deep inside of you
Breathe it in
Let it out

But if we give a little of our love away
Maybe meet in the middle
Every night and day
If we could hear just a whisper
Of what the heart needs to say
It could sure make a difference
In some small
In some small way
In your heart lies the key
That unlocks your destiny
Look within and we'll find
Everything we're longing for
Breathe it in again
