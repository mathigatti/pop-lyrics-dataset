God bless america
Land that i love
Stand beside her
And guide her
Through the night
With the light
From above
From the mountains
To the prairies
To the oceans
White with foam
God bless america
My home sweet home


Repeat

From the mountains
To the prairies
To the oceans
White with foam
God bless america
My home sweet home
God bless america
My home sweet home
God bless america
God bless america
My home sweet home
