At the doorway of my heart
All the leaves have fallen down
And though I try to pick them up
There's so many I think I`ll drown


Ten days have come and gone
Ten days and I'm all alone
And all that I can do is pray and pray
Ten days I've seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day
But all I've got to do is
Pray and pray
And pray

At the doorway of my life
I feel the pain but feel no shame
And what I've got I keep inside
Some things have changed but I'm still the same

Ten days have come and gone
Ten days and I'm all alone
And all that I can do is pray and pray
Ten days I've seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day
But all I've got to do is
Pray and pray
And pray

And if you're going my way
Don't think that I'll bend
'Cause this is where I'll stay
I think it's the end

Ten days have come and gone
Ten days and I'm all alone
And all that I can do is
Pray and pray
Ten days I've seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day
But all I've got to do is
Pray and pray and pray

Ten days, ten days, ten days, ten days
