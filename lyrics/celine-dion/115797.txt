Got your invitation to the dance
Wear your party dress
Maybe I was just an innocent
But I confess


I never even knew the song
The orchestra was playing

See the cuties in their party clothes
Oh, it's getting warm
Off the shoulder cut into the hip
Like a uniform

Did you think I'd want to tow the line?
Well now the line is broken

Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance

You said you're such a pretty thing
You could make a mark
I'll teach though all the steps you'll need
Guide you through the dark

Suddenly I thought I knew the song
The orchestra was playing

Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance

Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance

See how they follow
You say jump, they jump
You say turn, they turn
Look back in sorrow
I won't be there
I won't be there
