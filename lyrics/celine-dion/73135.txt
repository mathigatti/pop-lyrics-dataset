Yesterday 

I said sit back relax it's not the end
We're gonna postpone it put it off again
Our separate paths will lead us different ways
But the care remains
It will always stay


CHORUS:
Yesterday's not all that bad
Sorry I could not make this last
Yesterday's not all we have
Sorry I could not make this last

One thing I need from you that's honesty
Please never lie to me
Is what she said to me

One thing for sure
Is that I will be true in everything I do
That's what I learned from you

Being on the road is tough on everyone
Because you're here then gone
It takes so long (4X)

CHORUS
