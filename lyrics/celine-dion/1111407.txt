White chocolate kisses
Under the stars
Riding on horses
Boys with guitars
If you really wanna get through to me
You don't have to try so hard


Give me a reason to dance in the dark
Be there to catch me and I'll fall apart
If you wanna know how to get to me
Follow the map to my heart

I cry for no reason
I lie at awkward moments
There's no manual
That explains where I'm going
So show me the way
Show me the way

White chocolate kisses
Under the stars
Riding on horses
Boys with guitars
If you wanna know how to get to me
Follow the map to my heart

You play that thing
Like you're talking to God
You strum those strings like an angel on earth
Did you know this?
I can't focus on nothing else
What's making me come out of my shell
Sometimes it's so hard to tell
I don't even know myself
But you do
Yeah, you do

Don't ask for directions
I'm tired of explaining
There's no book I've read
That says what I'm saying
So show me the way
Show me the way

Give me a reason to dance in the dark
Be there to catch me and I'll fall apart
If you really wanna get through to me
You don't have to try so hard
And if you wanna know how to get to me
Then follow the map to my heart
Just follow, baby, to my heart
To my heart
