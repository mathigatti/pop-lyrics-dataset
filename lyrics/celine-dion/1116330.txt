My love we have seen it all
The endless confession
The rise and fall
As fragile as a child
But lately I'm sorry I can't hold a smile


(CHORUS)
But I stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
Did you know I take the time for you
Did you know that I would see you through
Did you know that I would play the part
I must have made it clear right from the start

My love can you give me strength
Somehow I forgot how to ease my pain
I know IÃ‚'m right where I belong
Something from nothing never proved me wrong

(CHORUS)
But I stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
But did you know I take the time for you
Did you know that I would see you through
Did you know that I would play the part
I must have made it clear right from the start

I would share my whole life with you
Would you do the same for me
I would give all I am to you
Would you do the same for me

(CHORUS)
And I will stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
Could you see I could break
Did you notice all my mistakes
There were times I could feel you read my mind

But did you know I take the time for you
Did you know that I could see right through
Did you know that I would play the part
I know I made it clear right from the start
