Have you ever been in love
You could touch the moonlight
When you heart is shooting stars
You're holdin heaven in your arms
Have you ever been so in love


Have you ever walked on air
Ever felt like you were dreaming
When you never thought it could
But it will, it feels that good
Have you ever been so in love

Have you ever been in love
You could touch the moonlight
When your heart is shooting stars
You're holding heaven in your arms
Have you ever been in love, have you

The time I spent Waiting
For something that was heaven sent
When you find it don't let go
I know

Have you ever said a prayer
And found that it was answered
All my hopes have been restored
And I ain't looking anymore
Have you ever been so in love, have you

Some place that you ain't leaving
Somewhere you're gonna stay
When you finally found that meaning
Have you ever felt this way

The time I spent waiting
For something that was heaven sent
When you find it, don't let go
I know

Coz have you ever been so in love, so in love
You could touch the moonlight
You can even reach the stars
Doesn't matter near or far
Have you ever been so in love

Cause have you ever  been in love
Have you ever been in love
So, in love
