High above the mountains
Far across the sea
I can hear your voice
Callin' out to me


Brighter than the sun
And darker than the night
I can see your love
Shinin' like a light

And on and on this earth spins like a carrousel
If i could travel across the world
The secrets i would tell

You and i were meant to fly
Higher than the clouds
We'll sail across the sky
So come with me
And you will feel
That we're soaring
That we're floating up so high
'cause you and i were meant to fly

Sailng like a bird
High on the wings of love
Take me higher than
All the stars above

I'm burnin',yearnin',gently turnin' round and round
I'm always rising up
I never want to come back down

You and i were meant to fly
Higher than the clouds
We'll sail across the sky
So come with me
And you will feel
That we're soaring
That we're floating up so high
'cause you and i were meant to fly

Fly, i i i, fly, i i i

You and i were meant to fly
Higher than the clouds
We'll sail across the sky
So come with me
And you will feel
Thatyou and i were meant to fly
You and i were meant to fly
