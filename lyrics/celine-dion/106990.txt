A million stars light
This beautiful night
This is not a night to die
Let me sing and dance
Beneath the sky
I have such love to give
To give!
I want a chance to live


Live
For the one I love
Love
As no one has loved
Give
Asking nothing in return

Free
Free to find my way
Free to have my say
Free to see the day

Be
Like I used to be
Like a wild bird free
With all of life in me

Live
For the one I love
Love
As no one has loved
Give
Asking nothing in return

Though this world tears us apart
We're still together in my heart
I want the world to hear my cry
And even if I have to die
Love will not die
Love will change the world

Live
For the one I love
Love
As no one has loved
Give
Asking nothing in return

I'll love until love wears me away
I'll die and I know my love will stay
And I know my love will stay
