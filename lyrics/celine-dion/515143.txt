Hello, it's celine here,
I'd like to take this opportunity
To wish you all a merry christmas
And i hope you have something special
Planned for this holiday season


Well i'm going to be with my family, of course.
With my thirteen bothers and sisters
And with my thirty... i can't even count them anymore,
There's thirtysomething nieces and nephews.
We're going to share some gifts together.
We're going to have some great times,
Some great food, some great music,
We're going to have a great time.

So i hope you too will (be) spending time with your friends
And family, and loved ones, of course.

Once again, have a great time at christmas
And all the best for the new year.

Bye for now, take care, bye bye
