Just a little bit of love
I was alone, I was afraid
I couldn't face another day of pain in my life oh oh oh
I called your name and you were there
Just like an answer to a prayer
You made it all right, oh, yeah


So I give my heart
And I give my soul to you, oh, I do
And now I know
I know I found the truth, oh, hey

Just a little bit of love's gonna turn it around
A little bit of love can do it
And just a little bit of love's gonna turn it
Around, and around, and around, oh, yeah

I found the truth I found the way
I'm standing in the light of day
I got the power
I'm not worried any longer
No I'm only getting stronger by the hour

You can move a mountain
Or calm the stormy sea
There's no doubt about it
I truly do believe

Just a little bit of love's gonna turn it around
A little bit of love can do it
And just a little bit love's gonna turn it
Around, around, and around, oh, yeah

Just a little bit of love's gonna turn it around
A little bit of love can do it
And just a little bit of love's gonna turn it
Around, and around, and around, oh, yeah

And it can free your mind
Yes it can free your soul
Yes it can free your mind
And it can free your soul

Free your soul let it go let it go
Just a little bit of love just a little bit of love
Yeah

Just a little bit of love's gonna turn it around
A little bit of love can do it
And just a little bit of love's gonna turn it
Around, and around, and around, oh, yeah

Just a little bit of love's gonna turn it around
A little bit of love can do it
And just a little bit of love's gonna turn it
Around, and around, and around, oh, yeah
