I've looked everywhere I can
Just to find a clue
Oh to get to you
And make you want me
And I've run circles 'round the sun
Chasin' after you
Oh but it's no use
Can't you see that I'm going out of my mind
Trying to find a way to get through to you
Oh you don't know how hard I try
And I try and I try
What do I gotta do


Do I gotta get water from the moon
Is that what do I gotta do
To make you love me
Make you love me
Do I gotta turn the sand into the sea
Is that what you want from me
I've done everything that I can do
But get water from the moon

I've reached high up in the sky
Tryin' to steal the stars
Oh to win your heart
But even that's not enough
And I've searched every book I know
Just to find the words
Oh to touch your world and get some love out of you
I've already given all I can give
And I don't I don't know what's left to try
And I try and I try
What do I gotta do

Do I gotta get water from the moon
Is that what do I gotta do
To make you love me
Make you love me
Do I gotta turn the sand into the sea
Is that what you want from me
I've done everything that I can do
But get water from the moon

Love me, how do I make you love me
How do I make you see that I'm goin'
Out of my mind

I try, and I try, and I try...

Do I gotta get water from the moon
Baby is that what do I gotta do
To make you love me
Make you love me
Do I gotta turn the sand into the sea
Is that what you want from me
I've done everything that I can do
But get water from the
Water from the moon
