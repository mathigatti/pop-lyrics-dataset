Can you keep a secret?

These walls keep a secret
That only we know
But how long can they keep it
Cause we're two lovers who lose control
We're two shadows chasing rainbows
Behind closed windows
Behind closed doors


If walls could talk
They would say: I want you more
They would say: Hey, never felt like this before
And that you would always be
The one for me

Two people making memories
Just too good to tell
And these arms are never empty
When we're lying where we fell
We're paiting pictures, making magic, taking chances
Making love

If the walls had eyes my
They would see the love inside
They would see me
In your arms in ecstasy
And with every move they'd know
I love you so

When I'm feeling weak
You give me wings
When the fire has no heat
You light it up again
When I hear no violins
You play my every string

So stop the press
Hold the news
The secret's safe between me and you
Walls, can you keep a secret?

If walls could talk
They would say: I want you more
They would say: Hey, never felt like this before
And that you would always be
The one for me
If the walls had eyes my
They would see the love inside
They would see me
In your arms in ecstasy
And with every move they'd know
I love you so
