I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
and I think to myself, what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
the bright blessed day, dark sacred night
and I think to myself, what a wonderful world
the colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying "how do you do?"
they're really saying "I love you"
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
they'll learn much more than I'll ever know
and I think to myself, what a wonderful world
yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
and I think to myself, what a wonderful world
