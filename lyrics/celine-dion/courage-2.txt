I would be lying if I said: I'm fine
I think of you at least a hundred times
'Cause in the echo of my voice I hear your words
Just like you're there
I still come home from a long day
So much to talk about, so much to say
I love to think that we're still making plans


In conversations that'll never end
In conversations that'll never end

Courage, don't you dare fail me now
I need you to keep away the doubts
I'm staring in the face of something new
You're all I got to hold on to
So, courage, don't you dare fail me now

Not one to hide from the truth, I know
It's outta my hands but, I won't let you go
There's no replacing the way you touched me
I still feel the rush
Sometimes it drowns me 'til I can't breathe
Thinking it's only in our memories
But, then I talk to you like I did then

In conversations that will never end

Courage, don't you dare fail me now
I need you to keep away the doubts
I'm staring in the face of something new
You're all I got to hold on to
So, courage, don't you dare fail me now

'Cause it's not easy when you're not with me
The world of madness goes faster now
And it's a train wreck, but I won't crash, yet
Long as your echo never fades out

Courage, don't you dare fail me now
Cause it's not easy when you're not with me
The world of madness goes faster now
And it's a train wreck, but I won't crash, yet
Long as your echo never fades out
Courage, don't you dare fail me now
