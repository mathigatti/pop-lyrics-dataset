[Josh Groban]
Don't look away
An innocent face
Cries, and searches for some comfort


[Yolanda Adams]
Love will provide
What fate has denied
All they ask is simply someone

[Josh Groban]
With arms that reach (with arm that reach)
And words that teach (and word that teach)
We'll be their strength (yeah yeah)
In times of need

[Children]
Every boy and girl
Should dance on dreams
Around this world
Aren't they all our children after all
Who will dry their tears
And lift them up
If they should fall
Aren't they all our children after all

[Nick Carter]
Oh, so who will be there
To show them loving care
They are this world's living treasure
The heart of a child
Is born to wear a smile
And feel joyful without measure

[Enrique Iglesias]
With arms that reach (with arms that reach)
And words that teach (word that teach)
We'll be their strength (will be their strength)
In times of need

[Celine]
We'll hold their hearts
In loving hands
Help them believe
In love again

[All]
Every boy and girl
Should dance on dreams
Around this world
Aren't they all our children after all
Aren't they all our children after all
(Aren't we all your children after all)

[Josh Groban]
And as they grow
They will always know
That love will ease their troubled road (troubled road)

[Celine]
And you and I
Are their wings
To help them fly

[All]
Every boy and girl
Should dance on dreams
Around this world
Aren't they all our children after all (every boy and girl)
Every boy and girl
Should dance on dreams
Around this world
Aren't they all our children after all
Aren't they all our children after all
Aren't we all your children after all

Aren't they all our children after all
