Oh, I tell you once and I tell you twice
I'll be there for you in your paradise
Oh, please stay with me and I show you what I feel
You're the nearest thing to heaven girl
Baby just for you, fly around he world
Oh, everything I do, I do it just for you


My sexy, sexy lover, oh tell me there's no other
Tell me there's no other deep in your heart
My sexy, sexy lover, I wanna be your cover
There's no other, who's breaking apart
Oh my sexy little lover, swear there is no other
I'll feel alone when I'm coming home
Oh, my sexy little lover, tell me there's no other
Just when I'm down, need you all around

I'm not a man who wants to be alone
There's a place for us - we can't go wrong
Oh baby, you and I, we're flying one mile high 
We are more that two, you are more than one
And my love for you is burning like the sun
Oh, everything I do, I do it just for you
