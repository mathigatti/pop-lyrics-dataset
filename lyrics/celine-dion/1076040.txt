Don't know much about your life
Don't know much about your world but
Don't want to be alone tonight
On this planet they call Earth


You don't know about my past
And I don't have a future figured out
And maybe this is going too fast
And maybe it's not meant to last

But what do you say to taking chances?
What do you say to jumping off the edge?
Never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay
What do you say?
What do you say?

I just want to start again
Maybe you can show me how to try
Maybe you could take me in
Somewhere underneath your skin

What do you say to taking chances?
What do you say to jumping off the edge?
Never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay
What do you say?
What do you say?

And I had my heart beaten down
But I always come back for more, yeah
There's nothing but love to pull you up
When you're lying down on the floor, yeah
So talk to me, talk to me
Like lovers do
Yeah walk with me, walk with me
Like lovers do
Like lovers do

What do you say to taking chances?
What do you say to jumping off the edge?
And never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay
What do you say?
What do you say?

Don't know much about your life
And I don't know much about your world
