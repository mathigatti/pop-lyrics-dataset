Forgive me
Don't know where to start
I guess we've come to
The serious part
I need to find out
If there's a chance
For us...
Don't give me that same old look
It won't win me over
Don't give me that same old speech
You don't have to speak at all
You can say you love me
That I'm your perfect crush
How it hurts to need someone that much
You can swear you mean it
But that ain't good enough
Cuz when a man loves a woman it is all
In his touch
I wish you could see (yeah)
Just how simple
It's supposed to be
'Cause now that we've come this far
We don't want to lose it
If you wanna win my heart
Baby just shut your mouth
You can say you love me
That I'm your perfect crush
How it hurts to need someone that much
You can swear you mean it
But that ain't good enough
Cuz when a man loves a woman it is all
In his touch
Then words don't mean that much
