It's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside
And who is the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight


And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion
Taking me over
Caught up in sorrow
Lost in the soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me darling
Don't you know there's
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Don't you know there's
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Kiss goodnight
Goodnight goodnight

I'm there at your side
I'm part of all the things you are
But you got a part of someone else
You go to find your shining star

And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion
That's taking me over
Taking me over
Caught up in sorrow
Lost in the soul
But if you don't come back
Yeah yeah yeah
Come home come home come home
Don't you know that there'll be
Nobody to hold me
Nobody to kiss me
Goodnight

And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you you go
I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion emotion yeah
I'm caught up in sorrow
Lost in my soul
Don't you know the nights without you baby
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
Nobody left in this world
To hold me tight
Nobody, nobody to hold me
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Nobody to kiss me goodnight
Goodnight goodnight
