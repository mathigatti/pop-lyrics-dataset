Ave Maria!
Maiden mild!
Oh, listen to a maiden's prayer
for thou can't hear amid the wild
this thou, this thou can't save amid, despair
we slumbers safely tear the Mother
though we be man outcast relieved
Oh maiden, hear a maidens sorrow
Oh mother, hear a suppliant child
Ave Maria


Ave Maria, gracia plena
Maria, gracia plena
Maria, gracia plena
Ave, ave dominus
dominus tecum

The murky cavern's air so heavy
Shall breath of balm if thou hast smiled
Oh Maiden, hear a maiden's pleadin
Oh Mother, hear a suppliant child
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
