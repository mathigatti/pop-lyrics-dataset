I thought I knew you
Thought that I knew you well
We had a rhythm
But I guess you never can tell


Oh, I learned early
Never to ignore the signs
You'll be forgiven
It ain't worth that much in my mind

Lovin you (was) so easy
It's hard to say goodbye
But if that's the way it goes, it goes

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You been seriously misled

Lovin' somebody
Ain't your average 9 To 5
It takes conviction
It takes a will to survive

I'm not somebody who commits
The crime and leaves the scence
But when I've been dissed
I don't spend much time
On what might've been

I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
So I'm movin', movin' on

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You been seriously misled

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
You are seriously misled

I get on with my mind
And you're not on my mind
I'm not too close to time
To get over you

I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
So I'm movin', movin' on

(Just a page of my history)
(Just another one of those mysteries)
Just another page
(One more lover that used to be)
If you think you're in my head
You been seriously misled

(Just a page of my history)
Whooa, whooa, yeah
(Just another one of those mysteries)
(One more lover that used to be)
If you're thinking, baby, thinking, baby
Thinking, baby, oh yeah!

(Just a page of my history)
Ooh, yeah!
(Just another one of those mysteries)
(One more lover that used to be)
If you think you're in my head
You been seriously misled
