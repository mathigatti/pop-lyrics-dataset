I was walking dead, stuck inside my head
I couldn't get out, turn the lights down
The voices inside were so loud


Need a jump-start, catatonia, I couldn't feel
I wish that I could disappear
The voices inside were so real

But you stood by my side
Night after night, night after night

You loved me back to life, life
From the coma, the wait is over
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight
Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life, yeah

You woke me up, one touch, and I felt alive
Loved me back to life, back to life, thought I'd die
The voices inside were so quiet

But you stood by my side
Night after night, night after night

You loved me back to life, life
From the coma, the wait is over
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight

Strong hand, thick skin, and an open heart
You saw through the pain, saw through the mask
You never gave up on me

Life, life
From the coma, the wait is over
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight
Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life
Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life, yeah
