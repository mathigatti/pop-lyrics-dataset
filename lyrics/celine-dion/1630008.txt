Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain, chain of fools
Five long years I thought I was your man
But I found out I'm just a link in your chain


Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain, chain of fools

You told me to leave you alone
My father said come on home
My doctor said take it easy
Whole bunch of lovin is much too strong

Chain, chain, chain, chain,
Chain, chain of fools
