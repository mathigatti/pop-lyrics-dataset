One heart you are following

You can run
And you can begin
In a place
Where you don't fit in
'Cause love will find a way


When you're down
You can start again
Turn around
Anything you're in
Love will find a place
If you got...

One heart you are following
One dream that keeps you wandering
Love lights your way through the night

One wish that keeps you trying
What's your silver lining
Love lights your way through the night

You can fall a thousand time
You can feel like you've lost your mind
But love will find a way

And a minute
Can change your life
And a moment can make it right
Love will find a place

Everybody needs something to hold onto

If you got

One heart you are following
One dream that keeps you wandering
Love lights your way through the night

One wish that keeps you trying
What's your silver lining
Love lights your way through the night

Is it your own
Is it your own
