Waited for the right one to find me; 
Wondered when the right one would come. 
Would I - would I see in that instant I see him? 
And my - and my heart's found that one? 


Chorus: 
Would I know, 
If he was right here beside? 
Would I see, 
If he was in front of me? 
Would I feel, 
Something inside that would let me know 
That it's right, that it's real? 
Would I see? 
Would I know. 

Waited for the right eyes to see me; 
Was reaching for the right arms to hold. 
Would I - would I know I was just getting further? 
Would I know when I'm getting close? 

Chorus: 
Would I know, 
If he was standing beside? 
Would I see, 
That he was the one for me? 
Would I feel, 
Something inside that would let me know 
That it's right, that it's real? 
Would I see? 
Could I trust what I feel? 
Would I know? 

Bridge: 
Would I see is the one that I search for? 
Would I feel from that feeling inside? 
Would I know from inside of my soul? 
Would I know... know. 

Something inside me that lets me know 
That it's right, that it's real. 
I can see; now I know. 
Ooooooooooooooooo. 

Something inside me that lets me know 
That it's right, that it's real. 
I can see; I can trust what I feel. 
Now I know. 
Waited for the right one to find me...
