Lookin' out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face
another day
Oh it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind


'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to clain it
And didn't know just what was wrong
with me
Oh till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm livin' for
'Cause if you make me happy
I don't need to do more
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

Oh baby what you've done to me
You make me feel so good inside
And I, I just wanna be close to you
Because you make me feel so alive
Oh what you've done to me
Close to you because you make me feel
so alive
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman
Woman

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman
You make me feel
Oh baby what you do to me
Can make me feel so good inside
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
Oh what you've done
Natural woman
