I've been over you for some time
now baby
I don't miss your kiss like before
now anymore
If you ask me how I'm doin' I'm fine
All I needed was a little time
So if you think that I still need you baby
I really don't know why


Oh baby since you left me
You might think that my world's
been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that
Nothing's broken, nothing broken
but my heart

You won't find no tears in my eyes
now baby
If you think I'm sad that you're
gone now
Then you're wrong now
If you ask I'll say that I'm happy
I'm free
Tell you that's the way i wanna be
And all those nights we shared
together baby
Well they don't mean a thing

Oh baby since you left me
You might think that my world's
been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that
Nothing's bronken, nothing broken
but my heart

Oh baby, you might think my world's
been torn apart
Oh but you'll see that
Nothing's broken, nothing broken
but my heart

So if you think that I still need you baby
I don't think about you
I'm happy now without you

Oh baby since you left me
You might think that my world's
been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that
Nothing's broken, nothing broken
but my heart
Nothing broken, nothing broken
but my heart

Baby, you might think my world's
been torn apart
But nothing's broken, nothing broken
but my heart. . .
