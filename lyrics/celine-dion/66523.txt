There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window


There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this and you hold me like that
I just have to admit that it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this and I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow

Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this and if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago but it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this and if you need me like that
It was dead long ago, but it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist and it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this and if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago, but it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this and if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind, but it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow

Baby, baby, baby

When you touch me like this and when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind, but it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this and when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies all coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me now

(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when I touch you like that
(It's all coming back to me now)
And if you do it like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And if we
