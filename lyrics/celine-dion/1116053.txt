I've seen the tears and the heartache and I felt the pain
I've seen the hatred in so many lives lost in vain
And yet through this darkness there's always a light that shines through
That takes me back home, takes me back home


All of the promises broken
And all of the songs left unsung
Seems so far away as I make my way back to you
You gave me faith

And you gave me a world to believe in
You gave me a love to believe in
And feeling this love I can rise up above
And be strong and be whole once again

I know that dreams we hold on to can just fade away
And I know that words can be wasted with so much to say
And when I feel helpless there's always a hope that shines through
And makes me believe, makes me believe

And I see for one fleeting moment
Paradise under the sun
I drift away and I make my way back to you
You gave me faith

And you gave me a world to believe in
You gave me a love to believe in
And feeling this love I can rise up above
And be strong and be whole once again

Life goes on and leave us with so more in pain
And I hold on to all that you are, to all that we'll be
And I can go on once again

You gave me a world to believe in
You gave me a love to believe in
And feeling this love I can rise up above
And be strong and be whole once again

Cuz your love is my soul once again
I can live, I can dream once again
Cuz you made me believe
