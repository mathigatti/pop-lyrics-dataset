Don't you know that you're my reason
For my love, my life, my being
So secure and so so sure my
Heart would surely die without you


I tried to swallow my pride
But I felt my heart start to tremble inside
Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go
Tell me

Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt the trust starting to die
Why oh why
When I still love you, it's so hard to say goodbye

How can you tell me it was nothing
Cause you took away everything I dreamed in
Just a night and I held you so tight
When you know you were sleeping in my bed

I tried to swallow my pride
But I felt my heart start to tremble inside
Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go
Tell me

Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt my heart starting to cry
Why oh why
When I saw you, with other girl

Why
Why when I looked in yours eyes
I felt my trust starting to die
Why oh why
When I still love you, it's so hard to say goodbye

[Solo:]

Should I quietly leave through the door
Or maybe pretend the way things were once before
When I met you
I'll never forget you, so

Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt the trust starting to die
Why oh why
When I still love you, it's so hard to say goodbye

Ooh why
Why did you have to lie
Cause I felt the trust starting to die
Why o why
When I still love you
It's so hard to say goodbye
