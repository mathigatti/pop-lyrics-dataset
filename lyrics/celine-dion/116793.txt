I've tried my best for so long
To break down these walls
But you build them strong
So I stand here waiting, wondering why
Oh why


Why don't you dive a little bit
Break down give a little bit

Show, show some emotion
Open, open your heart, ooh
Set free an ocean
Only a feeling can save us now

You say you've been hurt
Well you're not alone
As you race through this life what you
keep to yourself
Can turn you to stone
All it would take is one kind word
To be heard

Come on and give a little bit
Try to forgive a little bit

Show, show some emotion
Open, open your heart
Set free an ocean
Only a feeling can save us now

(Solo)

Show, show some emotion
Open, open your heart
Set free an ocean
Only a feeling can save us now

Show, show some emotion
Open, open your heart
Set free an ocean
Only a feeling can save us now
