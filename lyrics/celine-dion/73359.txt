So this is who I am
And this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow


And I will stand for my dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
But you are my only
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead
I won't let my heart control my head
But you are my only
We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be

Immortality
I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me inside

Fulfill your destiny
Is there within the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
The king of hearts, joker's wild

We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
I'll make them all remember me

Cos I have found a dream that must come true
Every ounce of me must see it though
But you are my only
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me

Immortality
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me, inside
We don't say goodbye

With all my love for you
And what else we may do
We don't say goodbye
