So suddenly so strange
Life wakes you up
Things change
I've done my best
I've served my call
I thought I had it all


So suddenly so strong
My prejudice
Was gone
You needed me
I found my place
I'm different now
These days

CHORUS I:
Now the greatest reward
Is the light in your eyes
The sound of your voice
And the touch of your hand
You made me who I am

You trusted me to grow
I gave my heart
To show
There's nothing else
I cherish more
I stand by you
For sure

CHORUS II:
Now the greatest reward
Is the love that I can give
I'm here for you now
For as long as I live
You made me who I am

So suddenly it's clear to me
Things change
Our future lies here and now
We made it through somehow

CHORUS II:
Now the greatest reward
Is the love that I can give
I'm here for you now
For as long as I live
You made me who I am
