She can feel you
Drifting far away
But she can't see through
What you do not say
Take a step back
Don't lose your ground
Remenber how you felt before
And if you care about her
Show her that you're sure


If I where you
My prized possessions
Would be the ones I'd hold so close
'Cause when you lose your love
You lose what means the most
If I where you
I'd hold affection
Higher than any star in sight
Take this to heart
And you'll never part
These are the things that I would do
If I where you

Simple pleasures
The hardest to be found 
Can't be measured
'Til they're not around
Maybe she'll go
Maybe she'll stay
But she'd rather go than fade away
Sometimes the sweetest sorrow
Is the saddest fate

(Chorus)
Take a step back
Don't lose your ground
Remenber how you felt before
And if you care about her 
Show her that you're sure

If I where you
I'd hold affection
Higher than any star in sight
Take this to heart
And you'll never part
These are the things that I would do
If I where you
Take this to heart
You'll never part
These are things that I would do
If I where you
