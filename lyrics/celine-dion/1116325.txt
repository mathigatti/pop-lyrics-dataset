It's so sad what we have become
Beautiful days we seem to leave so undone
And I don't know where we'll go from here
All I know is that I can't see, see the sun through the sky from here


Everyone has a finger that they can't point me to the light
It can't be that hard to find
After all we're so bright

I don't know if tomorrow has a day
I don't know if the rays would shine my way, yeah
All I know is that I'm standing in a place where
My future is like the skies of L.A.
Skies of L.A.
Skies of L.A.

I don't know if my body can take much more
Hey, we're in the land of the richest riches
But my mind seems so poor

Everyone has a finger but they can't point me to the light
It shouldn't be that hard to find
After all we're so bright

I see so many visions, but everyone seems out of sight
This total neglection
Skies of L.A.
My future is like the skies of L.A.
