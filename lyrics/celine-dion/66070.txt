Laugh and cry, live and die
Life is a dream we are dreaming
Day by day I find my way
Look for the soul and the meaning


CHORUS:
Then you look at me
And I always see
What I have been searching for
I'm lost as can be
Then you look at me
And I am not lost anymore

People run, sun to sun
Caught in their lives ever flowing
Once begun, life goes till it's gone
We have to go where it's going

CHORUS:

And you say you see
When you look at me
The reason you love life so
Though lost I have been
I'll find love again
And life just keeps on running
And life just keeps on running
You look at me and life comes from you
