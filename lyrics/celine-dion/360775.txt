Your Light - Celine Dion 

Hey man, come over here
There's a secret that I wanna whisper in your ear
I've waited so long, too long
But I can't deny it anymore it's just too strong


It's a special kind of feelin'
Something to believe in, Oh yeah

So lay back, and let it flow
Then just open up your heart and let your feelings go
I said "Hey man, Yo man"
Well it's really not that difficult to understand

That it's me that you've been seein'
Baby when you're dreamin', at night

So let your walls come down
And you'll feel my emotion
I will shelter you
From a tear or an ocean

Whenever your hope is gone
I'll give you strength to carry on
In the darkness of the night
I will be your light
I'll give you something to hold on to
When you can't find your way
Like a fire burning bright
I will be your light

So relax, we'll take it slow
I wouldn't think you'd really have a better place to go
I said "Hey man, Yo Man"
Why don't you move a little closer here and take my hand

Are you feelin' what I'm feelin'
I know I must be dreamin', oh yeah

But sometimes life can come
To build a wall in between us
Don't let it get you down
Whoever said love was an easy thing

Whenever your hope is gone
I'll give you strength to carry on
In the darkness of the night
I will be your light
I'll give you something to hold on to
When you can't find your way
Like a fire burning bright
I will be your light

I will be your light
Whenever you need a friend
Just come over to me baby
Baby Baby Baby
So let your walls come down
And you'll feel my emotion
I will shelter you
From a tear or an ocean

Whenever your hope is gone
I'll give your strength to carry on
In the darkness of the night
I will be your light
I'll give you something to hold on to
When you can't find your way
Like a fire burning bright
I will be your light

Whenever your hope is gone
I'll give your strength to carry on
In the darkness of the night
I will be your light
Light, shining bright, baby
I'll be the one who holds you, baby
I'll be the one who loves you, baby
Be the one who holds you, loves you,
Baby, baby
