Think about your lips and the way the kiss
There’s so much I really miss about you
Sitting on the beach you were still in reach
And I haven’t felt free without you


All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were my love was tragic
And you’re the last thing that I need

So I laid a dozen roses for the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices even though I paid the cost
Oh all those nights the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I laid a dozen roses
I laid them there, I laid them there for you

You’ve been on my mind every single night
I can’t visualize life without you
I’ve been tryna go a week without losing sleep
But there’s something that I need to go through

All the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were my love was tragic
And you’re the last thing that I need

So I laid a dozen roses for the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices even though I paid the cost
Oh all those nights the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I laid a dozen roses
I laid them there, I laid them there for you

I laid them there for you

So I laid a dozen roses for the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices even though I paid the cost
Oh all those nights the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I laid a dozen roses
I laid them there, I laid them there for you
