Forgive me for the things that I never said to you
Forgive me for not knowing, the right words to say to prove
That I will always be devoted to you and me
And if you can't feel that in my love
Then I'm sorry for not giving you enough


But I'm not sorry for my love
I'm not sorry for my touch
The way I made your hands tremble and my heart rush
I would do it all again
Wouldn't take back a thing
'Cause with you I've lived a thousand lives in one
And I could never be
I could never be
Sorry for love

Maybe there have been times that I let you down
Looking back on all those moments I know that I should have found
The best of me for you
And now I will promise to
And if you don't see that in my eyes
Then I'll be sorry for the rest of my life

But I'm not sorry for my love
I'm not sorry for my touch
The way I made your hands tremble and my heart rush
I would do it all again
Wouldn't take back a thing
'Cause with you I've lived a thousand lives in one
And I could never be
I could never be
Sorry for love

We all make mistakes
No matter how hard we try
But hearts can only break
When sorry comes around
And we don't forgive each other somehow

But I'm not sorry for my love
I'm not sorry for my touch
The way I made your hands tremble and my heart rush
I would do it all again
Wouldn't take back a thing
'Cause with you I've lived a thousand lives in one
And I could never be
I could never be
Sorry for love
