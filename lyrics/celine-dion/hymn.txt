Infinity, where does it start?
Where do we go when we depart?
The ice is thin; you're standing still
When you advance, it falls apart


Open your eyes, look straight ahead
A morning sky hangs by a thread
You hear your voice as it echoes
The heart of a man as he grows will glow
Sing a hymn

Sing a hymn for your brothers
Everybody needs to know
Sing a hymn for your father
And finally, the sun will grow
Sing a hymn for your father
