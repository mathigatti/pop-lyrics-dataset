What have I got to do to make you love me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there


What have I got to do to make you want me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I say when it's all over
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

What do I do to make you love me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I do when lightning strikes me
What do I say when it's all over
What have I got to do
What have I got to do
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
Oh
It's sad so sad
