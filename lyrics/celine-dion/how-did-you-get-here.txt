I've been thinking about you
More than I want to
Spinning me around in this web
Getting in my heart and my head


Hanging on every word
Pretending they go unheard
Wish you didn't make me so weak
Every time I hear you speak

But you do
Yes, you do

I wasn't looking for love
I was comfortable
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)
Tell me who let you in
Shook all my confidence
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)

Can't fight this feeling
My heart's too revealing
Even though it's making me a fool
Can't tell love when to strike, who to choose

You're the one pulling me close
You're the one that I need the most
Wish you didn't make me so weak
Every time you're next to me

But you do
Yes, you do

I wasn't looking for love
I was comfortable
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)
Tell me who let you in
Shook all my confidence
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)

Oh, oh
How did you get here?
How did you? How did you?

How did you scale the walls to my heart?
How did you know where to start?
How did you get here?
How did you get here?

How did you scale the walls to my heart?
How did you know where to start?
How did you get here?
How did you? How did you?

I wasn't looking for love
I was comfortable
How did you get here? (How did you get here)
Tell me who let you in
Shook all my confidence
How did you get here?
How did you? How did you?

Oh, oh
How did you get here?
How did you? How did you?

Oh, oh
How did you get here?
How did you? How did you?
