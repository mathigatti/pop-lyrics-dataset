Now hush
My little one
Don't be afraid
Your daddy's right here


It's just
A little dream
And now it's gone
There's nothing to fear

So close your eyes
I'll sing a sweet lullaby
Lay your head close to my heart

(Chorus)
And sleep tight
The angels hover over you
They spread their wings
To keep you safe and warm
The starlight
In the heavens high above you
Will light a path
To find your way back home
Sleep tight

And now
My sleepy head
Your carriage waits
To take you off to bed

Let go
Your tiny hands
And drift away
To a bright enchanted land

I promise you
Your sweetest dreams will come true
Now leave this weary world behind

(Chorus)

So close your eyes
And wish upon the brightest star
'Cause when you dream
It doesn't matter where you are
Near to me or very far
I'll always be with you

(Whispered)
Sleep tight
Sleep tight
Sleep tight

(Chorus)

Yeah I'll keep you safe
Safe and warm
