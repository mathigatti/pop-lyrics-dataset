You bought me flowers and you sold me a line
You gave me compliments and too much wine
I've played that game, I know all the moves


You show emotion but you hide what you feel
You play the innocent but I've watched you steal
I rest my case you stand accused

But I must confess I was quite impressed
You seduced me with your easy charm
And I must admit I could fall for it

But if love is out the question
There's no point to this affection
I gotta have more than ectasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need
'Cos if love is out the question
Put little heart in your intention
I gotta have more than ecstasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need

You talk in circles when I need a straight line
You've got your principles and I've got mine
We all need commitment that's all I ask
(Is that a crime?)

And I must confess I was quite impressed
I was losing to your winning ways
But I must resist there's no point to this

But if love is out the question
There's no point to this affection
I gotta have more than ectasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need

'Cos if love is out the question I just gotta stop
Little point to this affection
I just wanna stop
It makes no sense to carry on like this
If there's nothing between us you don't know what
You'll miss

No love
There's no love
Baby it's true
There's no love

But if love is out the question
There's no point to this affection
'Cos if love is out the question
Put a little heart in your intention
