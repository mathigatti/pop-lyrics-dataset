There's something shifting in the air
If I'm not mistaken
The dust is clearing everywhere
Memories awaken


My feet on the runway
It's a beautiful day
I look to the sky now
I’m ﬁnding my way

I'm ﬂying on my own
On the wings of your love
I'm ﬂying on my own
On the wings of your love
I’m flying on my own (on the wings of your love)
I’m flying on my own (on the wings of your love)

The warmer winds will carry me
Anywhere I want them to
If you could see what I can see
That nothing’s blocking my view

I look to the sky now
It's a beautiful day

I'm ﬂying on my own
On the wings of your love
I'm ﬂying on my own
On the wings of your love
I'm ﬂying on my own (on the wings of your love)
I'm ﬂying on my own (on the wings of your love)

I'm free like an eagle
Soar like an eagle
Sailing the winds of change
On the winds of change
On the winds of change

My feet on the runway
It's a beautiful day
I look to the sky now
I’m ﬁnding my way
