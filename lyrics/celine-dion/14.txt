When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone


Livin'alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore

All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself
Anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore

All by myself
Don't wanna live

Don't wanna live
By myself, by myself, anymore
By myself, anymore

All by myself
Don't wanna live
I never, never, never
Needed anyone
