you're my life's one miracle 
everything I've done that's good 
and you break my heart with tenderness 
and I confess it's true 
I never knew a love like this 'til you 
you're the reason I was born 
now I finally know for sure 
and I'm overwhelmed with happiness 
so blessed to hold you close 
the one that I love most 
though the future has so much for you in store 
who could ever love you more? 
the nearest thing to heaven 
you're my angel from above 
only God creates such perfect love 
when you smile at me, I cry 
and to save your life I'd die 
with a romance that is pure in heart 
you are my dearest part 
whatever it requires 
I live for your desires 
forget my own, your needs will come before 
who could ever love you more? 
there is nothing you could ever do 
to make me stop loving you 
and every breath I take 
is always for your sake 
you sleep inside my dreams and know for sure 
who could ever love you more?
