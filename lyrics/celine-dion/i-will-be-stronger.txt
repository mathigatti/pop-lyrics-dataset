You were always stronger than me
The first in the deep end
But then the first to leave
And I have missed you so heavily
But the weight's kind of lifting
I'm seeing colors in the street
And though I might have been lonely or lost
I don't feel like giving up just because you climbed off


And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger
I didn't ask to be set free
But in my hour of weakness, I found a sweetness
'Cause sometimes love must die to be born again
One step up a road is not the end

Was just a moment, no souvenirs
No ink in my shoulder, but honey you were here
And I know love wins over pride
I won't outstay my welcome, but love is on my side

And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger
I didn't ask to be set free
But in my hour of weakness, I found a sweetness
'Cause sometimes love must die to be born again
One step up a road is not the end

And I know we said forever
And I know you left your mark
But you gave me a life worth leaving

And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger
I didn't ask to be set free
But in my hour of weakness, I found a sweetness
'Cause sometimes love must die to be born again
One step up a road is not the end
It's not the end
It's not the end
