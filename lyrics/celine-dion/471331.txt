Somewhere over the rainbow,way up high
There`s a land that i heard of,once in a lullaby
 Somewhere over the rainbow,skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,really do come true


Somoday i`ll wish upon a star,and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
  Where troubles melt like lemon drops,away above the chimney tops
   That`s where you`ll find me

   Some where over the rainbow,bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow,why then,oh why can`t i?

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow,why,oh why can`t i?
