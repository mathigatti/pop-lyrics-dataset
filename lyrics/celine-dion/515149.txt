Listen to the magic man
And abracadabra
Your life's in cinerama


Listen to the magic man
A bing a bang a ding a dang
And oops

Roll on
Round and round
On and on
Up and down
Ohhhh, you are in wonderland
Listen to the magic man

Listen to
The magic man
Got a trick that's so slick
Disappears just quick as a lick

Listen to
The magic man
A bing bong
A ping pong
And you are off to hong kong

Roll on
Round and round
On and on
Up and down
Ohhh, you are in wonderland
Listen to the magic man

The wonders
The colours
The others
You're leaving them behind
Bye bye
Oh my, my magic man
Flish, flash fly
You are making me

Roll on
