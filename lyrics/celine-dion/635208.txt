Mama, you gave life to me
Turned a baby into a lady
And mama, all you had to offer
Was a promise of a lifetime of love


Now I know
There is no other
Love like a mothers
Love for her child

And I know
A love so complete someday must leave
Must say goodbye
Oh

Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye

Mama, you gave love to me
Turned a young one, into a woman
And mama, all I ever needed
Was a guarantee of you lovin me

Cus I know
There is no other
Love like a mothers
Love for her child

And it hurts oh
But something so strong
Someday'll be gone
Must say goodbye
Ooh-ah

Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
But the love you give will always live

You'll always be there every time I fall
You are to me the greatest love of all
You take my weakness and you make me strong
And I will always love you till forever comes

And when you need me
I'll be there for you always
I'll be there your whole life through
I'll be there this I'll promise you
Mama

I'll be your leader through the darkest night
I'll be the wings' that guide your broken flight
I'll be your shelter through the raging storm
And I will love you till forever comes

Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
Till we meet again, until then, goodbye
