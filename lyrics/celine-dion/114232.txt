So many 25th's of December
Just as many 4th of July's
And we're still holding it together
It only comes down to you and I


I know you can still remember
Things we said right from the start
When we said that this could be special
I'm keeping those words deep down in my heart

Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by

I've never been much for occasions
You never let a birthday go by
With announcing how much you love me
But the truth was always there -
right there in your eyes

And we're still holding hands when we're walking
Acting like we've only just met
But how could that be - when there's so much
history
Guess that's how true lovers can get

Anoter year has gone by.
