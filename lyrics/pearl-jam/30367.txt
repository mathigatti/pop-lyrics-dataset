Talk of circles, punching out
Looking in, drawing circles down
Falling off the south marking ground
Talking out of turn, drawing circles down


Like Pilate, I have a dog
Like Pilate, I have a dog

Walks me out of town, still one's a crowd
Making angels in the dirt, looking up, looking all around

Like Pilate, I have a dog (obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dog (obeys, listens, kisses, loves)

Stunned by my own reflection
It's looking back, sees me too clearly
And I swore I'd never go there again
Not unlike a friend that
Politely drags you down, you down, you down, you down

Like Pilate, I have a dog (obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dog (obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dog (obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dog (obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
