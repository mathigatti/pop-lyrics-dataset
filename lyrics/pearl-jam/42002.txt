So all you fools
Who sing just like him
Feel free to do so now
'Cause he's dead


Using, using, using, the using takes toll
Isolation, just so happy to be one
Sad to, sad to think, sad to think of him more

Lonesome friend
We all knew
Always hoped
You'd pull through

No blame, no blame, no blame, it could be you
Using, you can't grow old using

So sing just like him, fuckers
It won't offend him
Just me
Because he's dead
