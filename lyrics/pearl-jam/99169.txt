History never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep...
Don't say the words you might regret
I lost before,you know I can't forget...


There was a girl I used to know...
Well,she dealt my love a savage blow...
And I was so young,too blind to see...
But anyway,that's history...

And I say,history never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep...
And there's a light shining in the dark
Leading me on towards a change of heart...

You say I always play the fool...
I can't go on if that's the rule...
Better to jump than hesitate...
I need a change and I can't wait...

I say...history never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep...
And there's a light shining in the dark
Leading me on towards a change of heart...heart...

Never repeats...whoa...

History never repeats
History never re...
Deep in the night it's all so clear...
I lie awake with great ideas...
Lurking about in no man's land...
I think at last I understand...

History never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep...
And there's a light shining in the dark
Leading me on towards a change of heart...

Yeah!
