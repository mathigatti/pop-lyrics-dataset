I got blood
Blood on my hands
The stain of
Of a human
I finally awoke
To my mother's wrath
Call lights
Bed sores and sponge baths


Firstly do no harm
Then put your seatbelt on

Buckle up
Buckle up

The drapes pull back
Reveal her wound
Her boy on her lap
A murderer groomed

Antiquities lost
Lost to the Nile
A sudden slip
A fall on the tile

Firstly do no harm
Then put your seatbelt on

Buckle up
Buckle up
Buckle up
Buckle up
