Have you ever heard the story
Of Mr. Faded Glory?
Say he who rides a pony must someday fall
I've been talkin' to my alter
Says life is what you make it
And if you make it death well then rest
Your soul away
Away away yeah


It's a broken kind of feeling
She'd have to tie me to the ceiling
A bad moon's a comin'
Better say your prayers
I wanna tell you that I love you
But does it really matter?
I just can't stand to see you dragging down
Again, again, again

So I'm singing
This is my kind of love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves you alone
This is my kind of love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind and leaves me alone

I used to treat you like a lady
Now you're a substitute teacher
This bottle's not a pretty, not a pretty sight
I owe the man some money
So I'm turning over honey
He says "oh, Mr. Faded Glory
Is once again doin' time"

This is my kind of love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone
This is my kind of love
It's a crown of thorns
It's the kind that
It's the kind that leaves me alone
Like a crown of thorns
So know who you know
So don't burn your bridges ,'cause
Someday, yeah

So I am singing
This is my kind of love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone
This is my kind of love
It's a crown of thorns
It's the kind that leaves me alone
