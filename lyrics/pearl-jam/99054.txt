Got all night 
Plenty of time 
Take these chains 
From my eyes 
So alive 
Gettin 'it prime 
Take 'em there 
Before you die 
Why be satisfied 
We've got all night 
Please be here 
Top of the stairs 
No place for 
The president 
Build some fears 
Left outside 
Fuck, be content 
To just get by 
Why be satisfied 
We've got all night 
You scream and wail 
You see who cares 
Scream and wail 
See who cares 
Life has nothin' to do with 
Killin' time 
So why be satisfied 
We've got... all night 
We've got all night 
We've got all night
