Through these sleepless nights
i cry for you
And wonder who
is kissing you
Oh these sleepless nights
Will break my heart in two


Somehow through the days
I don't give in
I hide the tears
That wait within
Oh but then through sleepless nights
I cry again

Why did you go ?
Why did you go ?
Don't you know ?
Don't you know ?
I need you

I keep hoping you'll come back to me
Oh let it be
Please let it be
Oh, my love, please end
These sleepless nights for me

Why did you go ?
Why did you go ?
Don't you know ?
Don't you know ?
I need you
Through these sleepless nights
i cry for you
And wonder who
is kissing you
Oh these sleepless nights
Will break my heart in two
These sleepless nights
Will break my heart in two
