Confusion is to commotion
What love is to our devotion
Imperceptibly big
Big as the ocean
And equally hard to control


So save your predictions
And burn your assumptions
Love is friction
Ripe for comfort
Endless equations
And tugging persuasions
Doors open up
To interpretation

Expecting perfection
Leaves a lot to ignore
When the past is the present
And the future's no more
When every tomorrow
Is the same as before

The looser things get
The tighter you become
The looser things get
Tighter

Not one man
Can be greater than the Sun
It's not a negative thought
I'm positive, positive, positive

Falling down
Not staying down
Couldâ€™ve held me up, rather tear me down
Drown in the river

Expecting perfection
Leaves a lot to ignore
When the past is the present
And the future's no more
When every tomorrow
Is the same as before

Numbers keep falling off the calendar's floor
We're stuck in our boxes
Windows open no more
Collecting up the forget-me-nots
Not recalling what they're for
I'm in love with clairvoyants
'Cause they're out of this world

I know the girls wanna dance
Fall away their circumstance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things

I know the girls wanna dance
Clairvoyants in a trance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things

Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back

Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
(Tear me down in the river)
Stand back

Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
(Drowning in the river)
Stand back

I know the girls wanna dance
Away their circumstance
(Tear me down in the river)
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things
(Drowning in the river)

I know the girls wanna dance
Clairvoyants in a trance
(Stand back)
I know the boys wanna grow
Dicks and fix and file things
Their dicks and fix and file things
(Stand back)

Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
(Tear me down in the river)
