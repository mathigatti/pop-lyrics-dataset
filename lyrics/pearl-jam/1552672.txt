All the thoughts you never see
You are always thinking
Brain is wide, the brain is deep
Oh, are you sinking?


Feel the path of every day
Which road you taking?
Breathing hard, making hay
Yeah, this is living

Look for love in evidence
That you're worth keeping
Swallowed whole in negatives
It's so sad and sickening

Feel the air up above
Oh, pool of blue sky
Fill the air up with love
All black with starlight

Feel the sky blanket you
With gems and rhinestones
See the path cut by the moon
For you to walk on

For you to walk on

Nothing left, nothing left
Nothing there, nothing here
Nothing left, nothing left
Nothing there, nothing left
Nothing left, nothing left
Nothing there, nothing here

See the path cut by the moon
For you to walk on
See the waves on distant shores
Awaiting your arrival

Dream the dreams of other men
You'll be no one's rival
Swim the swims of others then
You will be no one's rival

You will be no one's rival

A distant time, a distant space
That's where we're living
A distant time, a distant place
So what ya giving?
What ya giving?
