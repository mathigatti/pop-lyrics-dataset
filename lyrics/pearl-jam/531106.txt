How long must she stand 
Before the ground, it gives way 
To an endless fall 
She can feel this 
War on her face 
Stars on her pillow 
She's folding in darkness 
Begging for slumber 


I'm not blind 
Can see it coming 
Looks like lightning 
In my child's eye 

I'm not frantic 
I can feel it coming 
Violently shakes 
My body 

Her son's slanted 
Always giving her 
The sideways eye 
And empty chair where dad sits 
How loud can silence get? 
And mom, she reassures 
To contain him 
But it's becoming a lie 

She tells herself 
And everyone else 
Father is risking 
His life for our freedoms 

I'm not blind 
I can see it coming 
Looks like lightning 
In my child's eye 

I'm no frantic 
I can feel it coming 
Darling you'll save me 
If you save yourself
