The sun was in clouds, the sun looked out
Exposed a trail of mist and spouts
Ships followed the ancient lead
Deceiving friends under the sea
Wow, imagine that? they won't fight back
I got a theory on that
A whale's heart is as big as a car
A whaler's thought must be smudged by the dark
They won't fight back
I'm sure they know how
Means they love or are too proud
They won't fight back
I'm sure they know how
Means they love or too proud
They swim, it's really free
It's a beautiful thing to see
They sing
Hunters of land, hunters of sea
Exploit anything for money
I refer to anybody that takes advantage of what that is free
They won't fight back
It's only a thought that makes it seem right
What you don't see is because of your sight
Take what you want, kill what you can
That's just one way from the mind of man
Take their lives, sell their parts
But there is not taking of their hearts
If i was lost at sea
That harpoon boat in front of me
It's the whale i'd like to be
They won't fight back
They don't know how
They won't fight back
