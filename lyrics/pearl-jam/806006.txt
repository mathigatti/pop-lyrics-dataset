All behind this smile
it's always in the back of my mind
thought i made it through the hardest of days
sometimes you don't get back what you gave
i'll try to rise
i'll try to call
i'll try as hard to continue on
but it's always here, all the time
always there in the back of my mind
always in the back...
of my mind
the back of my mind
i am not the same
because, because of my...brain
