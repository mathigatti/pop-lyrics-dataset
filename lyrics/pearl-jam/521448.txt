Why deny
All the troubles when combined
With the missing links
It don't feel like
Home now,...


That you're gone
All the troubles
suddenly explained infinitum
You're always wishing and
Never here at
Home

You
All the dreams we shared and
Lights we turned on
But the house is getting dark

And I don't want to know your past
But together share the dawn
And I won't need

Nothing else
Cause when we're dead
We would've had it all

And died
I would've fallen from the sky
Til you
Parachutes have opened now

Heaven knows if there's a ceiling
come so low with the kneeling
Please know that
I got

All the friends I'm needing
Before my light goes out
As the doors are closing now

And far away will be my home
And to grasp this, I don't know
And I don't need

Further back and forth, a wave will break on me today
And love,... Wish the world could go again with love
One cant seem to have enough
And war,.... Break the sky and tell me what it's for
I'll travel there on my own
And love,.... What a different life
Had I not found this love with you
