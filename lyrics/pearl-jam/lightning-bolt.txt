She comes on like a stone
But you don't know where from she was thrown
Like a burning meteor from miles high


Looking for a place to land
She said, "have you got yourself some sand?"
And whatever you replied, she took as yes

Now she comes after thee
With her newly planted seeds and soon
You're prone down on your knees and their you dig

And then before you know the weeds are
Obesely overgrown with all the
Wild seed she sows in your sleep

You gotta know you'll never let her go
She's a lightning bolt

Always something and never nothing
Isn't that the way we're taught to be?
Flipping through the worn out pages
And stages when you knew not who to be
Til the lightning strike sets you free

You gotta know you'll never let her go
She's a lightning bolt

The crashing stormy waves erode her
Shoreline everyday until the
Castle of her ways turn to sand

She holds her lovely breast
As her birds fall from the nest
Flying towards the great northwest, yeh yeh yeh

And with no repair in sight
There is no God with such might
As to open her world wide with subterfuge

And your death will soon arrive
As she finally decides that all her
Problems, the won't die with you
Sheâ€™s a lightning bolt

Never let her go
