Lives opened and trashed
Look ma, watch me crash
No time to question
Why'd nothing last
Grasp and hold on
We're dying fast
Soon be over
And I will relent


Let the ocean swell dissolve way my past
Three days and maybe longer
Won't even know I've left

Under your tongue I'm like a tab
I will give you
What you're not supposed to have
Under my breath I swear by sin
For better or for worse
A best we began

Let the sun climb, oh burn way my mask
Three days and maybe longer
Shed my skin at last
Shed, shed...

Let the sun shine burn way my mask
Three days and maybe longer
Won't ever find me here

Let the ocean dissolve way my past
Four days and not much longer...

Let my spirit pass. Ooh...
This is, this is
This is, this is
This is, this is
This is, this is
My last exit
