It's Ok
It's Ok. It's Ok
It's Ok. It's Ok
It's Ok. It's Ok
You don't have to run and hide away
It's Ok. It's Ok
You know I love you anyway


This is my chance, this is my life
And my hope in an alley way
This is my choice, this is my voice
There may be no tomorrow no

This is my plead, this is my need
And my time is standing free
This is my staff, this is my day
And my world is never the same

It's Ok. It's Ok
You know I love you anyway
It's Ok. It's Ok
You don't have to run and hide away
It's Ok. It's Ok
It's Ok. It's Ok
