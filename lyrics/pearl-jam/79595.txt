Down, fall by the wayside no getting out
Down, cry me a river dried up and dammed
The names can be changed but the place is still the same
I am loaded, told that all's for naught
Holds me down


Rise, life is in motion, I'm stuck in line
Rise, you can't be neutral on a moving train
One day the symptoms fade
Think I'll throw these pills away

And if hope could grow from dirt like me
It can be done
Won't let the light escape from me
Won't let the darkness swallow me
So long
