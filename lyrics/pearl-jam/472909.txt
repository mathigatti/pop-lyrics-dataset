Come sail your ships around me
And burn your bridges down
We make a little history,baby
Every time you come around


Come loose your dogs upon me
And let your hair hang down
You are a little mystery to me
Every time you come around

We talked about it all night long
We define our moral ground
But when I crawl into your arms
Everything comes tumbling down

Come sail your ships around me
