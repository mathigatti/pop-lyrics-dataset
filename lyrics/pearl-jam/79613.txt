I want for to lay down
I'm waiting 'till sundown
I'm searching the haystacks,
Water is sunshine
Wait for the moment, the moment between us
The fire is made now, harder to touch


I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
With it, with you

Baker's dozen parades
Stand and debate
Out single file, nine in a row, swear if you must
Keeping your boots on, float with the now
Hot to the touch
Concrete underground, cast out everyday
Dregs of society
Underbelly, beside me, rejoice and follow thee

I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
With it, with you.
Yeah...

I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get...
