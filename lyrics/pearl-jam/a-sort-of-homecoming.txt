And you know it's time to go
Through the sleet and driving snow
Across the fields of mourning to a light that's in the distance


And you hunger for the time
Time to heal, 'desire' time
And your earth moves beneath your own dream landscape

On borderland we run.
I'll be there, I'll be there tonight
A high-road, a high-road out from here.

The city walls are all come down
The dust a smoke screen all around
See faces ploughed like fields that once
Gave no resistance.

And we live by the side of the road
On the side of a hill as the valleys explode
Dislocated, suffocated
The land grows weary of it's own.

O com-away, o com-away, o-com, o com-away, I say I
O com-away, o com-away, o-com, o com-away, I say I

Oh, oh on borderland we run
And still we run, we run and don't look back
I'll be there, I'll be there
Tonight, tonight

I'll be there tonight, I believe
I'll be there so high
I'll be there tonight, tonight

Oh com-away, I say, o com-away, I say

The wind will crack in winter time
This bomb-blast lightning waltz
No spoken words, just a scream
Tonight we'll build a bridge across the sea and land
See the sky, the burning rain
She will die and live again tonight

And your heart beats so slow
Through the rain and fallen snow
Across the fields of mourning to a light that's in the distance
Oh, don't sorrow, no don't weep
For tonight at last
I am coming home
I am coming home
