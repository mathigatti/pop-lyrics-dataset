I was born
Riding atop a black horse
Whatever prize there was
I could only observe
Where the trouble starts
Where does it end?
How can I be cured?
How, before it ends?


I know life would be different if I held on, held on
I know I could be something if I held on

Gave her life away
Put it in my pocket when it should've been framed
Oh, it lost I'ts shine
Gotta get this outta my head
Out of my bed!
How could it end
End like this?
How could it end?

I know life would be different had I held on!
Held on
I know I could be something had I held on!
Held on
I know I could be something if I held on!
Held on
I know life would be different if I held on!
Held on!

Held on, held on
If I
Held on, held on
If I
Held on, held on
If I
Held on, held on
