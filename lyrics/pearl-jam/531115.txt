There is a marker no one sees it cause of sand
That has covered over all the messages it kept
From misunderstanding what Original Truth was
And now expanding in a faith, but not in love, yeah


What went wrong?

Walking tightrope high over moral ground
Seeing visions of falling up somehow
Oh, do come down

With the living, let what is living love
So unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first
God, what do you say?

Those undecided needn't have faith to be free
And those misguided, there was a plan for them to be
Now you got both sides claiming 'killing in god's name
But god is nowhere to be found, conveniently, yeah

What goes on?

Walking tightrope high over moral ground
Walk the bridges before you burn them down
Do come round

With the living, let what is living love
Unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first
God, what do you say? God, what do you say?

I feel a sickness, a sickness coming over me
Like watching freedom bein' sucked straight out to sea
And the solution? Well, from me far would it be
But the delusion is feeling dangerous to me

What goes wrong?

Walking tightrope high over moral ground
Seeing visions of falling up somehow
Oh, do come down

With the living, let what is living love
Unforgiving yet needing forgiveness first
Oh, what do you say? God, what do you say?

What do you say?

Calling out, calling out
Calling out, calling out...
