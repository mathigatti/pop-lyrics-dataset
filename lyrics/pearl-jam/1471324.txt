I've seen puzzles made out of wood, I've seen games
With pieces and rules
I've deciphered a trick or two at the bar, but there's a lot I haven't figured out
This far


I've come up with riddles and jokes about war
I've figured out numbers and what balance sheets are for
I've understood feelings and I've understood words but the mystery remains
I miss you

You are never more beautiful than at the end of a day
When the world's away
Oh, this way
We can all run away
We can't all disappear
At the end of the day
You come back here...
Here...

It's been a long, long day
And it's hard to say I'm just a drunk
Ohhh, just a drunk
If you can imagine words
All that remains
Ohhh, still I'm just drunk
A puddle in the parking lot

You are never more beautiful than at the end of a day
And the world's away
Oh, we can all run away
But we can't all disappear
At the end of the day
You come back here

You are never more beautiful than at the end of a day
From far away
We can all run away
But we can't all disappear
At the end of the day
You come back here

Back here...
Come back here...
