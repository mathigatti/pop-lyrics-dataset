she looked at me with dignity said 
"there's one thing you gotta see if you know we're headed
for war 
this country's prouder than ever before 
yes there's a spirit in the air, we're more american than
anywhere" 
well i just smiled cuz i could tell this little girl's going to
hell 
now i wouldn't mind if you swallowed my pride 
would make me feel alright, deep inside, feel alright 
all the warmth in her heart can't keep my blood from running
cold 
keep my blood from running cold 
first i fell for her looks, now i just wanna go for the throat 
i tried to tell her a hundred times, this little girl didn't
understand at all 
pride comes before a fall 
now i wouldn't mind if you swallowed my pride 
make me feel alright, deep inside, feel alright 
this ain't the garden of eden 
this ain't the summer of love 
things ain't what they used to be 
there ain't no angels above 
ain't the garden of eden 
ain't no angels above 
things ain't what they used to be
