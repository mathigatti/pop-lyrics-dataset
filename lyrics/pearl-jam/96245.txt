All the photographs were peeling
And colors turned to gray
He stayed in his room with memories for days
He faced an undertow of futures laid to waste
Embraced  by the loss of what he could not replace


There is no reason that she passed
And there is no god with a plan
It's sad. and his loneliness is proof
It's sad he could only love you
It's sad

The door swings to a passing fable
A fate we may delay
We say  holding on delivered in our own brace
He let 'em as he laid in bed
Hoping that dreams would bring her back
It's sad  and his loneliness is proof
It's sad  he could only love you
It's sad

Holding his last breath
Believing he'll make his way
But she's not forgotten
He's haunted he's searching for escape

If just one wish could bring her back
It's sad  and his loneliness is proof
It's sad he will always love you
It's sad
