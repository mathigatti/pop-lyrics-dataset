Oh, please don't go out on me
Don't go out on me now
Never acted up before
Don't go on me now
I swear I never took it for granted
Just thought of it now
Suppose I abused you
Just passing it on


Go
Fuck

Once fastened, servile
Now you're getting sharp
Moving, oh, so swiftly
With such disarm
I pulled the covers over him
Shoulda' pulled the alarm
Turned to my nemesis
A fool, not a fucking god

No
Time
Suck
My

Please
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please, oh

Suck
Blood
Touch
Please
Tunnel vision
Tuck
Time
See

Please, please, please
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please
Don't you want me
Don't go on me
Please
Don't go on me
