Power high, power low
You could take 'em all to school
You could fly, wilt the stilt had nothing on you
Lambchops and afro-do, Milwaukee Bucks and a barbecue
#33 just like you


Sweet Lew, how could you?
Sweet Lew, makin' me blue

A Laker trade their Bobby-D for a house, a guru by the sea
A little help from 32, showtime, and worthy
Those were the days, pre-investment spree

Sweet Lew, is it true?
Sweet Lew, how could you?

I grew up trying to copy you, Bruce Lee, and a kung-fu
Act a jazzman, yogi too
Little did i know, a loose screw
But you had your own shoe
Build him high, build him tall, a taiku with a basketball
Tear 'em down, one and all
7'2" is a long way to fall

Sweet lew, how's the view?
Sweet lew, how could you?.
