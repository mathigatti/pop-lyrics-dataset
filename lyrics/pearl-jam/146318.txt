Hand over my face
I am related to my enemy


Our house on fire and big brother, brother tried to put the blame on me

Oh, little sister, You and me can rise above
Oh, ain't no brother, back to back to back
Oh better back on

You use the flag as a bandage
Oh my big brother's a pocket hypocrisy

In the closet, my pleasures 'cause big brother,
Brother don't wanna just let me be

Oh, little sister, You and me can rise above
Oh, ain't no brother, back to back to back
Oh better back on

Oh, little sister
You and me can walk alone
Oh, ain't no brother, back to back to back
Oh better back on

Hey, now (brother)
Hey, now
Hey, now
Hey, now

In my mind there's a clearing
Rose gardens open grey skies
Oh no one's hurtin'
and I'm joyin'
I'm flying ... I'm flyin'

Oh, back to back to back, oh better back on -
back to back to back, back c'mon -
back to back to back to back to back, back

Hey, now (brother)
Big (hey now) brother, brother, brother
Hey, now
Brother (hey now)
