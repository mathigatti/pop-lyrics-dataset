We had this bright idea one late summer night
Candy-coated popcorn strung
Like a beaded curtain hung over your
Door


I guess the heat got to it
Dripped and melted all over the
Floor

Chocolate-covered cherries
In tin foil boats float around the
Floorboard

I had to laugh, not to cry
Now all your possessions
All of your things
All of your hopes

Schemes, desires
And most of all
Your dreams

All gone away
Gone away
All gone away
Gone away
All gone away

Live for today, you said
Live for today
I had to laugh, not to cry
