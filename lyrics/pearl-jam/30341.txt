All in all, it`s no one's fault
Excuses turn to carbon walls
Blame it all on chemical intercourse


The swallowed seeds of arrogance
Breeding in the thoughts of ten
Thousand fools who fight irrelevance

The full moon is dead skin
The one down here`s wearing thin
So set up the ten pins
As the human tide rolls in
Like a ball that`s spinning

Bombs dropping down
Overhead, underground
It's instilled, to wanna live
Bombs dropping down
Please, forgive our hometown
In our insignificance

Turn the jukebox up, he said
Dancing in irreverence
Play C-3, let the song protest

The plates begin to shift
Perfect lefts come rolling in
I was alone and far away
When I heard the band start playing
On the lip, late take off

Bombs dropping down
Overhead, underground
It's instilled, to wanna live
Bombs dropping down
Please, forgive our hometown
In our insignificance

Feel like resonance of distance
In the blood, the iron lies

It's instilled, to wanna live
Bombs dropping down
Please forgive our hometown
In our insignificance
In our insignificance
