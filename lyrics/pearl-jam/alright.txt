You can't hide the lies
In the rings of a tree
If your heart still beats free
Keep it for yourself


When you want to run
And leave some part unrevealed
Like the flight of the bee
Keep it for yourself

It's alright to be alone
To listen for a heartbeat, it's your own
It's alright to quiet up
To disappear in thin air, it's your own

Should your living truth die
Could be an acid trip
Leave the Eucharist whole
Keep it for yourself

If you tire of the game
Hit the road towards the clouds
Find your groove in the sound
Keep it for yourself

It's alright to say no
Be a disappointment in your own home
It's alright to turn it off
Ignore the rules of the state, it's your own
It's alright to shut it down
Disappear in thin air, it's your home
It's alright to be alone
To listen for a heartbeat, it's your own

You can't hide your eyes
