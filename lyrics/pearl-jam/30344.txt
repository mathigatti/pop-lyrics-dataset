I'm wishing you a well
Mind at peace within your cell
Covers up I cast you off
I'll be watching as you breath
I lie still, you move, I send
You off around the bend
I hold your head deep in my arms
My fingertips they close your eyes
Off you dream my little child
There's a sun around the bend
There's a sun around the bend
All the evenings close like this
All these moments that I've missed
Please, forgive me, won't you, dear?
Please, forgive and let me share
With you around the bend...
You're an angel when you sleep
How I want your soul to keep
On and on around the bend...
