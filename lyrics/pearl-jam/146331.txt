When people keep repeatin'
TThat you'll never fall in love
Everybody keeps retreating
But you can't seen to get enough


Let my love open your door (X3)
To your heart
Let my love open the door (X2)

When everything feels all over
Everybody seems unkind
I'll give you a four-leaf clover
Take all worries out of your mind

Let my love open your door (X3)
To your heart
Let my love open the door
To your heart
Let my love open the door

Have the only key to your heart
I can stop you from fallin' apart
Tried to say in my own way
Somebody give me the chance to say
Let my love open your door
It's all I'm lookin' for
And erase yourself from misery
There's only one thing that's gonna set you free

"When tragedy befalls you
Don't let it drag you down
Love can cure your problems
You're so lucky I'm around"

Let my love open your door (X3)
To your heart
Let my love open the door
To your heart
Let my love open the door (X5)

Oh...to your heart
Oh...baby,I know I said,I said,I said,I said,I said,I said...
...I said,I said,I said,I said,I said,I said...
Oh...na na na...let my love open the door...
Let my love... (X2)
