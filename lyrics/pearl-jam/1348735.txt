The sun come up it was blue and gold
Sun come up it was blue and gold
Sun come up it was blue and gold
Ever since I put your picture in a frame


I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
Ever since I put your picture in a frame
I'm gonna love you till the wheels fall off
Oh yeah

I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
Ever since I put your picture in a frame
I love you baby and I always will
Ever since I put your picture in a frame
Ever since I put your picture in a frame
