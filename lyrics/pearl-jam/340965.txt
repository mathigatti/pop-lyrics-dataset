You fool
Dude what do you think you're doing
So you're lost
My problem last night(?)
Conductor says
Off of my train
Be understood(?)
Guess those relationships ain't my thing
Even if I could
You ain't the kinda person I would help anyway
I'm about to explode
Cause I can't carry your load
Hitchiker


You're cool
You're coke and your calculations
We're friends
Only because of my situation
I'm about to unload
Cause I can't carry your load
Hitchhiker

So be gone
Too soon is too late
I don't want no delay
So be gone
Get you're food off someone else's plate
Go tell all of your friends
I'm an idiot(?)and your great
Hitchhiker
Now Go...
