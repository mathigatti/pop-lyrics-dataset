Consider me an object
Put me in a vacuum
Free of all conditions
Free of air and friction


Yea, i\'ll be hanging upside down.
And there i will swing
For all eternity

Fell it rising, yea next stop falling
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling

Consider me an abscess
Leave me in my vacuum
Blood on all the pistons
Running my transmission

Feel it rising, yea next stop falling
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling

Feel it rising, yeah next stop falling
Feel it rising

High above i'll break the law,
If it's illegal to be in love,
Leave the hatred, on the cross

Yea i'll be hanging upside down and here i will swing
For all eternity

Feel it rising, yea next stop falling
Feel it rising, comatose with no fear of falling

Feel it rising, yea, next stop falling
Feel it rising

Something never thought you'd be part of
