I've got our love to remember
that will never change
I have you in my head
and no, i'll never hold you
and i'm still asking why
I guess that this is goodbye
my dreams suddenly seem so empty
I could go on my own, but i feel like playin' dead
and for what feels like the first time
I don't know where you are tonight
I guess that this is goodbye
we lived half our lives together
a hundred years is a lot of weight to bear
and the sun, it may be shining
but there's an ocean in my eyes
cause i know that this is goodbye
