Someday at christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
one warm december our hearts will see
A world where men are free


Someday at christmas there'll be no war
When we have learned what christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at christmas time

Someday at christmas we'll see a land
With no hungry children
No emtpy hand
One happy morning people will share
A world where people care
Someday at christmas
There'll be no tears
When all men are equal
No man has fears
One shining moment
One prayer away
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at christmas time

Someday at christmas
Men will not fail
Hate will be gone
And love will prevail
Someday a new world
That we can start
With hope in every heart
Someday at christmas
Someday at christmas time (2x)
