Hear the sirens
Hear the sirens


Hear the sirens
Hear the circus so profound
I hear the sirens
More and more in this here town

Let me catch my breath to breathe
And reach across the bed
Just to know we're safe
I am a grateful man

The slightest bit of light
And I can see you clear
Oh, have to take your hand
And feel your breath for fear this someday will be over

I pull you close, so much to lose knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didn't care before you were here
I danced in laughter with the ever after
But all things change
Let this remain

Hear the sirens
Covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer
Will they come for me next time?

For every choice, mistake I've made, it's not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay I'll wait, I'll understand

Oh, it's a fragile thing
This life we lead
If I think too much I can get overwhelmed by the grace
By which we live our lives with death over our shoulders

Want you to know that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above, too
I study your face, the fear goes away

It's a fragile thing, this life we lead
If I think too much I can get overwhelmed by the grace
By which we live our lives with death over our shoulders

Want you to know that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above, too
I study your face, the fear goes away
The fear goes away
The fear goes away
The fear goes away

Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh
