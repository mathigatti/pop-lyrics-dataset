Like an angel, fly over your house
Like an angel, pass out wishes
Like an angel, I will move the arrow
Like an angel, I live alone..
I'm not living what was promised
I am close but cant enjoy..
Oh, I'm not dying
Oh, I'm so tortured
Cause I see all
Tortured, and all I cannot do
Tortured, all I should have done
Tortured, while I occupied a man..
I'm not living what was promised
I am far from glorified..
Oh, I'm not dying
Oh, I'm not alone...
Mind is not a celestial state
With idle hymns of praise
Time is short, I have an appointment at noon
At noon in hell..
Across the waste of space and fields of air
I glide, alone at night
Oh please, please think of me
Cause I'm, I'm by your side...
I'm by your side... I'm by your side...
Ohhh.. I'm, I'm right in front of you..
I'm by your side.
