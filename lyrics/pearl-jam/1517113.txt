What were all those dreams we shared
Those many years ago?
What were all those plans we made
Now left beside the road?
Behind us in the road


More than friends I always pledged
Cause friends they come and go
People change as does everything
I wanted to grow old
Just want to grow old

Slide on next to me
I'm just a human being
I will take the blame
Bust just the same
This is not me
You see
Believe
I'm better than this

Don't leave me so cold
Or buried beneath the stones
I just want to hold on
And know I'm worth your love
Enough
I don't think
There's such a thing

It's my fault, now I been caught
A sickness in my bones
How it pains to leave you here
With the kids on your own
Just don't let me go

Help me see myself
Cause I can no longer tell
Looking out from the inside of
The bottom of a well
I yell
It's hell
But no one hears

Before I disappear
Whisper in my ear
Give me something to echo
In my unknown futures ear

My dear
The end
Comes near
I'm here
But not much longer
