You'll be going out with radio
Going out with disco going out like bacchanal
I'll be ging out with telephone
Going out alone to the radar zone


It's all just inadvertent, imitation
And I don't mean mine
It's all across this nation
If it's just inadvertent, simulation
A pattern in all mankind
What's got the whole world fakin' it?

I'll be playing with my magazine
Using up my listerine like ovaltine
And you'll be, you're dippin' in your battleship
For the latest tip for the latest dream

It's all just inadvertent, imitation
And I don't mean mine
It's all across this nation
If it's just inadvertent, simulation
A pattern in all mankind
What's got the whole world fakin' it?

If it's just inadvertent, imitation
A pattern in all mankind
What's got the whole world fakin' it?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin' it?
Yeah
