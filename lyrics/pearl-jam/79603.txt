Drive down the street can't find the keys to my own fucking home
I take a walk so I can curse my ass for being dumb
I make a right after the arches, stinking grease and bone
Stop at the supermarket, people stare like I'm a dog


I'm gone to Lukin's...
I gotta spot at Lukin's
Unlock the door at Lukin's...
Open the fridge
Now I know life's worth

I find the key but I return to find an open door
Some fucking freak who claims I fathered, by rape, her own son
I find my wife. I call the cops. This day's work's never done.
The last I heard the freak was purchasing a fucking gun.
