Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel. [2x]
I'm goin' to the roadhouse, gonna have a real good time.


Back of the roadhouse we got the bungalows.
Back of the roadhouse we got a little bungalow,
Just for the people who like to go down slow.

So let's roll, baby roll...
Let's roll, baby roll... [2x]
Let's roll...all night long...

Roll, roll, roll, gotta feel my soul, alright...
Gotta roll, roll, roll, .otta feel my soul...
Hey now...

Passion lady...passion lady...
Give up your vow...give up your vow...
Save our city...save this city, right now...
I woke up this morning, and got myself a beer... [4x]
Said roll...the end is always near...

I said roll, baby roll...
Roll, baby roll...let it roll, baby roll...
Let it roll...all night long...
