I got a car, I got some gas
Oh, let's get out of here, get out of here fast
Oh, everyone's confused so I stay in my room
If I go i dont want to go alone


I'll hope you get this message or you're not home
I could be there in ten minutes or so
Oh, I got my things
We'll make it up as we go alone
With you I could never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone
