Tell me what I wanna hear
This suits too good to be true
My dear


Tell me lies
Tell me lies, tell me
Tell me lies, tell me

Help me

Storybook keeps from hurting me
You see
Shell of the man from the sea

Tell me lies
Tell me lies, tell me
Tell me lies, tell me

Tell me why
Tell me why, tell me
Tell me why, tell me
Tell me lies

Help me

Reservoir of hate and fear
Invisible, in repair
A hundred theives cast a spell
This is hell

Help me

The man they call my enemy, I've seen his eyes
He looks just like me, a mirror

The more you read, we've been deceived
Everyday it becomes clearer
Clearer, clearer, clearer

Not my enemy
No, not my enemy
Don't speak for me, no, not my enemy.
