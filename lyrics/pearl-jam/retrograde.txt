Comes the summer rain
Cue the lightning and far off thunder again
Projecting through the clouds
In meditations, lifting out in the sound


The more mistakes, the more resolve
It's gonna take much more than ordinary love
To lift this up

Stars align they say when
Things are better than right now
Feel the retrograde spin us 'round, 'round
Seven seas are raising
Forever futures fading out
Feel the retrograde all around, 'round

Accelerate the change
Feeling equal and opposite all the same
Momentum rearranged
Shout, the echo, returning back but now changed

The rusted shapes refuse to fall
It's gonna take much more than ordinary love
To lift this up

Stars align they say when
Times are better than right now
Feel the retrograde spin us 'round, 'round
Seven seas are raising
Forever futures fading out
Feel the retrograde all around, 'round

Hear the sound
In the distance now
Could be thunder
Or a crowd

(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
