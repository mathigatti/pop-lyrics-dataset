She nursed him there, over a night
I wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay
What to say what to say
But soon she was down, soon he was low
At a quarter past a holy no
She had to turn around
When she couldn't hold, oh she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never, the safest path
A dissident, a dissident is here


And to this day, she's glided on
Always home but so far away
Like a word misplaced
Nothing said, what a waste
When she had contact with the conflict
There was meaning, but she sold him to the state
She had to turn around
When she couldn't hold she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never, the safest path
A dissident, a dissident is here

She gave him away when she couldn't hold no she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never, the safest path
A dissident, a dissident is here
Couldn't hold on she couldn't hold no she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest place
A dissident is here
