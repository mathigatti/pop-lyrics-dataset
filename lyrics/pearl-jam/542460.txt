Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy,
Are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.


Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me
Like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letterbox
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are
Ringing through my open ears exciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are
Ringing through my open ears exciting and inviting me

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva om
