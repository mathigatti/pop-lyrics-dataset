It's out of my hands, making all hands meet
Stumble as it's crumbling out of reach
It's in the cards of destiny
Your sanity in tow
Designate my luck
Resignate


This power has no roots to guide, no role
Trust me, rusted minds refuse to go
Unwillingness, it's meaningless
To walk away in vain
Designate my will
Designate my will
Resignate

My will is crashing, synapses flashing slow
Days like frame by frame, where do they go?
Yeah, why fight? Forget it
Can't I spend it after I go?

Roll them high
Throw them again
All Gods' dice

Monkey driven, call this living, ha ha ha
Too much thought, it's overwrought, a hole
Minding yours, what's mine, not yours
Will finish us off
Designate my life
Designate a view
Designate my will, my will, my will, I will
Resignate my god
