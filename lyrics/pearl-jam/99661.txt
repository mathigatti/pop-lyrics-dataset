Sonic Reducer

I don't need anyone, don't need no mom and dad
Don't need no good advice, don't need no human rights
I got some news for you, don't even need you too
I got my time machine, got my 'lectronic dream
Sonic reducer, ain't no loser...oh...
Got a sonic reducer, sonic reducer...


People out on the streets, they don't know who I am
I watch them from my room, they are just passing by
I'm not just anyone, said I'm not just anyone
I got my time machine, got my little 'lectronic dream
Sonic reducer, ain't no loser...oh...
Sonic reducer, sonic reducer...ahhh...

I'll be your bearer soon, love on some cotton doom
Things will be different then, the sun will rise from here
Then I'll be ten feet tall, then you'll be nothing at all
I got my time machine, got my 'lectronic dream
Sonic reducer, ain't no loser...oh...
Sonic reducer, sonic reducer...oh...
Sonic reducer, sonic reducer...yeah...
Sonic reducer, sonic reducer, sonic reducer...oh...
