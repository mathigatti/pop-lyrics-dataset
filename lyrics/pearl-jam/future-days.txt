If I ever were to lose you
I'd surely lose myself
Everything I have found, dear
I've not found by myself


Try and sometimes you'll succeed
To make this man of me
All my stolen missing parts
I've no need for anymore

I believe
And I believe, 'cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me

Back when I was feeling broken
I focused on a prayer
You came deep as any ocean
Did something out there hear?

All the complexities and games
No one wins, but somehow they're still played
All the missing crooked hearts
They may die, but in us they live on

I believe
And I believe 'cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me

When hurricanes and cyclones raged
When winds turned dirt to dust
When floods they came or tides they raised
Ever closer became us

All the promises at sundown
I've meant them like the rest
All the demons used to come round
I'm grateful now they've left

So persistent in my ways
Hey, angel, I am here to stay
No resistance, no alarms
Please, this is just too good to be gone

I believe
And I believe, 'cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me
You and me
Days, you and me
