Well mom and dad said we could
So I did what I should
I hung my stocking on a wall
I didn't get a thing at all


I dont believe in Christmas (3x)
'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year

Well stayin' up late
To see Santa Claus fly
Well sure enough don't ya know
The fat boy didn't show

I dont believe in Christmas (3x)
'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year

Well I tried to get a little kiss
From a pretty little miss
She slapped me down and said "You jerk,
Mistletoe doesn't work"

I dont believe in Christmas (3x)
'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year
Oh right!

Well wakin' up the reindeer
Makin' little kids cheer
The reason that his nose shine
Santa gave him moonshine

I dont believe in Christmas (3x)
'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year

Ah decorate the street light
People lookin' to get right
One hand will slap ya back
The other one will take ya back

I dont believe in Christmas (3x)
'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year

I dont believe in Christmas (5x)
'Cause I didn't get nothin' but fear.
