So all you fools
Who sing just like him
Feel free to do so now
Cuz he's dead


Using, using, using, the using takes toll
Isolation, just so happy to be one
Sad to, sad to think, sad to think of him more

Lonesome friend
We all knew
Always hoped you'd pull through

No blame, no blame, no blame
It could be you
Using, you can't grow old using

So sing just like him
Fuckers, it won't offend him
Just me
Because he's dead
