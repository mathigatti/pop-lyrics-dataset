Out of my mind...out of my mind... 
All of the time... 


Wish you could help me mister... 
Wish you could lift me up... 
Wish you could pack my parachute mister... 
Wish you could pull me up. 

The winds have change, I'm stuck beneath the rain... 
I wish you could help me up... 
Out of my mind...out of my mind... 
Once inside, I'm out of my mind... 
Out of my mind...out of my mind... 
Once inside, I'm out of my mind... 

Wish you could help me, give me a pill... 
Just a little drink that I could swill. 
A little something, anything, anything, I'll try all... 

I ain't got nowhere to go from here. 
I'm just about this far 
From drowning in my very own tears. 
Out of my mind...out of my mind... 
Once inside, I'm out of my mind... 
Out of my mind...out of my mind... 

I don't feel so hot... 
out of my mind... 

Where do I go? Where do I stay? 
I got no place to lay in the hay. 
Where do I go to soothe my head? 
Guess I'll turn on music instead. 
Where do I see? Where do I shine? 
No one wants to take my mind. 
Where do I go? How do I feel? 
Guess I'll waste away in here... 

Out of my mind...out of my mind.... 
Out of my mind every single time...
