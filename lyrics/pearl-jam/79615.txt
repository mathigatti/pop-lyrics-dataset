Don't need a helmet, got a hard hard head
Don't need a raincoat, I'm already wet
Don't need a bandage, there's too much blood
After a while seems to roll right off


They're whipping
They're whipping
They're whipping
They're whipping

Don't need a hand, there's always arms attached
Don't get behind I can't fall back
Why must we trust all these rusted rails?
They don't want no change, we already have

They're whipping
They're whipping
They're whipping
They're whipping

Don't mean to push but I'm being shoved!
I'm just like you, think we've had enough
I can't believe a thing they want us to
We all got scars they should have them too

They're whipping
They're whipping
They're whipping
They're whipping
They're whipping
They're whipping
They're whipping
They're whipping
