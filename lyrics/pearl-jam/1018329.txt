Hanging out of Second Avenue
Eating chicken vindaloo
I just want to be with you
I just want to have something to do
Tonight, tonight, tonight,tonight,tonight,tonight


Well allright.
Tonight, tonight, tonight,tonight,tonight,tonight
Wait-Now
Wait-Now
Hanging out all by myself

Cause I don't want to be with anybody else
I just want to be with you
I just want to have something to do
Tonight
