Cold wind blows on the soles of my feet
Heaven knows nothing of me
I'm lost, nowhere to go
Oh, when I was a kid
Oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's Christmas time


Flowered winds was where I lived
Thought you burned, not froze for your sins
Oh, I'm so tired, and cold

Oh, when I was a kid, oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's Christmas time
Oh, oh, when I was a kid, oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's Christmas time

Oh, oh, when I, if I was a kid, oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me dream, it's Christmas time
