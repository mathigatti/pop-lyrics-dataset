She don't wander in, don't wander in here, she
She don't wander in here, don't wander in here


The direction of the eye, so misleading
The defection of the soul, nauseously quick
I don't question our existence
I just question our modern needs

She don't wander in, don't wander in here, she
She don't wander in here

I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk with my face blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of stone, yeah

After all is done, and we're still alone
I won't be taken, yet I'll go with my hands bound
I will walk with my face blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of stone

I don't show, I don't share
I don't need, yeah
What you have to give

Oh, I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk with my face blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden, oh

I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk into your garden, garden of stone

I don't know, I don't care
I don't need you for me to live, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Uh, huh, huh
