You're always saying that there's something wrong
I'm starting to believe it's your plan all along
Death came around, forced to hear it's song
And know tomorrow can't be depended on


Seen the home inside your head
All locked doors and unmade beds

Open sores unattended
Let me say just once that

I have faced it, a life wasted
I'm never going back there again
I escaped it,a life wasted
I'm never going back there again
Having tasted, a life wasted
I'm never going back there again

The world awaits just up the stairs
Leave the pain for someone else
Nothing back there for you to find
Or was it you you left behind

You're always saying you're too weak to be strong
You're harder on yourself than just about anyone

Why swim the channel just to get this far?
Halfway there, why would you turn around?

Darkness comes in waves tell me
Why invite it to stay?

You're one with negativity
Yes, comfort is an energy
But why let the sad song play?

I have faced it, a life wasted
I'm never going back there again

Oh I escaped it, a life wasted
I'm never going back there again

Having tasted, a life wasted
I'm never going back there again

Oh I erased it, a life wasted
I'm never going back there again
