Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' 'till the evening's done
Watchin' the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time


I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
I've got nothin' to live for
Looks like nothing's gonna come my way
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Looks like nothing's ever gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people want me to
So I guess I'll remain the same,ohh

Sittin' on a roll in my bones
This loneliness won't leave me alone
2,000 miles I've roamed
Just to make this dock my home
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
Sittin' here restin' my bones
This loneliness won't leave me alone
2,000 miles I've roamed
Just to make this dock my home
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
