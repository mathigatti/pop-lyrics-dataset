It's a hopeless situation 
and i'm starting to believe 
that this hopeless situation 
is what i'm trying to achieve 
but i try to run on 
it's all or none
all or none...
here's the selfless confession 
leading me back to war 
can we help that our destinations 
are the ones we've been before? 
i still try to run on 
but it's all or none
all or none...
to myself, i surrender 
to the one i'll never please 
but i still try to run on 
no, i still try to run on 
but it's all or none
all or none...
