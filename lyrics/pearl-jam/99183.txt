Thieves in the window
Trouble down the hall
The resin white ceiling
Blood, dripping, flows
Out on the front line
Preachers sweep the earth
Out on their backsides
With nothing in common, with no problem


She's just a girl...
Just...just a girl, yeah...
Just one time around
She has little chance to make good
Distance of her lie
Decided in the woods

Burning fires
She's led to police
This maid in progress
Betrayin' your mother's need for a shelter

Oh, just a girl
Just...just a girl
Just one time around
She had little chance to make good
Treats them now, she's young
But it can be taken away
Just one time around...can be taken away
We all make mistakes

Hush my baby...don't you cry...
You're my little alibi
Oh baby, please...I need some sleep
Hmm, now be taking
You with me

Just a girl  (5x).
