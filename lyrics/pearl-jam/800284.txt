Oh, something to remember me by
Oh, something to place in your hand
Oh, something so you will feel all grown up when you call my name
Oh, I'm falling down, down
I'm falling
I don't know when I'll be up
Before your call, please remember
Frozen like stone, yeah
He'll be flesh and blood
I'll be gone
Oh, just a memory passing like pages in a book
I'm falling down
I'm falling
I'm falling
Don't know if I'll get up
You're a boy
You're a boy
You're a boy
I know why you'll be
Can't guess your side
Oh, no, the cry of a newborn child
Can't feel the heat
Of something fresh coming
Can somebody hide me
I cannot apolo
I cannot apolo
I cannot apologize
