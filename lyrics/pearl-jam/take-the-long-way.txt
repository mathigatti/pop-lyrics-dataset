You got me through these feelings
That separate me from you
I put myself through a beating
I need you to pull me through


I'll break through these feelings
I'll break through the ceiling

I always take the long way
The long way
I always take the long way
That leads me back to you

I always take the long way
The long way
I always take the long way
That leads me back to you

Now's the time to resurface
Take back me and you
The hammer will fall on purpose
Our time, our truth

I'll break through these feelings
I'll break through the ceiling

I always take the long way
The long way
I always take the long way
That leads me back to you

I always take the long way
The long way
I always take the long way
That leads me back to you

Plant a seed in your mind
What's yours is mine
Show me how to live divine
What's yours is mine

Back to a moment in your mind
Go back in time
Show me how to live divine
What's yours is mine
