Drowning in their dissertations
Random speakers in my mind
Yeah, they never stop their fortifications
And blocking my precious time
You used to let it go and let it float away
You don't get to speak with twice as much to say


It's all in the delivery
I said the messenger who is now dead
Was all on the periphery
I didn't see him but I heard what he said
Aw, sideways talk, poisoning our thoughts
Everyone walks and it's no one's fault

Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction

Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction

Home is where
The broken heart is
Home is where
Every scar is

Blinking stars, beneath you roam
Room to tomb and cradle to grave
All the answers will be found
In the mistakes that we have made
Oh, oh, oh

One bad ear and one eye blind
It takes a village but don't take mine
Living forwards in a backwards town
I feed 'em drinks just to watch 'em drown
Swallow my pencil and bleed out my pen
Surrender the wish we'll be together again
And I won't give up
I won't give up
On satisfaction, satisfaction

Gave up on satisfaction

Pull myself aside on a sleepless night
Sadness blurs, I'm in need of a light
Out of balance, balance, balance this time
I'm feeling fading, calling as I'm falling out of sight
As the silence gets louder my heart gets pounding
And ventricles pumping, working overtime
Our freedoms fraught with danger being circumscribed
A life cut short and circumcised
A rubble of commandments from the road, step aside
A rubble of commandments in the road, step aside

Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Satisfaction
