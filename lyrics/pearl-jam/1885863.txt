Take off your hat, kick off your shoes.
You know you ain't goin' anywhere.
Spend all your time singin' your blues.
You know you ain't goin' anywhere.


You've always been a good friend of mine
But you always say farewell.
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well.
In the wishing well.

Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself.
Or is that what you're tryin' to do?
Put up a fight you believe to be right
And one day the sun will shine through.

You've always got somethin' to hide.
Somethin' you just can't tell.
And the only time that you're satisfied,
Is with your feet in the wishing well.
In the wishing well.

But I know what you're wishing for.
Love in a peaceful world.
Love in a peaceful world.
Love in a peaceful world.

You've always been a good friend of mine
But you always say farewell.
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well.

In the wishing well.
In the wishing well.

Everybody's got a dream.
And they take it to the wishing well.
Everybody's got a dream.
Wishing well.
