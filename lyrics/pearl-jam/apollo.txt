Wuz the deal yall
I don't mean to come through and and break yall vibe
But I just got to slow it down for just a second
So bear wit me you know first before I do that
I just wanna talk about how people always say
Yo that's too nasty and why your mouth so vulgar
Why why you gotta sing all these nasty records and all that
But I be representing the ladies and we got something to say
We been quiet too long lady-like very patient
We didn't get mad when Prince has his ass out
We thought he was gone turn around to the front
And have the front out too but you know that didn't happen
We always had to deal wit wit the guy you know
Talking about how they gone wear us out on records
And and you know I had to do records that strictly representing for my
Ladies and and how to keep your man
Keep his eyes from wandering looking around
And sex is not a topic that we should always sweep underneath
The rug
And I'm not saying go out and do it but if you do
Strap it up before you smack it up, flip it, slow it down
Oh nooo Jimmy drop it
