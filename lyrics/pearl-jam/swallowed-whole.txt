I can feel the dawn, I can feel the earth
I can feel the living all around
I can choose a path, I can choose a word
I can start the healing, bring it now, bring it now


Whispered songs inside the wind
Breathing in forgiveness
Like vibrations with no end
Feel the planet humming
What is clear far from the noise, gets swallowed whole

I can feel the sun, I can see the sound
I can set myself right hear and drown
I can feel the rush, I could clear the clouds
I could set the needles spinning loud
I can hear the crash, I can feel the pound
I can feel the current pulling down,down, down, down

Whispered songs inside the wind
Breathing in forgiveness
Like vibrations with no end
Feel the planet humming
What is clear far from the noise, gets swallowed whole

With no quiet to be found
Spirit lifted off the ground
And what lies beyond the grave
Might be welcomed change
And will come, come what may
With no rest in peace
Until that day

I could choose a path, I could choose the word
I could start the healing, bring it now
I could be the sun, I could be the sound
I could set myself right here and drown

Whispered songs inside the wind
Breathing in forgiveness
And the chapter I have not read
Turn the page
