I said..
I'm back in a circle
Don't feel like coming out
I don't belong here


I see you're a nothing
I say there's something
You're so special
So fucking special

I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
Oh what are we doing here?
I don't belong here

Stay there tonight
I say that I'm soldier
All alone here
And not a sin

Oh nothing...
All down here...
You're so special
You're fucking special

I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
Oh what am I doing here?
I don't belong here
To lose..
Run to lose...
Run, run, run...
