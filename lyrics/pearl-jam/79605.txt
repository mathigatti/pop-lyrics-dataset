Restless soul, enjoy your youth
Like Muhammad hits the truth
Can't escape from the common rule
If you hate something, don't you do it too, too


Small my table, sits just two
Got so crowded, I can't make room
Oh, where did they come from? Stormed my room
And you dare say it belongs to you, to you

This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh, not for you, ah, you

(Scream, my friends don't call me
Friends, no, they don't scream
My friends don't call, my friends don't)

All that's sacred comes from youth
Dedication, naive and true
With no power, nothing to do
I still remember, why don't you? Don't you?

This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh, never was for you, fuck you
This is not for you
Oh, this is not for you, yeah, you
This is not for you
Oh, not for you
Oh, you
