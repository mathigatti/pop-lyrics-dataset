Once divided
Nothing left to subtract
Some words when spoken
Can't be taken back
Walks on his own
With thoughts he can't help thinking
Future's above
But in the past he's slow and sinking
Caught a bolt of lightning
Cursed the day he let it go


Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something?
Nothingman

She, once, believed
In every story he had to tell
One day she stiffened
Took the other side
Empty stares
From each corner of a shared prison cell
One just escapes
One's left inside the well
And he who forgets
Will be destined to remember

Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something?
Nothingman

Oh, she don't want him (she don't want him)
Oh, she won't feed him
After he's flown away
Oh, into the sun
Yeah, into the sun
Burn (burn), burn, burn

Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something?
Nothingman

Nothingman
Nothingman
Coulda been something
Nothingman
