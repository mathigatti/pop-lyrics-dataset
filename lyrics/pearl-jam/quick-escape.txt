Reconnaissance on the corner
In the old world not so far
First we took an aeroplane
Then a boat to Zanzibar
Queen cracking on the blaster
And Mercury did rise
Came along where we all belonged
You were yours and I was mine
Yeah, yeah


Had to quick escape
Had to quick escape
Had to quick escape
Had

Crossed the border to Morocco
Kashmir then Marrakech
The lengths we had to go to then
To find a place Trump hadn't fucked up yet
Living life on the back porch
Lifting rocks to make a wage
Every sunset paid attention to
Not a starry night went to waste

Had to quick escape
Had to quick escape
Had to quick escape

And here we are, the red planet
Craters across the skyline
A sleep sack in a bivouac
And a Kerouac sense of time
And we think about the old days
Of green grass, sky and red wine
Should've known so fragile
And avoided this one-way flight

Had to quick escape
Had to quick escape
Had to quick escape
Had (uh-uh-uh-uh)
