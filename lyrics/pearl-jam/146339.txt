Behind her eyes there's curtains
And they've been closed to hide the flames, remains


She knows their futures burning
But she can smile just the same, same

And though her mood is fine today
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways

Standing, like a statue
A chin of stone, a heart of clay, hey

And though he's too big a man to say
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways

Drifiting away, drifting away, drifting away
Drifiting away, drifting away, drifting away
