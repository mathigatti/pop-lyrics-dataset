Sheets of empty canvas
Untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me
As her body once did


All five horizons
Revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed
Has taken a turn

Oh, and all I taught her was everything
Oh, I know she gave me all that she wore

And now my bitter hands
Chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh, the pictures have
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything

I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter
So, why do I sear?

Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can drop away?

And now my bitter hands
Cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see
All that I am
All that I'll be, yeah

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky, but why? Why? Why
Can't it be, oh, can't it be mine?
