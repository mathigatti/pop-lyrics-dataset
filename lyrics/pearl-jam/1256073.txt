Can I have some water up? 

(You're the man, Eddie)

(Eddie, you're the man)

There's no way 
To tell to be sure
Ticket I'm a-wantin'
This bus it's makin' way 
Too many stops
I can't get a-movin'
Where's my destination? 
I take a deep swallow 
In my frustration
I'm takin all I got
It fits 
In this little bag
All my life 
I had empty pockets
All my life 
I saw evil eyes 
In old dark sockets
I cut 'em off
I cut 'em off
I said 
"I don't need them 
to make life work"
I cut 'em off
I cut 'em off
I'll never think twice 
If to them 
I never ever talk


So here I go
I'm finally on my way
Once I said goodbye
That was my last wave
Here I am on the
On the open road
I've never felt better 
Then when I am alone 
(Eddie)
