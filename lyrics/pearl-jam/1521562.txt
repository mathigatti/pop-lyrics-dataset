Yesterdays how quick they change
You're lost and long gone now
It's hard to remember anything
Moving at the speed of sound
Moving with the speed of sound


And yet I'm still holding tight
To this dream of distant light
In that somehow I'll survive
But this night has been a long one
Waiting on a sun that just don't come

Can I forgive what I
Cannot forget and live a lie
I could give it one more try

Why deny this drive inside
Just looking for some peace
Everytime I get me some
It gets the best of me
Not much left to see

And yet I'm still holding tight
To this dream of distant light
In that somehow I'll survive
But this night has been a long one
Waiting on a word that never comes

A whisper in the dark
Is that you or just my thoughts
While I'm awake and reaching out

It's gone so quiet now
Could it be I'm farther out
Moving faster than the speed of sound
