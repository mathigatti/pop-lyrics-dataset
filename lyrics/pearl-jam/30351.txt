Watched from the window, with a red mosquito
I was not allowed to leave the room
I saw the sun go down, and now it's coming up
Somewhere in the time between


I was bitten, must have been the devil
He was just paying me
A little visit, reminding me of his presence
Letting me know, he's a-waiting, oh

Red man's your neighbor, call it behavior
While you're climbing up slippery hills
Two steps ahead of him, punctures in your neck
Hovering just above your bed
Hovering just above your bed

I was bitten, must have been the devil
He was just paying me
A little visit, reminding me of his presence
And letting me know, he's a'waiting, he's a'waiting
Ooh

If I had known then what I know now
If I had known then what I know now
If I had known then what I know now
If I had known then what I know now
