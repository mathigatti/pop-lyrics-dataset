The fruit of love was in the future
Around the corner and over the hill
The act of love was slowly pounding, slowly pounding, slowly pounding


The Holy War was slowly building
Heroes leaving for the Great Crusade
Seek reward in the ever after, ever after, ever after

Don't wanna have to lose you, baby
Don't want to have to take you back
You know I'll never lose you, baby, abuse you, baby, use you, baby

You know I'll always help you baby, but you know I just can't do that
I know I said I'd help you baby, here's ny wallet, call me sometime

Act of love... (x4)

The fruit of love was in the future
Around the corner and over the hill
The act of love was slowly pounding, slowly pounding, slowly pounding

Act of love... (x4)
