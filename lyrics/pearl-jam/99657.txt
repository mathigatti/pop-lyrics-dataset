In the moonlight.
Gettin', why out to get back. It's a...
Steady shore to her land.
It's gettin' closer to the fence.
In the moonlight.


Given'. Two lost wings
A beautiful star sea.
A wonderful sense of beauty.
In the moonlight...
It's a love drawn nearer.
Darkened days are spent in.

A night bird is followin' you all the time.

Under a star-lined ceiling...
And darkness so sleep. Ah,...
Your sense is revealed...
In the moonlight
It's a love drawn nearer.
Darkened days are spent in.

A night bird is followin' you all the time.

It's a love draw nearer
Darkened days are spent in

A night bird is followin' you,... it's followin' you.
A night bird is followin' you all the time.
