Free the people,oh...got your love,whoa... (X2)

Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
(X2)


I'm special...'cause I'm gonna make you see
Nobody loves you,nobody like me
I'm special,so special
I got to have some of your attention,give it to me
'Cause I'm...
I'll kick the fuck out of you

Peaceful times have come and gone
It's time to fuckin' kill somebody
I try,don't blame me
I try,peacefully
That time has come and gone,now it's just me
Just me...this means nothin' no more
This don't mean nothin' no more
I don't want to see this no more
Unless you're ready,'less you're ready,to stand behind it...
I don't give a fuck
Let the words that you say to me
Unless the actions sustain it
It's meaningless...
We're all meaningless

The world will go on
And we're all meaningless
The world will spin
We're all meaningless
I refuse,I refuse,to believe
We're meaningless,meaningless
We're meaningless,I refuse...
I won't give up,yeah...
Meaningless...we're not meaningless
We're not invisible...we're not meaningless
If you love someone,tell 'em
Show them the way that you feel
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel (X3)
Oh...
