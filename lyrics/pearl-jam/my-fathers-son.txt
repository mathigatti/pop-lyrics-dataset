I come from a genius, I am my father's son
Yeah, too bad he was a psychopath
And now I'm the next in line
Loneliness, dear mother, yes, surely she's a work of art
Might never got top dollar
But she gave us all a star


Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool don't hurt me
Can I beg a release
From the volunteer amputee?

From the moment I fell
I called on DNA
Why such betrayal
Got me tooth and nail

Yeah, how's about one conversation
With nothing else left to be had
(Oh, is this) your young long lost son
And he's never had dear old dad
I forget the insemination and for that I'm s'posed to be glad
What a pity you left us so soon
To climb your mountain of regret

Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool dark and deep
Can I beg a release?
Can I volunteer amputee?

From the moment I fell
I called on DNA
Why such betrayal?
Oh I gotta set sail

Oh real bright light shining
As you're trying to breathe in thin air
Cannot forget you're hiding
Collected wounds left unhealed
When every thought you're thinking
Sinks you darker than the new moon sky
The faraway lights rising
In the whites of your eyes

Now father you're dead and gone
And I'm finally free to be me
Thanks for all your fucked-up gifts
For which I've got no sympathy

I'm living in a walled-up place
In the bounds of 5th symphony
Thanks for this and thanks for that
I gotta let go, learn to see

Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool don't hurt me
Can I beg a release?
Can I volunteer amputee?

From the moment I fell
I called on DNA
Why such betrayal
Oh I gotta set sail
