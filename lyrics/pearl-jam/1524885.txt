Heading south the compass reads
Look at our speed, we're going 63
Look out the window as the trees go green
I look at them and they look at me.
I got Neil Young on the stereo
He comes along whenever I go
There's something different as I hear him now
Heading south on a familiar route.


I can feel the lifting of my blues
I can see you wipe your eyes anew
I got the feeling I just can't lose
Pulling into Santa Cruz.

I got an old friend, he remembers me
From way back when we were 17
We've got kids and we're older now
But when I see him we're still 17
I need the beach to set me free
I need the wind to make me breathe
I need the water to wash my soul
I need my loved ones to let me go

I can feel the lifting of my blues
I can see you wipe your eyes anew
I got the feeling that I just can't lose
Pulling into Santa Cruz.

Up in the northwest we've got it good
A little soggy, but we've got it good
Can't help thinking that I wish I would
Move my ass down to Santa Cruz
I got the feeling that I just can't lose
Pulling into Santa Cruz
I got a feeling that I just can't lose
Pulling into Santa Cruz
I got a feeling I don't wanna lose
Pulling into Santa Cruz
I got a feeling that I just can't lose
Pulling into Santa Cruz.
