Freezin', rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, feelin', maybe he'll see a little better set a days, ooh yeah
Oh, hand out, faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, oh, yeah
Oh, dark grin, he can't help, when he's happy looks insane, oh,  yeah


Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again

Kneelin', looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read, ooh yeah
Oh, prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything, oh
Oh, feelin', understands the weather of the winter's on its way, oh
Oh, ceilings, few and far between all the legal halls of shame, yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away
Yeah!

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again, yeah
Oh, whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away
Yeah!
