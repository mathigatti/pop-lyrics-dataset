Yes, I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Yeah, I'm a lucky man, to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah, others, they've got none


Stay with me
Let's just breathe

Practiced all my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed

Stay with me
You're all I see

Did I say that I need you? Oh!
Did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean

I wonder every day, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Everything you gave
And nothing you would save, oh, no
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave

Did I say that I need you?
Oh, did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean, ah

Nothing you would take
Everything you gave
Hold me til I die
Meet you on the other side
