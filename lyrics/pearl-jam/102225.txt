Oh, he deals them off, off the top, ties them off
Fills it up with his past, gets carried away
Oh, half his life, a hand-me-down, wasted away
Oh, he fills it up with the love of a girl


Oh, he left it alone, drilled the pain with money to buy

How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway

Oh, he chose a path, heavy the fall, quarter to four
Fills his mind with the thought of a girl

How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway
Getaway
