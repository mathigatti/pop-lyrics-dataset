I admit it
What's to say
I'll relive it
Without pain


Backstreet lover on the side of the road
I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a sixteen gauge buried under my clothes
I play

Once upon a time
I could control myself
Ooh, once upon a time
I could lose myself

Try and mimic
What's insane
I am in it
Where do I stand?

Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet
I pray

Once upon a time
I could control myself
Ooh, once upon a time
I could lose myself

(You think I got my eyes closed
But I'm looking at you the whole fucking time)

Once upon a time
I could control myself
Once upon a time
I could lose myself

Once upon a time
I could love myself
Once upon a time
I could love you

Once
Once
Once
Once
Once
Once
