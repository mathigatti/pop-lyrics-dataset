I'm gonna save you fucker,not gonna lose you
I'm feeling cocky and strong, can't let you go
Too important to me, and too important to us
We'd be lost without you
I'm there, let yourself fall,
I'm right below you now


And fuck me if i say something
You don't want to hear, from me
And fuck me if you only hear
What you wanna hear, from me, if i care
But i'm not leaving here

You helped me when i was down,
I'll help when you're down
Why are you hitting yourself?
C'mon and hit me instead
Let's pick up your will,
It's grown fat and lazy
It's sympathetic as well,
Don't go on me now

And i'm not living this life without you,
I'm selfish and clear
And you're not leaving here without me,
I don't wanna bewithout...
My best friend
Wake up to see you could have it all
Whoa!

Cuz there is but you,
And something within you
Has taken control,
Let's beat it
Get up, let's go
Oh, you're in your own world,
Let's see the whole world!
Let's pick up your soul

And fuck me if i say something
You don't wanna hear from me (fuckme)
And fuck me if you only hear
The tremble in your head
Please help me to help you
Help yourself!
Help me help yourself
Help me, please want me to
Please let me to, help you...
