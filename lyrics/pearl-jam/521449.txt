Big man stands behind an open door
Said, leave your lady on the cement floor
Got some kicks, want to take a ride?
I said, yeah!
Take your pick, leave yourself behind
I said, yeah!


I've no fear but for falling down
So look out below I am falling now
Oh, please, understand I just need, my friend
A way a way a way home

Tried to walk, found a severed hand
Recognized it by the wedding band

Said it's ok, do you want some more?
I said, yeah!
Said you'll see dragons after 3 or 4
I said, yeah!

Under stand I'm not falling down
I said, look around, the rooms taller now
I can't close my eyes, 'cause I see the sound in waves
In wave, lets me stay calm

If I don't lose control
Explore and not explode
A preternatural other plane
With the power to maintain

Like a tear in all we know
Once dissolved we are free to grow
What is human, what is more?
I'll answer this when I get home
