My lips are shakin', my nails are bit off
Been a month since I've heard myself talk
All the advantage this life's got on me
Picture a cup in the middle of the sea


And I fight back in my mind
Never let's me be right, oh
I got memories, I got shit
So much it don't show

I walked the line
When you held me in that night
I walked the line
When you held my hand that night

An empty shell seems so easy to crack
Got all these questions, don't know who I could even ask
So I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream
Where I'm not ugly and you're lookin' at me

And I'll stay in a bed
Water blue,I've seen it
If just once, I could feel loved
Oh, stare back at me, yeah

But I walked the line
When you held me in that night
Oh, I walked the line
When you held my hand that night
Oh, I walked the line
When you held me close at night
I paid the price, never held you in real life
