There's a light when my baby's in my arms
There's a light when the window shades are drawn
Hesitate when I feel I may do harm to her
Wash it off 'cause this feeling we can share
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air


Byzantine is reflected in her arms
There's a cloud, but the water remains calm
Reaching in the sun's fingers clutch the dawn to pass
Even out it's a precious thing to bear
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air

It's not in my past to presume love can keep on moving in both directions
How to be happy and true is the quest we're taking on together
Taking on

There's a light when my baby's in my arms
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air
Yes, I know she's reached my heart
