Sailing on my every step
Inching off of the earth
Is magnified by the things I've done
The thing that I've become
Every lift of my hand
Coffee cup up, and back
Is magnified by the things I've done, the things I've seen, the things I've caused
I'm a dead man walking
The hammer that I once brung down now hovers over me
Cast a shadow across, onto me
The hallways are all mocking me
What I've become they're all mocking me


I'm a dead man walking
A dead man walking
A dead man walking
I'm a dead man walking
Dead man walking
Dead man walking
