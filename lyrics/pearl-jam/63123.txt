This broken wheel is coming undone
And the road's exploding
But you're keeping me strong
Rolling along with you
Love is a tower, and you're the key
Leading me higher, when you let me in
Keeping us close (so close)


Oh, on down the line
Sometimes I burn like a dot on the sun
With no one knowing
But you're keeping me strong
Moving along with you
You are a tower, of strength to me
The darkening hour, sees light again
Again

Ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah
You are, you are, you are, you are
You are
Love is a tower, of strength to me
I am the shoreline, but you're the sea
The sea
You are, you are
