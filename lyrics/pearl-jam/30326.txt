I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings
Made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks
Or apologize


I couldn't breathe
Holding me down
Hand on my face
Pushed to the ground

Enmity gauged
United by fear
Forced to endure
What I could not forgive

I seem to look away
The wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface
Most defiled

Head at your feet
Fool to your crown
Fist on my plate
Swallowed it down

Enmity gauged
United by fear
Tried to endure
What I could not forgive

Saw things
Saw things
Saw things
Saw things
Clearer
Clearer
Once you
Were in my
Rearview mirror

I gather speed
From you fucking with me

Once and for all
I'm far away
Hardly believe
Finally the shades are raised

Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
Rearview mirror

Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
Rearview mirror

Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
Rearview mirror

Saw things so much clearer
Once you
Oh yeah
