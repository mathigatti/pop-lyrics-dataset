I got an unfortunate feeling
I been beaten down
I feel that I'm done believing
Now the truth is comin' out


What they're taking is
More than a vow
They're taking young innocents
And then they thrown 'em on a burning pile

And all along they're saying
"Mind your manners"

I caught myself believing
That I needed God
And if it's out there somewhere
We sure could use hymn now

Try my patience!
My patience tried
This world's a long love letter
That makes me wanna cry

And all along they're saying
"Mind your manners"
That's all they're saying

Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve a mystery

Right round the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

And all along they're saying
"Mind your manners"
Always praying

Go to heaven
That's swell!
How you like your living in hell?

Go to heaven
That's swell!
How you like your living in hell?
