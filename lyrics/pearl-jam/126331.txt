Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Til I stay, would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Oh take my hand, take my whole life too
Cuz I can't help falling in love with you
And I can't not help falling in love...
With...
You
