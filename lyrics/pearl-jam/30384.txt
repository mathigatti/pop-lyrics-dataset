And I wished for so long, cannot stay
All the precious moments, cannot stay
It's not like wings have fallen, cannot stay
But still something's missing, cannot say


Holding hands of daughters and sons
And their faiths are falling down
I have wished for so long
How I wish for you today

Will I walk the long road? Cannot stay
There's no need to say goodbye

All the friends and family
All the memories going round
I have wished for so long
How I wish for you today

And the wind keeps rollin'
And the sky keeps turning gray
And the sun is set
The sun will rise another day

I have wished for so long
How I wish for you today
I have wished for so long
How I wish for you today

Will I walk the long road?
We all walk the long road
