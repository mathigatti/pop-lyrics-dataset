He says to her he wants it easy.
He expects her to be easy.
He wants it to be easy.
But she says no.
But she says no, I don´t want to.
She says no, she says no, I don´t want to
He expects it to be easy...


But she says stop, you gotta stop.
When he says go, you still gotta stop.

When she says stop, you gotta stop.
When he says go, you still gotta stop.

He wants it... he wants it...
So badly he wants, he wants it...
But she says no... she says no...
She says, ´Go to hell if that´s all you want me for´...
She says no...

When she says no, you gotta stop.
When he says go, you still gotta stop.
When she says no, you gotta stop.
When he says go, you still gotta stop...

She did nothing to deserve it.
He just wants, he wants to observe it.
We sit back like they taught us.
Keep quiet like they taught us.
He does nothin´ to remove it.
He´s touches her `cause he wants to prove it. 
We sit back like they taught us.
Keep quiet just like they taught us.
He just wants, he wants to prove it.
He´s touches her...she don´t remove it.
We sit back like they taught us.
Like they taught us, like they taught us...
