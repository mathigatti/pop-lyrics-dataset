Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight, to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven


Don't cry, don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

Sally, take my hand
Travel South cross land
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder

The Exodus is here
The happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older

Teenage wasteland
It's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland
(It's only) teenage wasteland
