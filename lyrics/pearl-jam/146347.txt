Trouble, oh trouble set me free
I have seen your face and its too much for me today
Trouble, oh trouble cant you see
You're eating my heart away, and theirs nothing much left of me


I've drunk your wine
You have made your world mine
so won't you be fair
oh won't you be fair

I don't want no more of you
So won't you be kind to me
And let me go there
I have to go there

Trouble, oh trouble move away
I have seen your face and its too much for me today
Trouble, oh trouble can't you see
You have made me a wreck, now wont you leave me in my misery

I've seen your eyes
And I have seen deaths disguise, oh hanging on me
oh hanging on me

I'm deep and torn
I'm shattered and lost and worn
So shocking to see
Too shocking to see

Trouble, oh trouble please be kind
I dont wanna fight, and I havn't got a lot of time...
