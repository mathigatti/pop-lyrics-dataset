The sirens scream wanton attention...
Time to take head and change direction...
Time to take stock and make ommisions...


Evacuation, Evacuation

Time to take leave all formal functions...
Time to plant seeds of a reconstruction...
No time this time to feign reluctance...

It's like you're waiting for a diamond shore to wash yourway...
Bets put aside, you're evil... Let's crawl into your face...
A vision, vague or not, raising a frightful wake-you-up

Time for... Evacuation, Evacuation, Evacuation, Evacuation

Evacuation, Evacuation

There was a solemn man who watched his twilight dissapear
(In the sand)
Altered by a fallen eagle, a warning sign...
(In the sand)
He sensed worry could be strength, with a plen said,

Time for... Evacuation, Evacuation, Evacuation, Evacuation

Evacuation, Evacuation, Evacuation, Evacuation
Evacuation, Evacuation, Evacuation, Evacuation
