Here, far away
One could feel the earth vibrate


Moon changing shape and shade
As we all do under its gaze

Yellow moon on the rise
Yellow moon on the rise

Round we go
Where we stop, yeh no one knows
So tonight, the moon I go

Yellow moon on the rise
Yellow moon on the rise

An echo that rings
A bullet unchained
One life, one grave
Joins the parade

The sky grows dark
With fallen stars
Who'd come so far
A headstone engraved
The colors turns grey
The black and white fades

Yellow moon on the rise
Yellow moon on the rise

Yellow moon on the rise
Yellow moon on the rise
