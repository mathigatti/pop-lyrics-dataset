Sailing on my every step 
Inching off of the earth...
He's magnified 
By the things I've done
The thing that I've become


Every lift of my hand, 
Coffee cup up and back,
Is magnified 
By the things I've done
The things I've seen, the things I've caused,
I'm a dead man walking.

The hammer that I once brought down now hovers over me.
Casts a shadow, a cross/across onto me.

The hallways are all mocking me.
What I've become they're all mocking me.

I'm a dead man walking. A dead man walking. A dead man walking.
I'm a dead man walking. Dead man walking. Dead man walking.
