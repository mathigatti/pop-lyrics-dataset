Don't you think you oughtarest
Don't you think you oughta lay your head down
Don't you think you want to sleep
Don't you think you oughta lay your head down tonight


Don't you think you've done enough
Oh, don't you think you've got enough, well, maybe
You don't think there's time to stop
There's time enough for you to lay your head down, tonight
Tonight

Let it wash away
All those yesterdays

What are you running from?
Taking pills to get along
Creating walls to call your own
So no one catches you drifting off and
Doing all the things that. we all do

Let them wash away
All those yesterdays (echo)
All those paper plates
All those yesterdays
All those yesterdays

You've got time, you've got time to escape
There's still time, it's no crime to escape
It's no crime to escape, it's no crime to escape
There's still time, so escape
It's no crime, crime

All those yesterdays
All those yesterdays
All those yesterdays
All those yesterdays
