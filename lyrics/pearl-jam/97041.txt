Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness
Crashed, then on their way
Father he enjoyed collisions
Others walked away
A snowflake falls in may


And the doors are open now
As the bells are ringing out

Cause the man of the hour
Is taking his final bow
Goodbye for now

Nature as its own religion
Gospel from the land
Father ruled by long division
Young men they pretend
Old men comprehend

And the sky breaks at dawn
Shedding light upon this town
They'll all come around

Cause the man of the hour
Is taking his final bow
Goodbye for now

And the road
The old men paved
The broken seams along the way
The rusted signs
Left just for me
He was guiding me
Love, his own way

Now the man of the hour
Is taking his final bow
As the curtain comes down
I feel that this is just goodbye for now
