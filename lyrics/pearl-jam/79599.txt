Just like a person having sex feels cared for
We wanna be loved, so we have sex together
And they feel loved about that
And this is the way it makes me feel loved
I want it, I dream about it, I think about it, I want it
Just like a girl wants sex with a boy, you know?
It's the way I'll always be probably

There's something really screwy about no streaking
Is it any old dumb mop? It streaks
Come on mop, no streaking mop
I don't mind mop the floor, my mop streaks, I don't like it
It's not me, it's the mop

Come, I bought some new mops
Go away you stupid, the most won't mop
I don't mop, now the floor looks beautiful
I don't mop, old sponge mop
The most won't mop it
The most won't mop it
The most won't mop it
You're right, this mop's stupid
The most won't mop it
I don't mop...now the floor looks beautiful
That's why they call me mophandlemama

The twenty-third of may
Even though she disturbed no one today
The manager told her to completely forget
I'll never do it again, I swear

How do I tell the whole world that I'm mentally ill?
Or that I'm crazy?
I wanna come home and I wanna settle down
I can go out in the world and not act crazy
And, I can still fantasize, but I keep it to myself
Keep it to myself...keep it to myself

Very much so...
Think I deserve to be loved
Keep it to myself, keep it to myself
Do you have a gun?
I think I deserve to be loved, don't you?
To be loved, don't you?
But I keep it to myself
Keep it to myself, keep it to myself
I think I deserve to be loved, don't you?
And, I can still fantasize, but I keep it to myself
Keep it to myself, keep it to myself
I think I deserve to be loved, don't you?
Very much so

Do you ever think that you would actually, really kill yourself?
