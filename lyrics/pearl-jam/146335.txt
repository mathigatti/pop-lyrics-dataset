Doctor said I, I'd be alright
Oh, everything that I believed it wasn't true
I found it out when I got close to you
I thought you were different, like a dream
Things they ain't never what they seem, whoa


Thought I could trust you with my soul
But you can't do that anymore
The doctor said I'd be alright, but I still feel blue
The doctor said I'd be alright, but I still love you

Love you ,hate you...
Love you, want you, hate you...
Oh, yeah...

I'm different
Me, myself, I'm different than all the rest
I can only speak for myself and peolple can trust me
