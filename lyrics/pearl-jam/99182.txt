I seem so overcome, yeah
Words seem so out of place
Words they fall off my altar
How did I get to this place?


Seems so, sounds so familiar
Lost in my dying, cold cry
All their dreams, there's a million, yeah
So does it feel time to say a prayer?

Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

Words they seemed out of place
Words they seem out of place
Falling out on my face, yeah
Words just seem out of place
