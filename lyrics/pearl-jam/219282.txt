I've got a feelin', a feelin' deep inside, oh yeah...oh yeah...
I've got a feelin', a feelin' I can't hide...oh no no...whoa no...
Yeah, yeah, I got a feelin', yeah...
Oh please believe me, I'd hate to miss the train...oh yeah...oh yeah...
Ooh, and if you leave me, I won't be late again, no no no, oh no...

And I don't understand, how come nobody told me?
Why I'd want to sing like Milli Vanilli
All I ever wanted was someone who looked like you...you...oh...

Uh huh, I got a feelin', I think that everybody knows, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah...
Yeah, wow, I got a feelin', yeah...whoa...

Everybody had a good year, though we never saw the sunshine
Everybody had a wet dream, making Temple was a good time
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Everybody made a movie, everybody had one line
Everybody misses Andy, we'll be seein' him in no time
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Ooh yeah, I got a feelin', yeah...oh...

I got a feelin', a feelin' deep inside, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah...
Ooh, I got a feelin', a feelin' i can't hide, oh no no, oh no...
Yeah...I got a feelin', yeah...yeah...ah...ooh...yeah...
