Oh, oh, oh

I see the world, feel the chill
Which way to go?
Windowsill
I see the words on a rocking horse of time
I see the verse in the rain


Oh dear dad, can you see me now
I am myself, like you, somehow
I'll ride the wave where it takes me
I'll hold the pain, release me
Ooh, ooh I, ooh, ooh

Oh dear dad, can you see me now?
I am myself, like you, somehow
I'll wait up in the dark for you to speak to me
I'll open up, release me
Release me, release me, release me
Ooh, ooh I, ooh, ooh, ooh
