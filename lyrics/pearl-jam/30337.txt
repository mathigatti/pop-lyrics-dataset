Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Glide me towards
You know something's left
And we're all allowed
To dream of the next


Oh, the next time we touch

You don't have to stray
Tho oceans away
Waves roll in my
Thoughts hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore

I will be, I will be there once more
