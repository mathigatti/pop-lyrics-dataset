I wish I was a neutron bomb
For once I could go off
I wish I was a sacrifice
But somehow still lived on


I wish I was a sentimental
Ornament you hung on
The Christmas tree, I wish I was
The star that went on top

I wish I was the evidence
I wish I was the grounds
For fifty million hands up raised
And opened toward the sky

I wish I was a sailor with
Someone who waited for me
I wish I was as fortunate
As fortunate as me

I wish I was a messenger
And all the news was good
I wish I was the full moon shining
Off a Camaro's hood

I wish I was an alien
At home behind the sun
I wish I was the souvenir
You kept your house key on

I wish I was the pedal break
That you depended on
I wish I was the verb to trust
And never let you down

I wish I was the radio song
The one that you turned up
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I guess it never stops
