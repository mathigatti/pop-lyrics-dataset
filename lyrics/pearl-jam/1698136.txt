She came from a happy home, a very happy home
A very happy home


Miss personality, a grade 'A' student naturally
She had it all worked out


But things aren't what they seem
Is this real or just a dream
And things will never ever be the same again

She came from a happy home, a very happy home
A home of happiness

Miss personality, a grade 'A' student naturally
She had it all in place

But things aren't what they seem...

The dangers
Its the dangers of love
The dangers
Its the dangers of love

She came from a happy home, a very happy home
A very happy scene

She caught him with another it turns out it was her mother
What a tragedy

Can things be what they seem
Is this just some crazy dream
Things may never ever be the same again

The dangers...

Keep telling li..ie..es, but you did
You know you did, its coming, its coming, its coming

The dangers...

What went wrong she couldn't tell
But we know it all too well

The dangers...

The dangers...

The dangers...
