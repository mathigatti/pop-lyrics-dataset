Paint a picture visions only grey
Light your pillow, lay back
Watch the flames
I'll tell a story but no one would listen that long


It's hard to imagine
It's hard to imagine
Ohh

Tear into yourself count days on your arm
Ah the beating ticking like a bomb
After having seen all that they saw

It's hard to imagine
It's hard to imagine
Ohh

Things were different then, all is different now
I tried to explain
Somehow things were different then
All is different now
I tried to explain, somehow
Ohh

Things were different then, all is different now
I tried to explain. I hope this works somehow
Things were different then, all is different now
I tried to explain
Oh, somehow
Ohh
