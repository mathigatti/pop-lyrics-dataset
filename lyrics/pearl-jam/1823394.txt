Sometimes there's no star shining
Scouting the edge of the universe
Sometimes you can't see a horizon
Between the ocean and the earth


And just when you were thinking about slinkin' down
I'm gonna pull you up - i'm gonna pull ya round
May i remind you of that scene?
The spirit is our gasoline
May i remind you of that scene?
We were arms aloft in aberdeen
May i remind you of that scene?
Let a million mirror balls beam
May i remind you of that scene?

And you say 'living ain't nothing but hassles'
In a manilla envelope rain
And driving coal all-night to newcastle
It's getting to be a repetitive strain
And just when you thought you're going down the drain â€¦

May i remind you of that scene?
The spirit is our gasoline
May i remind you of that scene?
We were arms aloft in aberdeen
May i remind you of that scene?
Let a million mirror balls beam
May i remind you of that scene?

I'm gonna pull you up - i'm gonna pull ya round

May i remind you of that scene?
The spirit is our gasoline
May i remind you of that scene?
We were arms aloft in aberdeen
May i remind you of that scene?

Let a million mirror balls beam
The spirit is our gasoline
May i remind you of that scene?
We were arms aloft in aberdeen

They say the stars can't see their rays
Nor can they count their numbered days
No flower can says what perfume is
We got all this and bird and diz

May i remind you of that scene?
We were arms aloft in aberdeen

May i remind you of that scene?
