Blisters on my fingers, blisters on my brain
Blisters on the voices, crazy makes insane
There's an angry sea, an ocean in my eyes
The waves are rolling, I'm becoming blind
I won't be taken, won't take myself
Kicking and screaming, have to knock me off the shelf
Feels like illusion, is this taking place?
Disease of confusion, stripped of our grace


Don't wanna believe it, these endless miles
Never destination, just more denial
More denial

Some resolution, some justice tied
To this collusion hiding in plain sight
Say see ya later, never say goodbye
This is a little trick I play on my own mind
I am a recluse in search of new friends
Are they gonna find me back where the road ends?
Off in the distance, leviathans
50 foot and breaking on our innocence

Don't wanna believe it, these endless miles
Never destination, just more denial
More denial

I can't believe it, these endless lies
Never destination, just more denial
More denial

When you make the drop, the gaping maw
When you make the drop, the gaping maw
Makes us alive, should we survive
When you make the drop, the gaping maw
Keeps us alive, survive
When you make the drop, the gaping maw

Thank you Bob Honey, thanks Paul Theroux
If I ever die, then to this place let me go
Off in the distance, leviathans
50 foot and breaking on my innocence
I won't be taken, won't take myself
Kicking and screaming, have to knock me off the shelf
Say see ya later, never say goodbye
This is a little trick I play on my own mind

Don't wanna believe it, these endless miles
Never destination, just more denial

She was a singer in a rock 'n' roll band
Had command of all her voices
Turned herself into a hologram
It all came down to choices
So I say 'til then, never say goodbye
A little trick I play on my mind
