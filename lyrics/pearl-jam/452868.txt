I was born in a pool
Left in my mother's stand
I spat at that surgeon and his tremblin' hand
When I felt for life I was the nursery boy
I stole the doctors scalpel and I slit the cord...


I was a Catholic boy...
I was Redeemed, detained...I be joy...

I was two months early, they put me under-class
I screamed and cursed at children with the nurse's pass
Was convicted of theft as I slid from the womb
They took me straight from my stroller to a cell in the tombs...

I was a Catholic boy...
Redeemed, detained...I be joy...

They starved me for weeks, they thought they'd teach me fear
I fed on cell-mates trees, it gave me flyin' ideas
When they cut me loose, the time it served you well
I made allies up in Heaven, and comrades in Hell

I was a Catholic child...
with the grand red...the grand wild...

I make angels dance and drop to their knees
When I enter a church the feet of the statue bleed
I understand the faith of all my enemies
With that Christ and a God, it's never me...

I'm a Catholic boy...
I was Redeemed, detained...and I be joy...

I watched His sweetest psalms stolen by the choir
I dreamed of all his bones hangin' from a wire
I take the contribution, I get absolution
I make the resolution to verify my soul...

I'm a Catholic boy...
Redeemed, detained...I be joy...

And they can't touch me now, I got every size of the...
They got Baptism, they got Penance
I got Communion, I got extreme...
Damn...I got Confirmation...

I was a Catholic boy...
Redeemed, detained...and I be joy...
And now, I'm a Catholic man...
I put my tounge to the rail whenever I can...
