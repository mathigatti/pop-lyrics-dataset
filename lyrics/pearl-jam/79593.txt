Who's got the brain of JFK?
What's it mean to us now?
Oh, it's sound insurance
But I can tell you, this is no lie


The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved

You, you been taught
Whipped into shape, now they've got you in line
Stand behind the stripes
That will be yours, so give it good mind

The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved

And by name
The name they gave me
The name I'm letting go

The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
Soon
