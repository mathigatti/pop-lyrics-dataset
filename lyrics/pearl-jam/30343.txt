Is there room enough for both of us?
Both of us apart?
Are we bound out of obligation?
Is that all we've got?
Get the words, and then I get to thinkin'
I don't wanna think, I wanna feel
How do I feel?
How do I?


If you're the only one, will I never be enough?
Hail, hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love

Swore I'd love you till the day I die, ah and beyond...
Are we going to the same place? If so, can I come?
It's egg rolling thick and heavy
All the past you carry
Oh, I could be new, you underestimate me

If you're the only one, will I never be enough?
Hail, hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love

Sometimes realize, I could only be as good as you'll let me
Are you woman enough to be my man?
Bandaged hand in hand

I find it on the run in a race that can't be won
All hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love, yeah
If you're my only one, so could you only one?
I want to be your one, enough...
Your one... Your one... Your one...
