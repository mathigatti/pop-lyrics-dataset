I feel your love, i feel your strong love
I feel the patience of unconditional love
I feel the strength, i feel your faith in me
I'll never let you down
No matter what you do
If you just walk with me
And let me walk with you
I'm on a journey
I don't wanna walk alone


Walk with me

Walk with me
Shine me a light
Walk with me
Walk with me

I lost some people i was traveling with
I missed a soul in the old friendship

Walk with me
