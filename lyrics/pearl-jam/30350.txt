Vacate is the word
Vengeance has no place so near to her
Cannot find the comfort in this world


Artificial tear
Vessel stabbed
Next up, volunteers?
Vulnerable
Wisdom can't adhere

A truant finds home
And a wish to hold on
But there's a trapdoor in the sun

Immortality

As privileged as a whore
Victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door

Holier than thou, how?
Surrendered, executed anyhow
Scrawl dissolved
Cigar box on the floor

A truant finds home
And a wish to hold onto
He saw the trapdoor in the sun

Immortality

I cannot stop the thought
I'm running in the dark
Coming up a which way sign
All good truants must decide

Oh, stripped and sold, mom
Auctioned forearm
And whiskers in the sink
Truants move on
Cannot stay long
Some die just to live
