And out isn't perfect
My friends,I'll say it too
Stay my case,of which I'm certain
I've lived a life as full
I've travelled each and every highway
Oh,and more,as more gets...
I did it my way


Regrets,I've had a few
But they're too few to mention
I did what I had
It's all through without exemption
I play each charted course
I've travelled each and every by-way
And more,much more than this...
I did it my way...

Well twice,I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
I knew it all,without a doubt
I ate it up and I had to spit it out
I passed it on,and I stood tall
And I did it my way
