Thought it was easy to fall in love but you, you, you
You're different this much I know yeah you, you, you
It might be your guile, it could be your mind
It might be the way you take your time
Oh, you, you, you


You, it's you, it's you you you
Oh you, it's you, it's you you you

I never know how much to say with you, you, you
I'd like to go deep but is it safe with you, you, you
It might be your needs, it could be your eyes
It might be the way you sympathize
Oh, you, you, you

You, it's you, it's you you you
Oh you, it's you, it's you you you

You break laws and pay no fines
You get yours and then get mine

I don't think it's easy to stay in love but you you you you
But you, yes you, it's you, you, you
You, it's you, it's you, you, you
Ah you, it's you, it's you, it's you
Ah you, you, you, it's you
