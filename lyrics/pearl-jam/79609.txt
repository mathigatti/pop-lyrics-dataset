Throw your arms around me (hunters and collectors)
I will come to you in the daytime
I will raise you from your sleep
I will kiss you in four places
As I go running down your street
I will squeeze the life right out of your
I will make you laugh, I'll make you cry
And you may never forget it
As I make you call my name as a shouter to the blue, summer sky
And we may never meet again
So shed your skin lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me (x2)


I will come to you at nightime
I will climb into your bed
I will kiss you in 155 places
As I go swimming around on your head
I will squeeze the life right out of your
I will make you laugh, I'll make you cry
And we may never forget it
As I make you call my name as a shouter to the blue, summer sky
And we may never meet again
So shed your skin lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me (x2)
Ohh yeah, uh huh, uh huh...
Ohh yeah, uh hum, ooh...
Ohh yeah, uh huh, uh huh...
Oh... And you will throw your arms around me...
