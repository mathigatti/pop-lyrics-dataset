Well she cried and she cried
All night to the sound of the freeway hum
And she swears she'll be gone
When the sun hits the ground
And she ain't coming back to my cell


Well she's tired and she's tired
Of this life she's been leading too long
And the time turns around
Through the walls that surround
To the chimes of a jailer's song

In my four walled world

Well she tries and she tries
But my feet just won't leave the ground
And I'm tired and I'm tired
Of this prisoner's life, and these chains
That drag me down

In my four walled world

And now the sun is low
And these walls try to break my soul
And now the moon is full
And I won't see nothing tonight
But the tears in her eyes and
My four walled world
