What the fuck is this world
Running to? You didn't
Leave a message at least I
Coulda' learned your voice one last time
Daily minefield this could
Be my time how 'bout you?
Would you hit me?
Would you hit me?


Ohhh, ohh ohh,
Ohhh woah oh.

All the bills go by and
Initiatives are taken up,
By the middle.
There ain't gonna be any middle any more.
And the cross I'm bearing home
Ain't indicative of my place
Left the porch
Left the porch

Hear my name
Take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand
Walk beside me
I just need to say...

Hear my name
Take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand
Lie beside me
I just need to say
What can I take?
I just want to be
I know that I would not ever
Touch you,
Hold you,
Feel you,
In my arms,
Never again.
