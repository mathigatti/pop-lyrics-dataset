I've used hammers made out of wood
I have played games with pieces and rules
I undeciphered tricks at the bar, but now you're gone
I haven't figured out why
I've come up with riddles and jokes about war
I figured out numbers and what they're for
I've understood feelings and I've understood words
But how could you be taken away?


And wherever you've gone and wherever we might go
It don't seem fair. Today just disappeared
Your light's reflected now. Reflected from apart
We were but stones. Your light made us stars

With heavy breath, awakened regrets
Back pages and days alone that could have been
spent together but we were miles apart
Every inch between us becomes light years now
No time to be void or save up on life
Oh, you got to spend it all

And wherever you've gone and wherever we might go
It don't seem fair. You seem to like it here
Your light's reflected now. Reflected from apart
We were but stones. Your light made us stars

And wherever you've gone and wherever we might go
It don't seem fair. Today just disappeared
Your light's reflected now. Reflected from apart
We were but stones. Your light made us stars
