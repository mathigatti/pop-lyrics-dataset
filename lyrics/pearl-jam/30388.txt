I've got you, and that's all I want.
I won't forget, 'cause that's a whole lot.
When something's wrong, I feel uneasy.
You show me, tell me you're not teasin'.


I don't know why sometimes I get frightened.
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying.

Look at you, you're a pageant.
You're everything that I've imagined.
I don't go out, now that you're here.
Sometimes we shout, but that's no problem.

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened.
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying.

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened.
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying.

There's no doubt, but when I'm with you.
When I'm without, I stay in my room.
Where do you go? I get no answer.
You're always out, it gets on my nerves...

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened.
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying.

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened.
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying.

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened.
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying.

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened.
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying.
