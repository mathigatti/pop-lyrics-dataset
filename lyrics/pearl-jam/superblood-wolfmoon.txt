Took her away too soon
Superblood Wolfmoon
Took her away too soon


I can hear you singin' in the distance
I can see you when I close my eyes
Once, you were somewhere and now you're everywhere
I'm feeling selfish and I want what's right

I ask for forgiveness
I beg of myself
Feelin' angry, knock it off the shelf

Right now I feel a lack of innocence
Searchin' for reveal, hypnotonic resonance
I feel not much of anything
And the cause is life or death

Turn around for hopelessness, focus on you focusness
I've been hopin' and all hope was lost
I don't know anything, I question everything
This life I love is going way too fast

Both my eyes are swollen, my face is broken
And I'm hopin' that I hurt ya
Hopin' that I hurt ya
Hopin' that I hurt ya
Fist

She was a stunner and I am stunned
And the first thought or second thought
Was It could be the one
I was a prisoner of keys and the cuffs
Yeah, I was feeling fortunate to be locked up

But the world got to spinnin'
Always felt like it was endin'
And love not withstandin'
We are each of us fucked!

I can hear you singin' in the distance
I can see you when I close my eyes
Once, you were somewhere and now you're everywhere
I'm feeling selfish and I want what's right

I ask for forgiveness
I beg of myself
Feelin' angry, knock it off the shelf
