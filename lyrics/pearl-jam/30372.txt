Know a man, his face seemed pulled and tense
Like he's riding, on a motorbike in the strongest winds
So I approach with tact, suggest that he should relax
But he's always moving much too fast


Said he'll see me on the flipside
On this trip he's taken for a ride
He's been taking too much on
There he goes with his perfectly unkept clothes
There he goes

He's yet to come back, but I've seen his picture
It doesn't look the same up on the rack
We go way back

And I wonder bout his insights
Its like his thoughts are too big for his size
He's been taken, where I don't know
Off he goes with his perfectly unkept hope
There he goes

And now I rub my eyes, for he has returned
Seems my preconceptions are what, should've been burned
For he still smiles, and he's still strong
Nothing's changed but the surrounding bullshit, that has grown

And now he's home, and we're laughing
Like we always did my same old, same old friend
Until a quarter to ten
I saw the strain creep in
He seems distracted and I know just what is going to happen next
Before his first step, He's off again
