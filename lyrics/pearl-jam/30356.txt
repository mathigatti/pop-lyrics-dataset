I will light the match this morning
So I won't be alone
Watch as she lies silent
For soon that will be gone
Oh, I will stand arms outstretched
Pretend I'm free to roam
Oh, I will make my way through
One more day in hell


How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?

I will hold the candle
Until it burns up my arm
Oh, I'll keep taking punches
Until their will grows tired
Oh, I will stare the sun down
Until my eyes go blind
Hey, I won't change direction
And I won't change my mind

How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?

I'll swallow poison
Until I grow immune
I will scream my lungs out
Till it fills this room

How much difference
How much difference
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
