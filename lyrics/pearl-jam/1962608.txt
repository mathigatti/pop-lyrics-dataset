Oh, what you say, what you say, what you gonna say when your life ends?
What you gonna say? Ole!
Ah, what you say, what you say, what can you say of importance?
What you gonna say but "Ole!"?
Ah, what you say, what you say when there's too much you can't breathe in?
What you gonna say but "Ole!"?


I ain't got words for what goes on
I ain't got words for all that's wrong
What do you say? Meditate
Meditate, Ole!

What you say when they give the guy the go-ahead?
What you gonna say? Ole!
What you say, what you say when your spitting up on your bed?
What you gonna say? Ole!
What you say, what you say when you've had enough of knuckleheads
What you gonna say? Ole!
What you say, now, what you say when you've seen enough bloodshed?
What you gonna say? Stop!

I still can't help but wonder why
I'm feeling laughed at by the sky
What do you say, meditate?
Meditate, Ole!

When your life ends
When your life ends
When your life ends
