One, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five, against one
Said one, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five, five, five, five against one


Torture from you to me
Abducted from the street
I'd rather be
I'd rather be with
I'd rather be with an animal

Why would you wanna hurt me?
So frightened of your pain
I'd rather be
I'd rather be with
I'd rather be with an animal
I'd rather be
I'd rather be
I'd rather be with an animal

I'd rather be
I'd rather be with
I'd rather be with an animal
I'd rather be
I'd rather be with
I'd rather be with an animal

Said one, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five, five, five, five against one
One, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five, five, five, five against one
