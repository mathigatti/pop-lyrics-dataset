I knew there was trouble, so I left detroit
I left my old man, for a plane full of boys
For did he leave me that son of a bitch keith
Yeah home after dawn
Always smelling like pig
He took my share and still didn’t care
Yeah, he probably would have
Killed me if I had stayed there
But I had a scheme so cool and so clean
I got me a ticket one way to moline


Moline, moline, how have you been?
Been here before, but it must have been a dream
Moline, you see, your rivers turn green
The mississippi rises as wide as the sea
Moline, it seems that this is for me
My name is nancy but here I’m coleen
Yeah, moline

Now I love paying ransom, life on my own
Yeah, everything’s better than in that bastard’s home
And someday I’ll buy, yeah look in I’ve been.
I got my eye in the quad cities, here in moline
The place with the chapel on 4th avenue and 12th street

Moline, moline, how have you been?
I probably been here before, but it must’ve been a dream
Moline, you see, your rivers turn green
The mississippi rises as wide as the sea
Moline, it seems that this is for me
You call me nancy and now I live in moline.
