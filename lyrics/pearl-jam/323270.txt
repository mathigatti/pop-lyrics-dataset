it's no shame that love's a game that 
i can only play with you
what i'm saying is i've been saving
my love for you
i've seen the light, i'm satisfied
that the brightest star is you
satellite, i'm holding tight
beaming back to you
days turn into, nights turn into, days turn into...today.. 
don't think about playing, cause i'm inside waiting
for you
i felt the light, i'm satisfied that
the highest star is you
satellite, i'm holding tight
beaming back to you
don't you worry, i believe your story
you were put away for something you didn't do
what i'm saying, is i'm saving
my love...
