On the rise and
Rise and fall
What they're sayin is
Nothin left at all


On the rise and
Catch and fall
All they're sayin is
Somethin that i don't like

Of the earth

On the rise and
Rise and fall
All they're sayin is
Comin back for more

On the rise and
Here-to-fore
On the scene is
Somethin i don't like

Of the earth

On the rise and
Rise and fall
All they're sayin is
Nothin i don't like

On the rise and
Rise and fall
All they're sayin is
Nothin i don't like

Of the earth
