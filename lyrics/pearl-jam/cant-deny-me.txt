And now you want me to breathe
And be so grateful
Ah, for the air that I need (haha)
Don't make me pitiful


And in the morning light
We're just the same, you and me
Out on the go, send officials
Our propensity to breed

The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
You may be rich, but you can't deny me
Got nothing, got nothing but the will to survive
You can't control, and you can't deny me

Your lies are sick
They're sick and they're vile
You can't deny me

Try and talk down to me
My mind, it ain't so simple
Where's your vocabulary?
Your ignorance is sinful

You plant your lying seeds
Watch as the roots take hold
The country you are now poisoning
Condition critical

The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
I know it's true, and you can't deny me
Got nothing, got nothing, you got nothing to hide
Little bullshit whore, and you can't deny me

The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
It's all so sick, and you can't deny me

You can't deny me
You can't deny me
You don't defy me
You can't deny me

The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
You know you're sick, and you can't deny me
Got nothing, just nothing, you got something to hide
We see right through you, and you can't deny me

Darkness, darkness, darkness and light
You can't deny me
