See it happen to a couple of friends
See it happen and the message it sends
Taking off for what's an obvious fall
Just to see what all the fuss is about


It's not your way, not your way
It's not your way, yeah

Another habit, sentence him up with you
Another habit, says he's long overdue
Another habit like an unwanted friend
I'm so happy with my righteous self

It's not your way, not your way
It's not your way

Never thought you'd habit
I never thought you, never thought you
Never thought you'd habit
I never thought you, never, never thought you

Never thought you'd habit

Speaking as a child of the nineties
Never thought you'd habit
I never thought you, never thought you
Never thought you'd habit
I never thought you, never, never thought you

Never, never me, never you, never me
