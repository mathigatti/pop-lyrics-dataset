Now all the Sundays seem so blue
Just to change a week it is to blame
Don't wanna open any wounds
I just want to laugh again


Don't feel the Christmas without you
All the lights have turned to gray
The rain upon the passing cars
Blurrs your smile

Was it worth it?
I was gone so long
You deserve this
Just give our love this try
Was it worth it in the long run?

All the sunshine of your smile
Has been turning in the mist
Of my eyes
Tell me, are you leaving
Feel all lies

Was it worth it?
I was gone so long
You deserve this
Just give our love this try

Was it worth it in the long run?
In the long run
In the long run
