When the kingdom comes
He puts his records on
And with his blistered thumb hits play
Now with the volume up
He goes and fills his cup
And lets the drummers drum take away


The pain
The pain
Breaking
Forsaken

What’s that you’re taken
Believing the feeling
He lets the records play
Should future dim
The cigarette light’s in
The vaporizer green light grim

And when the shot glass talks he goes to listens up
Until he’s nice and numb again
Again

Shaken
The breaking
Not one for faking
The reeling is healing

He lets the records play
There’s wisdom in his ways
I’ve been down and I fell so hard and far from grace
I’ve been hurt and I still recall the flaws on her face
I’ve been off but I'm on up upon my feet
My feet again

Shaken
Forsaken
What’s that you’re taking
The weeding
The feeling
He lets the records play

Shaken
But breaking
Not one for faking
The reeling is healing
He lets the records play
There’s wisdom in his ways
