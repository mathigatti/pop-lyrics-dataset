I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already over-filled


Yeah
But it's on the table
The fire is cooking
And they're farming babies
While the slaves are working

The blood is on the table
The mouths are choking
But I'm going hungry
Yeah

I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already over-filled
Oho, ah

But it's on the table
The fire is cooking
And they're farming babies
While the slaves are working

And it's on the table
The mouths are choking
But I'm going hungry(going  hungry)
I'm going hungry (going  hungry)
I'm going hungry (going  hungry)
