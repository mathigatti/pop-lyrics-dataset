Last stop on the west coast line
South of the northern border
One small corner on my mind


Everybody, they know me there
Don't get any second glances
Chances are that they don't care

The world has come undone
Like to change it everyday
Change don't come at once
It's a wave
Building before it breaks

Can't wait for election day
Witness the occupation
Corporations rule the day
Well you know the pendulum throws
Farther out to the one side, swinging
Has to sweep back the other way

The world has come undone
Another day and who can wait
Change don't come at once
It's a wave
Building before it breaks

All this hope and nowhere to go
This is how I used to feel, but no more
The world has come undone
Like a game that few can play
Change don't come from one
It's a wave
Building before it breaks
