She lived on the curve of the road
In an old, tar-paper shack
On the south side of the town
On the wrong side of the tracks


Sometimes on the way into town we'd say
Mama, can we stop and give her a ride?
Sometimes we did
But her hands flew from her side
Wild eyed, crazy Mary

Down a long dirt road, past the Parson's place
That old blue car we used to race
Little country store
With a sign tacked to the side
Said: No L-O-I-T-E-A-R-R-I-N-G Allowed

Underneath that sign
Always congregated quite a crowd
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it 
Pass it a, pass it around

One night thunder cracked
Mercy backed outside her window sill
Dreamed I was flying high above the trees
Over the hills
Looked down into the house of Mary
Bare bulb hung, newspaper-covered walls
And Mary rising above it all
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Next morning on the way into town
Saw some skid marks and followed them around
Over the curve, through the fields
Into the house of Mary

That what you fear the most
Could meet you halfway
That what you fear the most
Could meet you halfway

Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down pass it, pass it around (pass it around)
Take a bottle drink it down pass it, pass it a, pass it around
Pass it a, pass it around 
(Take a bottle drink it down pass it, pass it around) oh yeah
Pass it
(Around) pass it
Pass it, pass it (around, around, around)
Around
Around, around
Pass it around
