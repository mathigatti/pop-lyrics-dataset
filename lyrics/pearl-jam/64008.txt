Have a drink they're buying.
Bottom of bottle of denial.


Big guy. Big eye watching me.
Have to wonder what it sees. ???.
Progress laced with ramifications.
Freedom's big blur. Oh.

Pull the innocent from a crowd.
Raise those sticks them bring them down.
If they fail to obey.
Ah, if they fail to obey. Yeah yeah.

For every tool they lend us a loss of independence.

I pledge my grievance to the flag.
Cause you don't give blood then take it back again.
Oh we're all deserving something more.

Progress taste it invest it all.
Champagne breakfast for everyone. Everyone.

Break the innocent when they're proud.
Raise those stakes then bring them down.
If they fail to obey.
Yeah, ha, if they fail to obey.

Pledge your grievance to the flag.
Cause, don't give blood then take it back again.
Oh, we're all deserving something more.

Have a, have a drink, drink. Have a, have a drink, drink.

I want to breathe part of the scene.
I want to taste everyone I see.
I want to run when I'm up high.
I want to run to the sea.
I want to life to be.
I just want to be.
I will feel alive as long as I am free
