Alone, listless
Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl, violence
Center of her own attention
Mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud
The shades go down, it's in her head
Painted room, can't deny there's something wrong


Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me

She holds the hand that holds her down
She will rise above

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to me
The picture kept will remind me

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to me
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me

The shades go down
The shades go down
The shades go, go, go
