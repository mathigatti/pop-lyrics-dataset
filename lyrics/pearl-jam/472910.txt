The sun was in clouds. The sun looked out. Exposed a trail of
mist and spouts.
Ships followed the ancient lead. Deceiving friends under the
sea.
Wow, imagine that? They won't fight back. I got a theory on
that.
A whale's heart is as big as a car. A whaler's thought must be
smudged by the dark.


They won't fight back. I'm sure they know how. Means they love
or are too proud.
They won't fight back. I'm sure they know how. Means they love

They swim. It's really free. It's a beautiful thing to see. They
sing.

Hunters of land. Hunters of sea. Exploit anything for money.
I refer to anybody that takes advantage of what that is free.
They won't fight back.
It's only a thought that makes it seem right. What you don't see
is because of your sight.

Take what you want. Kill what you can. That's just one way of
the mind of man.
Take their lives. Sell their parts but there is not taking of
their hearts.

If I was lost at sea. That harpoon boat in front of me. It's the
whale I'd like to be.

They won't fight back. (x5)
They don't know how.
