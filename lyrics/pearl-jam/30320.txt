Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world


We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires, the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pourin’ down
There were people standing all around
Something warm flowing through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
Hold me darlin’ just a little while
I held her close I kissed her - our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I had miss
Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life, that night

Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
