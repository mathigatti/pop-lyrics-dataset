Some people seem so obsessed with the morning
Get up early just to watch the sunrise
Others peolpe like it more when there's fire in the sky
Worship the sun when it's high
Some people go for those sultry evenings
Cocktails in the blue, red, and grey
But I like every minute of the day
I dig every second So long as you are on my mind
Each precious moment has its special charm
It's all right when you're around, rain or shine
I know a crowd who only lives after midnight
Their faces always seem so pale
And then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight
They say a suntan never fails
I know I was a man who worked a night shift
I was lucky to get a job and some pay
Now I like every minute of the day
I dig every second I could laugh in the snow and rain
I get a buzz from being cold and wet
The pleasure seems to balance out the pain
And so you see that I'm completely crazy
I even shun the south of France
The people on my hill they say I'm lazy
But when they sing I...uh
But when they sleep I sing and dance
I know a crowd who...or something
Cocktails in the blue, red and grey
But I like every minute of the day
I like every minute of the day...
