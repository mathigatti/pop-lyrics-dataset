Keep on locking your doors
Keep on building your floors
Keep on just as before


Pay disasters no mind
Didn't get you this time
No prints left at the crime

Our ship's come in
And its sinking

Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of men

Somehow it is the biggest things
That keep on slipping
Right through our hands

By thinking we're infallible
We are tempting fate instead

Time we best begin
Here at the ending

Wanna third second chance
Put your faith in big hands
Pay no more than a glance

All good things come to an end
This could be good as it gets
How's the view from the fence?

You think we been here before
You are mistaken

Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of men

When progress could be plausible
In reverse we curse ourselves

By thinking we're infallible
We are tempting fate instead

Time we best begin
Here at the ending

Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of men

Somehow it is the biggest things
That keep on slipping
Right through our hands

By thinking we're infallible
We are tempting fate instead

Time we best begin
Here at the ending

Keep on locking your doors
Keep on building your floors
Keep on just as before
