I wanna shake, I wanna wind out
I wanna leave this mind and shout
I've lived all this life
Like an ocean in disguise
I don't live forever
You can't keep me here


I wanna race with the sundown
I want a last breath that I don't let out
Forgive every being
The bad feelings, it's just me
I won't wait for answers
You can't keep me here

I wanna rise and say a-goodnight
I wanna take a look on the other side
I've lived all these lives
It's been wonderful at night
I will live forever
You can't keep me here
