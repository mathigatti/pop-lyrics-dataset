Troubled souls unite
We got ourselves tonight
I am fuel, you are friends, we got the means to make amends
I am lost, I'm no guide, but I'm by your side
I am right by your side


Young lover I stand
It was their idea, I proved to be a man
Take my fucking hand
It was their idea, I proved to be a man
Will myself to find a home, a home within myself
We will find a way, we will find our place

Drop the leash, drop the leash
Get outta' my fuckin' face

Drop the leash, we are young
Oh, get outta' my fuckin' face
Drop the leash, drop the leash
Get outta' my, my

Delight, delight, delight in our youth, oww
Get outta' my fuckin' face
