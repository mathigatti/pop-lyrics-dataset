Wooden Jesus where are you from?
Korea or Canada, mayeb Taiwan?
I didn't know it was the holy land.
But I believed from the minute the check left my hand
And I pray.
Can I be saved, I spent all my money
On a future grave
Wooden Jesus I'll cut you in on twenty percent of my future sin
Porcelain Mary her majesties pure
Looking for virgin territory
Coat hanger halos don't come cheap
From television shepheds with living room sheep,
And I pray.
Can I be saved,I spent all my money on a future grave
Wooden Jesus I'll cut you in on twenty percent of my future sin.
