Ooo my little pretty one, pretty one
when you gonna give me some time Sharona
ohh you make my motor run, motor run,
gun it coming off of the line Sharona


Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind
Always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My My My Sharona

Come a little closer huh be a hon
Close enough to look in my eyes Sharona
Keep a little mystery get to me
Running down the length of my thigh Sharona

Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind
Always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My My My Sharona

When you gonna get to me get to me
Is it just a matter of time Sharona?
Here's a trip to destiny to destiny
Or is it just a game in my mind Sharona?

Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind
Always get it up from the touch of the younger kind
My My My Sharona

oooooooo My Sharona
