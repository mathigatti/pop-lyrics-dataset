Can't know what's high
'Till you been down so low


The future's bright
Lit up with no where to go

To and fro the pendulum throws

We are here and then we go
My shadow left me long ago

Understand what we don't know
This might pass, this might last, this may grow

Easy come easy go
Easy left me a long time ago

I'm in the fire, but I'm still cold
Nothing works, works for me anymore

To and fro the pendulum throws
To and fro the pendulum throws

To and fro
To and fro
