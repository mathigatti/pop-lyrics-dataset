Pirates,I'm sayin' they rob I
Board the merchant ships
I'm not sayin' we're not a part of it
From the bottomless pit
But my hands were made strong
By the force of the Almighty
They don't say that your generation,triumphantly


Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever had
Redemption song

Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our mind
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time

How long can they steal our prophets
While we stand beside and look?
They don't say I'm your generation
Oh,and I say...

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever had
Redemption song (x2)

Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our mind
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time

How long can they steal our prophets
While we stand beside and look?
Say some say it's just a part of it
You got to fulfill the book...

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever had
Redemption song
'Cause all I ever had
Redemption song (X2)
This song of freedom
Oh...
