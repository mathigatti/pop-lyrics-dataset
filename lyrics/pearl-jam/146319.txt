Don't give me no lip, i've had my fill of it
Don't give me no lip, i've lost my taste for it
Don't give me no lip, you've got to face this shit
Don't give me no lip, Don't give me no lip

Don't give me no lip
Don't give me no lip
Don't give me no

Don't give me no lip, I'm just not having it
Don't give me no lip, suck on your cigerette
Don't give me no lip, I'm wiping off the spit
Don't give me no lip, Don't give me no lip

It's just a problem
One I'll be solving
It's just a problem

Don't give me no lip
Don't give me no lip
Don't give me no
