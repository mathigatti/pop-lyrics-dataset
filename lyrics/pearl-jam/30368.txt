Lay down your arms and surrender to me
Oh, lay down your arms and love me peacefully, yeah
Use your arms for squeezin' and pleasing
The one who loves you so


Oh, there ain't no reason for you to declare
War on the one who loves you so
So forget the other boys, 'cause my love is real
Come off your battlefield

Lay down your arms and surrender to me, yeah
Lay down your arms and love me peacefully, yeah
Use your arms for squeezin' and pleasing
That's the way it's gotta be

The weapons you're using are hurting me bad
But someday you're going to retreat
'Cause my love, baby, is the truest you've ever had
I'm a soldier of love, that's hard to beat

Lay down your arms and surrender to me
Lay down your arms and love me peacefully, yeah
Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't wanna fight no more

Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't wanna fight no more

Oh, baby, lay down your arms
Oh, baby, lay down your arms
Oh, baby, lay down your arms
Oh, baby, lay down your arms
Oh, baby, lay down your arms
Oh, baby, lay down your arms
Oh, baby, lay down your arms

Please, baby, lay down your arms
