Every beach has a clown who thinks he knows it all. 
Hang-ten outta Santa Fe when surf comes out tomorrow lets go! 
And he's always practicing his cowabunga call. 
Cowabunga! 
But the menace scrambles when the big waves start to roll. 
Wsssshhhh... 
'Cuse there's nothing worse then a gremmie out of control. 
Gremmie out of control. (x2) 
There's nothing worse then a gremmie out of control. 
The kids all know that a gremmie's talk is cheep. 
Ride the Hula-Han over the pipeline bonsai to the saddle bowl. 
Tho they just try to ignore this ugly creep. 
Cowabunga! 
His board is always full of dings 'cause he's always doing stupid things. 
And there's nothing worse then a gremmie out of control. 
Gremmie out of control. (x2) 
There's nothing worse then a gremmie out of control. 
Gremmie out of control. (x2) 
There's nothing worse then a gremmie out of control. (x3)
