The mind is grey like the city
Packing in and overgrown
Love is deep, dig it out
Standing in a hole alone
Working for something that we can never hold
A place in the clouds
Your place to hide oh my oh


So, I'm flying away, away
I'm driving away, away

Finding, hoping ways I miss before
I miss before

The TV, she talks to me
Breaking news and building walls
Selling me, what I don't need
Didn't know soap made you taller

So I'm flying away, away
Driving away, away

So much talk it makes no sense at all
My senses have gone

So I'm flying away, away
Driving away, away

Passing new friends I won't know at all

It doesn't hurt when I bleed
But memories they eat me
I've seen it all before
Bring it on, cause I'm no victim

Dying
Dying
