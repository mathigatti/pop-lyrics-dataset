Don't even think about reachin' me
I won't be home
Don't even think about stoppin' by
Don't think of me at all


I did a what I had to do
If there was a reason, it was you

Ah, don't even think about gettin' inside
Voices in my head
Ooh, voices

I got scratches, all over my arms
One for each day, since I fell apart

I did a what I had to do
If there was a reason, it was you

Footsteps in the hall
It was you, you
Pictures on my chest
It was you, it was you

I did a what I had to do
And if there was a reason
Oh, there wasn't no reason, no

And if, there's something you'd like to do
Just let me continue to blame you

Footsteps in the hall
It was you, you
Pictures on my chest
It was you, you
