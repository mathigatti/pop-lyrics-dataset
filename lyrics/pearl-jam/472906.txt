I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
I want all the world to see we've met
Da,da,da,da-da,da...


Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
Adn I'd have never been aware
As it is I'll dream of her tonight
Da,da,da,da-da,da...

Oh,yeah,yes I'm fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
