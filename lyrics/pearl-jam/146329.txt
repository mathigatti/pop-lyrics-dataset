There's colors on the street, red, white and blue
People shufflin' their feet, people sleepin' in their shoes
But there's a warnin' sign on the road ahead
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
Don't feel like Satan but I'm to them
So I try to forget it anyway I can


Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

I see a woman in the night with a baby in her hand
Under an old street light near a garbage can
Now, she's put the kid away and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what she's done to it
That's one more kid that'll never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

We got a thousand points of light for the homeless man
We got a kindler, gentler, machine gun hand
We've got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam garbage for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
