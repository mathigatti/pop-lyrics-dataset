Sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a corvette
Thinks he'll get the girl he'll only get the mechanic
What's missing? He's living a day he'll soon forget


That's one more time around
The sun is going down
The moon is out but he's drunk and shouting
Putting people down
He's pissing
He's living a day he'll soon forget

Counts his money every morning
The only thing that keeps him horny
Locked in a giant house that's alarming
The townsfolk they all laugh

Sorry is the fool who trades his love for hi-rise rent
Seems the more you make equals the loneliness you get
And it's fitting. He's barely living a day he'll soon forget

That's one more time around and there is not a sound
He's lying dead clutching Benjamins
Never put the money down
He's stiffening
We're all whistling a man we'll soon forget
