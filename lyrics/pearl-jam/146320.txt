I'm questioning my education 
Is my education no i'm not 
While you're deciding i've been finding 
Looking around in the here and now 


If I'd been taught from the beginning
Would my fears be winning now? 

I'm questioning my own equation 
Is my own equation relevant somehow 
The flags will wave and the news is breaking 
See the man who came, forgot his own tie 

If I'd been taught from the beginning
Would my fears be winning now? 
A wild world, figured out the answers 
I'll be in my own, dancing out, ou-out yeaaah 

I'm questioning my education 
Rewinding, what does it show? 
Could be, the truth, it becomes you
