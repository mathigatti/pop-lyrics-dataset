Shaft of a light, a warm breath and a scream
Ah, yeah
Oh, tamper if you like between the doors
Oh yeah, huh, huh
Oh, can't expect to go out
To go out with anything, anything more


Oh, reach the door
A breath and a
Oh, reach the door and a la la la la, yeah
Life ain't what it's worth
A breath and a

All these reaching hands out grabbing things (grabbing me)
Day in day out accumulating, ah yeah
Whoa, I suggest you step out on your porch
Oh yeah, huh, huh, huh huh, yeah

Oh, reach the door a breath and a
Oh, reach the door
Oh, and a la la la la, yeah
Life ain't what it's worth

Come (here it comes)
There it goes (when it comes)
Where it goes (where it comes)
Can't see through the faith, woah

Grasp what you can
Don't you know there's something inside your head, yeah

Oh, if I knew where it was
I would take you there but
There's much more than this
Oh, whoa, much more than this
Oh see the world, much more than
Oh, much more than, why?
