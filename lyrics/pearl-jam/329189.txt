Was raised up
In a bad way
With ugly little things
That are here to stay
Well I'm a man now
In charge of what I think


Those little bits of ugliness
Will drive me to drink
Formal education
I thought my teachers told the truth
Yeah but mom and dad and mrs. Smith
Well they lied to this poor youth

But we're bright children
Oh oh ho oh
Let's shake some sense into them
What the funk is up
Shake some sense into them
What the funk is up
Shake it...shake shake...shake it

What the funk is up
Shake some sense into them
What the funk is up...uh
I see things so much better now
I think I found the missing link
You've got to jump back from those people
Who would poison what you think

We're bright children
Oh oh ho oh
Let's shake some sense into them
What the funk is up
Shake some sense into them
What the funk is up
What the funk...what the funk
What the funk is up
Shake some sense into them
What the funk is up...ah

We're bright children
Oh oh ho oh
Let's shake some sense into them
What the funk is up
Shake some sense into them
What the funk is up
What the funk...what the funk...what the funk
What the funk is up
Shake some sense into them
What the funk is up

We're bright children
Oh oh ho oh
Let's shake some sense into them
What the funk is up
Shake some sense into them
What the funk is up
What the funk...what the funk...what the funk...what the funk
What the funk is up
Shake some sense into them
What the funk is up
