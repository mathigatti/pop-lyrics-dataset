He's got a big gold ring which says "Jesus saves"
And it's dented from the punch thrown at work that day
Where he smashed the metal locker where he kept his things
After the big boss said you'd best be on your way


Oh yeah...
So this life is sacrifice
Oh yeah...
Jumping trains just to survive

Well, his wife and kids are sleeping but he's still awake
On his brain weighs the curse of thirty bills unpaid
Gets up, lights a cigarette he's grown to hate
Thinkin if he can't sleep, how will he ever dream?

Yeah...
So this life is sacrifice
Oh yeah...
To a stranger's bottom line

Yeah...
I seen the light... Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
I's scared alive

Yeah...
I seen the light... Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
Scared alive

Yeah...
So this life is sacrifice
Oh yeah...
The can't say I never tried

Oh yeah...
I seen the light... Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
I's scared alive

Near to death... Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
I've seen the light

Scared alive Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohhhhhh Ohhh..
Near to death

Here to die
Scared alive

Near to death
Here to die
Scared alive
