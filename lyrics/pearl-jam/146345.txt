I don't mind all the guys dancing with my girl
That's fine,I know them all pretty well
And I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright...
The kids are alright...


Sometimes,I know I gotta get away
Bells chime,I know I gotta get away
And I know if I don't,I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright...
The kids are alright...

I know if I go things would be a lot better for her
I had this plan but her folks wouldn't let her

I don't mind,I feel I gotta get away
Bells chime,I know I gotta get away
And I know if I don't I'll go out of my fuckin' mind
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright...
