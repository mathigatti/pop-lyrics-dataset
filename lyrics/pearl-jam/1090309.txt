People like you, I know myself
Walk in the shoes of somebody else
Whisper to me, my tragic fate
Whisper to me, my tragic end
But don't give me your savior


People I choose, life on my own
Burn me your fuse, throw me your stones
Give me your brand, burn on my hand
Whisper to me, my tragic end
But don't give me your savior

People I choose, I know myself
Lay my need out, give you my help
But you give me your blues
And you whisper my fate
But don't give me your savior
