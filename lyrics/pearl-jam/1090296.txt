You call me a dog well that's fair enough
Cause it ain't no use to pretend
You're wrong
When you call me out I can't hide anymore
I have no disguise you can't see through


Well you say it's bad luck
To have fallen for me
Well what can I say to make it good for you
You wore me out like an old winter coat
Trying to be safe from the cold

But when it's my time to throw
The next stone
I'll call you beautiful if I call at all

You tell me I'm low 'cause I've slept on the floor
And out in the woods with the badgers and wolves
You threw me out 'cause I went digging for gold
And I came home with a handful of coal

But when it's my time to throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful if I call at all

And when it's time to call your bluff
I'll call you beautiful or leave it alone

You call me a dog
Well that's fair enough
It doesn't bother me as long as you know
Bad luck will follow you
If you keep me on a leash and
You drag me along
