On the edge, windowsill
Ponders his maker, ponders his will
To the street below, he just aint nothin
But hes got a great view, and he sinks the needle deep, yeah
Whoa, cant touch the bottom
In too deep, yeah, oh, cant touch the bottom


Oh, on the edge of a know-nothin town
Feelin quite superior, the aged come
To the sky above he just aint nothin
But hes got a great view, and he sinks a burning knife deep, yeah
Ooh, cant touch the bottom
In too deep, yeah, uh huh, cant touch the bottom
In too deep, ohhh, ohhh

Ow, on the edge of a Christmas clean love
Young virgin from heaven visiting hell
To the man above her, she just ain't nothin
And she doesn't like the view
She doesn't like the view
But he sinks himself deep

Oh, cant touch the bottom
In too deep, yeah, oh, cant touch the bottom
Cant touch the bottom
Deep, yeah
Oh, yeah, the bottom, yeah
Ohh
