my number's up, my time has come
sounds like they're playin' my song 
on the altar, my picture... 
will be there while i'm gone 
there'll be time for laughin' 
there's no time to cry 
soon i will be leavin' 
look me in the eye 
no matter what's in front of me 
it's your face that i'll see 
and the future of our young ones 
yeah this is what fuels me 
there's no time for laughin' 
there's no time to cry 
soon i will be leavin' 
look me in the eye 
the oath i took not so seriously 
the world's gathered steam and caught up with me 
and my decision's been made, from some other place 
by someone i don't know and they don't know me 
this is no time for laughin' 
there's no time to cry 
soon i will be leavin' 
look me in the eye
