How good is he? How warm are his eyes?
You see, it's not a reprise
Did he arrive too late and too tethered away
To put on his suit and his tie?


How good is he? How warm is his heart or ego, telling him which place to park?
Did he relate? The message is clearly, hardly grounds for dismissal
Outright, grounds for dismissal outright

I wake up and wait up
When anger's in fashion
I wake up and wait up
It echoes through the mansions
I wake up and wait up
When april's in may, oh, uh-oh
I wake up and wait up
The answers are fatal
The answers are fatal

I wake up and wait up
The answers are fatal
If he's truly out of sight, is he truly out of mind?
If he's truly out of sight
