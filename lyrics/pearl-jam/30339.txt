Drifting
Drifting
Drifting away
I got myself a mansion
And I gave it away
It's not the world that's heavy
It's just the things that you save
But I'm driftin
Drifting away


Drifting
Drifting
Drifting along
I read myself the worries
And the worries were gone
I can run when I want to
And I sleep like a dog
I'm just driftin
Drifting along

The suit-coats say
There is money to be made
They get so damn excited
But I guess it's their way
My road it may be lonely
Just because it's not paved
It's good for driftin
Drifting away

Aw the suit-coats say
There is money to be made
They get so damn excited
Nothing gets in their way
My road it may be lonely
Just because it's not paved
It's good for driftin
Drifting away

Drifting
Drifting
Drifting uh-huh
I feel like going back there
But never for long
I sometimes wonder if they know that IÃ‚'m gone
I'm just driftin
Drifting along

Drifting
Drifting along

Drifting
Drifting
