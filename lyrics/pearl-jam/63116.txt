The selfish, they're all standing in line
Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time
Me, I figure as each breath goes by
I only own my mind


The north is to south what the clock is to time
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that I'll die
The in between is mine
I am mine

And the meanings, it get left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
Significant, between the lines
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight

The ocean is full 'cause everyone's crying
The full Moon is looking for friends at hightide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mind
I am mine

And the meaning, it gets left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
Significant, between the lines
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight

And the meaning, it gets left behind
All the innocence broken with lies
We're all different behind the eyes
We may need to hide

And the meanings that get left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
Significance, between the lines
There's no need to hide
