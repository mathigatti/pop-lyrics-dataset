Do you want to hear something sick?
We are but victims of desire
I'm gonna shake this thing
I wanna shake this pain before I retire


I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything, I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away

Buona sera, won't be long before we
All walk off the wire
Well I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend
For what I require

Buona sera I will come in quick
Don't want my flame to get no higher

I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything, I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away

Wanna leave it all
Wanna give it up
Wanna see it, gone once and for all

Wanna feel withdrawal
Want an overhaul
Want to be there, hard as a statue
Black as a tattoo
Never to wash away...

Gonna take me an astral plane
I'm gonna tunnel through denial
I'm gonna shake this thing
I wanna shake this pain before I retire

I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything, I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
