There's a girl on aledge, she's got nowhere to turn
Cause all the love that she had was just wood that she burned
Now her life is on fire, it's no one's concern
She can blame the world, or prey til dawn
But only love can breakerfall
Breakerfall
Only love can breakerfall
Fall


It's like she lost her invitation to the party on earth
And she's standing outside hating everyone here
She's her own disease, crying to her doll
But only love can breakerfall
Breakerfall
Only love can breakerfall
Yeah

Fall, breakerfall
Can breakerfall
Ooh yeah, only love can breakerfall
Love, love, can breakerfall, fall
Love, love, can breakerfall
Only love can breakerfall
