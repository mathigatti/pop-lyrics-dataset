Everyday, seems a little closer
Going faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will truly come my way
Everyday, it's a gettin' faster
Everyone says go on up and ask her
Love like yours will truly come my way
Everyday seems a little longer
Every way, love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me?
Everyday, it's a gettin' faster
Everyone says go on up and ask her
Love like yours truly mw way
Everyday seems a little longer
Everywhere, love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me?
Everyday, seems a little closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will truly come my way
Love like yours will truly come my way
Love like yours will truly come my way
