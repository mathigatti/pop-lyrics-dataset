Don't feel like home
He's a little out
And all these words elope
It's nothing like your poem


Putting in, inputting in
Don't feel like methadone
A scratching voice all alone
It's nothing like your baritone

It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs, it's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes, it's home

One uninvited chromosome
A blanket like the ozone

It's nothing as it seems
All that he needs, it's home
The little that he frees
Is nothing he believes

Saving up a sunny day
Something maybe two tone
Anything of his own
A chip off the corner stone
Who's kidding, rainy day
One way ticket headstone
Occupations overthrown
A whisper through a megaphone

It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs, it's home
The little that he sees, is nothing
He concedes it's home

And all that he frees
A little bittersweet, it's home
It's nothing as it seems
The little that you see, its home
