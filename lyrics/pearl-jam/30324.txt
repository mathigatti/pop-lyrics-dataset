At home, drawing pictures of mountain tops
With him on top, lemon yellow Sun
Arms raised in a V
The dead lay in pools of maroon below


Daddy didn't give attention
To the fact that mommy didn't care
King Jeremy, the wicked
Oh, ruled his world

Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Clearly I remember picking on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
Oh, but we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast, how could I forget?

And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurting, oh, dropped wide open
Just like the day
Oh, like the day I heard

Daddy didn't give affection, no
And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy, the wicked
Oh, ruled his world

Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Try to forget this (try to forget this)
Try to erase this (try to erase this)
From the blackboard

Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today

(Spoke in, spoke in, spoke in)
(Spoke in, spoke in, spoke in)
(Spoke in, spoke in, spoke in)
