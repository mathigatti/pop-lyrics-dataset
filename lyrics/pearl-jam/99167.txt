Olympic dream, olympic dream... 
if i could reach to the sky and touch it for my country 
get some on my finger and take in its smell 
the smell of victory, land of the free, olympic dream, olympic
dream 
olympic theme 
my olympic dream 
my promotion scheme 
how hard can it be 
how high can i jump 
how high can i throw 
how high can i run (i'm running very fast) 
how long can i hold my breath and stay underwater 
and wave my legs around in perfect unison with my partner who
doesn't really understand me 
for my olympic dream, my olympic dream 
i'll be like dwight stone 
i'll be like bruce jenner 
i'll be like that girl who trained all her life as a distance
runner and then tripped with a quarter mile to go 
but i...i will get up and i will run 
i will run with the georgia peach breeze and i...i will win 
i will win my...my olympic dream 
my olympic dream 
the gold's just not good enough 
and i don't even think of the bronze 
i'm living my life for olympic platinum 
olympic dream, my olympic theme 
i'll sing like whitney (sing like whitney)
