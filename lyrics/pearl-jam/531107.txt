I used to be crustacean 
In an underwater nation 
And I surf in celebration 
Of a billion adaptations 


Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave 
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave 

I feel the need 
planted in me 
Millions of years ago 
Can't you see 
the oceans size? 
Defining time 
and tide 
arising 
Arms laid upon me 
Being so kind 
To let me ride 

I scream in affirmation 
Of connecting dislocations 
And exceeding limitation 
By achieving levitation 

Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave. 
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave. 

I feel the need 
planted in me 
Millions of years ago 
Can't you see 
the oceans size? 
Defining time 
and tide 
arising 
Arms laid upon me 
Being so kind 
To let me ride 

Got me a ride 
I got me a ride
