Every photograph is peeling 
the colors turn to gray, this day 
there is always memories for days, these days 
an undertow of futures laid to waste, embraced 
by the loss of one he could not replace 


and there's no reason that she'd pass 
and there is no god with the plan, it's sad 
and his holiness is proof, it's said 
he could only know how you have sinned 

the world swings through a passing fable 
a fate we made a way, we say 
holding on, live within our own ways 
he lit a match, he laid in bed 
hoping their dreams will bring her back, it's sad 
and his holiness is proof, they said 
he could only love you, it's said 

oh in his last breath, believing 
he'll make his way 
if she's not forgotten 
he's haunted 
he's searching for escape 

if just one wish could bring her back, it's sent 
and his holiness is proof, it's said
