Bee girl, you're gonna die
You don't wanna be famous, you wanna be shy
Do your dances alone in your room
Becoming a star will become your doom
Bee girl, be a girl


You know time is long, and life is short
Begin to live while you still can
Believe in nothing, believe me
Those who can be trusted can change their mind
When the anxious is the present, unwrap your gifts, take your time
Everything you imagine needn't be stuck in your mind
Bee girl, be a girl
