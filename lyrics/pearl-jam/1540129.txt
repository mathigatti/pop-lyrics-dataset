Yeah yeah
Yeah I've been dreaming a getting along
Now I'm awake dreaming
Keepin' on keepin' on
I catch a break
Then a punch to the head
I smile back with a toothless grin yeah


Supersonic going into my soul
I caught the rhythm but the gut was slow yeah
Supersonic to be told
I don't need you to live
Never let you go yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Yeah I've been thinking
I already know
Nothing but nothing else so I have been told yeah
I'm not the paper
More like a fold
I cut the crease
Put the shit in the hole yeah

Supersonic going into my soul
I caught the rhythm but the gut was slow yeah
Supersonic to be told
I don't need you to live
Never let you go yeah yeah

Supersonic gonna feel it now
I need to hear it
Need to feel it loud yeah
Supersonic to be told
I want to live my life with the volume full

Supersonic gonna take my soul
I stop the rhythm but my gut was full yeah
Supersonic to be told
I don't need to you to live
Never let you go yeah yeah

Supersonic gonna feel it now
I need to hear it
Need to feel it loud yeah
Supersonic to be told
I want to live my life with the volume full yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
