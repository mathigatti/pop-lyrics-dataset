I should have known there was someone else
Down below I always kept it to myself
Now I believe in nothing
Not today as I move myself out of your sight
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight


I could never go to no one else
The hurt don't show but who knows, time will tell
I believe in nothing
But the pain that I can't see this turning out right
Oh, I'll be sleeping by myself tonight

Forever be sad and lonely
Forever never be the same
Well I close my eyes and wait for a sign
Am I just waiting in vain?

Well, I close my eyes and wait for a sign
Am I just waiting in vain?

Wooah I believe in love and disaster
Sometimes the two are just the same
I'm beginning to see what's left of me
Is gonna have to be free to survive

Oh, I'll be sleeping by myself tonight

I believe in nothing
But the pain that I can't see this turning out right

Oh, I'll be sleeping by myself
I'll be sleeping by myself
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight
