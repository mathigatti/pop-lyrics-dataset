and out isn't perfect 
my friends i'll say it to 
state my case of which i'm certain 
i've lived a life as full 
i've traveled at every highway 
oh and more as more gets 
i did it my way 
regrets i've had a few 
but they're too few to mention 
i did what i had 
it's all through without exemption 
i play each charted course 
i've traveled each and every byway 
and more much more than this 
i did it my way 
well twice i'm sure you knew 
when i bit off more than i could chew 
i knew it all without a doubt 
i ate it up and i had to spit it out 
i passed it on and i stood tall 
and did it my way 
i took a look, i took a blow
