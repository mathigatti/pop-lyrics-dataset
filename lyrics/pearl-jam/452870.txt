How can you say that you're not responsible
What does it have to do with me
What is my reaction, what should it be
Confronted by this latest atrocity


To tears...
Driven to tears (3x)
Oh yeah...

Hide my face in my hands, shame wells in my throat
A comfortable existence is reduced to a shallow, meaningless party
Seems that when some innocent die
All we can offer them is a page in a fuckin' magazine
Too many cameras and not enough food, and this is what we've seen

Driven to tears (3x)
Oh yeah...

Ohh... (4x)

Protest is futile, nothing seems to get through
What's to become of our world, and who know's what to do

Driven to tears (6x)
