Portugal, portugal
Here I surf a sea of people
Oh, theyÂ´re so warm
Like seattle with no needle
Oh here in portugal


Portugal portugal
We have already many friends from here
Makes us feel like home
Oh since the first time that we landed
Here in portugal
Portugal portugal

And now it?s coming to the end
And I don?t wanna to go
Oh if you let me I?ll move here
And live in portugal
Portugal portugal
