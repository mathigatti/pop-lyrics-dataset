I want for to lay down, i'm waiting 'till sundown 
i'm searching the haystacks, water is sunshine, wait for themoment 
the moment between us, the fire is made now, hot to the touch 
i wanted to get right 
i wanted to get right 
i wanted to get right with you
bakers dozen parades, stand and debate 
out single file, nine in a row, swear if you must 
keeping your boots on, float with the now, hot to the touch 
concrete underground, cast out everyday, the dregs of society 
underbelly, inside of me, rejoice and follow thee 
i wanted to get right 
i wanted to get right 
i wanted to get right with it, with you 
with... you...
yeah
i wanted to get right
i wanted to get right
i wanted to get right
...
