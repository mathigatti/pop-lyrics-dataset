Sliding out of reverse into drive, this
Wheel will be turning right, then straight
Off in the sunset she'll ride
She can remember a time denied, stood by
Side of the road, spilled like wine, now
She's out on her own and line high


There's no leaving here
Ask, I'm an ear
She's disappeared

They said timing was everything, made him
Want to be everywhere, there's a
Lot to be said for nowhere

There's no leaving here
Ask, I'm an ear
We√íve disappeared
There's no leaving here
Ask, I'm an ear
Fuck it, we'll disappear
