Unsealed on a porch a letter sat
Then you said, I wanna leave it again
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I wanna leave it again, yeah
On a weekend I wanna wish it all away, yeah
And they called and I said that: I want what I said
And then I call out again
And the reason oughta' leave her calm, I know
I said: I know what I were not a box or the bag


Ah yeah, can you see them out on the porch?
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them round the front way, yeah
And I know, and I know I don't want to stay
Make me cry

I see, oh I don't know why there's something else
I wanna drum it all away
Oh, I said: I don't, I don't know where there's a box or the bag

Ah yeah, can you see them out on the porch?
Yeah, but they don't wave
But I see them round the front way, yeah
And I know, and I know, I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna stay, yeah
I don't wanna stay
I don't, don't wanna stay at all, oh, yeah, ooh, ohh
