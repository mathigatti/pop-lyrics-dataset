I have not been home since you left long ago
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
Counting steps, walking backwards on the road
I'm counting my way back to heaven


I can't be free with what's locked inside of me
If there was a key, you took it in your hand
There's no wrong or right, but I'm sure there's good and bad
The questions linger overhead
No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
I wish that I could hold you
I wish that I had
Thinking 'bout heaven

I let go of a rope, thinking that's what held me back
And in time I've realized, it's now wrapped around my neck
I can't see what's next, from this lonely overpass
Hang my head and count my steps, as another car goes past
All the rusted signs we ignore throughout our lives
Choosing the shiny ones instead

I turned my back, now there's no turning back
No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead
I smile, but who am I kidding?
I'm just walking the miles, every once in a while I'll get a ride
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
Thumbing my way back to heaven
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
