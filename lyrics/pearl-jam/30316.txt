Do you see the way that tree bends?
Does it inspire?
Leaning out to catch the suns rays
A lesson to be applied
Are you getting something out of this
All encompassing trip?


You can spend your time alone
Redigesting past regrets, oh
Or you can come to terms and realize
You're the only one who can't forgive yourself
Makes much more sense
To live, in the present tense

Have you ideas on how this life ends?
Check your hands and study the lines
Have you ever believed that the road ahead
Ascends off into the light?
Seems that needlessly it's getting harder
To find an approach and a way to live
Are we getting something out of this
All encompassing trip?

You can spend your time alone
Redigesting past regrets
Or you can come to terms and realize
You're the only one who cannot forgive yourself
Make much more sense
To live in the present tense
