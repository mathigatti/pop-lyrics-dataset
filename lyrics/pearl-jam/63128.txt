Climbing on a mountain
Floating out an the sea
Far from lights of a city
The elements they speak to me...


Whispering that life
Existed long before greed
Balancing the World
On its knee...

Don't see some men as 1/2 empty
See them 1/2 full of shit
Thinking that we're all but slaves
There ain't  gonna be...

No middle any more
It's been said before
The haves be having more
Yet still bored...

Won't someone save?
Won't someone save?
The World?
