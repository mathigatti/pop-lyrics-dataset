Oh please, let it rain today
This city is so filthy, like my mind in ways
Oh, was a time, like a clean, new taste
Smiling eyes before me, inches from my face


Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love, yeah

Sin the sale, buying just a need
Just who planted, all the devils seeds
And what the truth, and the truth that lies at home
It's on the inside, and I can't get it off, yeah

Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love, yeah

What's clean is pure, but hey, I'm white on the outside, though I stray
What she don't know today, might kill us both tomorrow
Bring it back someway
Bring it back, bring it back, back to the clean form, to the pure form

Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Ooh
