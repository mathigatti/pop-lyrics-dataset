I will be the least of your burdens
My back is broken, my feet are hurtin'
All I want is to drink, please fuckin' leave me alone
I'll never be your beast of learning
I'm a stupid fuck, I don't know nothin' at all
All I want is to drink, maybe with just one other person


Am I hard enough? Am I tough enough?
I don't give a fuck
I just wanna live life and be dumb and happy like an American
All I want is for you to make love to me
Hey hey oh
Hey oh oh
Ooh, ooh

No time like the present to get ripped apart
Got this burnin' desire coming straight from my heart
Suck you dry
Suck
Suck you dry... S
Uck you dry
