Try to remember
but my feelings can't know for sure
Tryin' reach out
but it's gone


Lucky stars in your eyes
I'm walking the cow

I really don't know how I came here
I really don't know why I'm staying here
I am walking the cow

Try to point my finger
but the wind keeps blowing me around in circles
in circles

Lucky stars in your eyes
I'm walking the cow

I really don't know what I have to fear
I really don't know what I have to care for
I am walking the cow

Lucky stars in your eyes
