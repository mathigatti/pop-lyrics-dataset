Everyone’s a critic looking back up the river
Every boat is leaking in this town
Everybody is thinking they'll all be delivered
Sitting in a box like lost and found


But I found my place and it’s all right
We’re all searching for our better way
Got yours off my plate, it’s all right
I got my own way to believe

Find a lighthouse in the dark stormy weather
We all could use a sedative right now
Holy rollers sitting with their backs to the middle
All hands on deck, sinking is the bow

And if you wanna have to pray, it’s all right
We all be thinking with our different brain
Get yours off my plate, it’s all right
I got my own way to believe

It’s okay
Sometimes you find yourself
Having to put all your faith
In no faith
Mine is mine and yours won’t take its place
Now make your getaway

Science says we’re making love like the lizards
Try and say that fossils ain’t profound
Simon says that we are not allowed to consider
Simon says "Stand-up. Sit-down. You're out!"

But I found my place and it’s all right
Bearing witness to some stranger days
Get yours off my plate, it's alright
I got my own ways to believe

It’s okay
Sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
There’s no way
Mine is mine and yours won’t take its place
Now make your getaway

It’s okay
Sometimes you find yourself
Having to put all your faith
In no faith
Mine is mine and yours won’t take its place
Now make your getaway

It's ok
Sometime you find yourself
Being told to change your ways
For Gods sake
Mine is mine and yours won't take its place
Now make your getaway

Make your getaway
