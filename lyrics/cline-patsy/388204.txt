Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'
Please don't double-deal to win my heart
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'
Don't go breakin' rules right from the start


The ramblin', gamblin', reckless way you treat my heart's a sin
Each night down on my knees I pray your gamblin' ways will end
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'
And if you stack the deck, then I'll move on

(Repeat both verses)

Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin',
And if you stack the deck, then I'll move on
