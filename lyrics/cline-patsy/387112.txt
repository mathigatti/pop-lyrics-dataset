Now, baby if you're needin' me
The way that I been needin' you
Well, drop me a line
Sayin' honey you'll be mine
Write me in care of the blues


I hope that you've been missin' me
The way that I've been missin' you
I shouldn't have let you go
Because I miss you so
Write me in care of the blues

Give that postman your letter
And he'll know what to do
He'll bring your letter to me
And a plane will bring me to you

Now, baby if you're needin' me
The way that I been needin' you
Just drop me a line
Sayin' honey you'll be mine
Write me in care of the blues

(Repeat last two verses)

Write me in care of the blues
