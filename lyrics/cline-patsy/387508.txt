I've been so wrong, for so long
Thought I could live without the love that you give
I was wrong, oh, so wrong


I've been so wrong, for so long
I didn't know that I loved you so
I was wrong

CHORUS:
Well, I never knew I could want you darlin
Oh, so much
Now that you're gone, I dream of you
And your sweet touch

I was so wrong, for so long
But I've seen the light, darlin, I'll make it right
I was wrong

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT LAST VERSE
