On a day like today
We pass the time away
Writing love letters in the sand


How you laughed when I cried
Each time I saw the tide
Take our love letters from the sand

You made a vow that you
Would always be true
But somehow, that vow
Meant nothing to you

Now my poor heart just aches
With ev'ry wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand

With ev'ry wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand
