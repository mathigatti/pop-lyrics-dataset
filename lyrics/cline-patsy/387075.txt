I'm on a honky tonk merry-go-round,
Makin ever spot in town,
Startin out early, comin home late,
Ever night with a brand-new date!
I'm on a honky tonk merry-go-round,
Actin like a foolish clown,
Still racin those blues that you left with me,
Wonderin if I'll ever be free.
Round and around and around I go,
Ridin high and feelin low,
Round and around just like a top,
Well, I'm a-gettin dizzy, but I can't stop!
I'm on a honky tonk merry-go-round,
Actin like a foolish clown,
Still racin those blues that you left with me,
Wonderin if I'll ever be free.

Yes, I'm wonderin if I'll ever be free!
