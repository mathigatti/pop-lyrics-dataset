I go a walkin'
After midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
I'm always walkin'
After midnight
Searchin' for you


I walk for miles
Along the high-way
Well thats just my way
Of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin'
After midnight
searchin' for you

I stop to see a weapin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe hes cryin' for me
And at the skys turn gloomy
Night winds wisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go a walkin'
After midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be
Somewere a walkin'
After midnight
Searchin' for me

I stop to see a weapin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe hes cryin' for me
And at the skys turn gloomy
Night winds wisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go a walkin'
After midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hopin' you may be
Somewere a walkin'
After midnight
Searchin' for me
