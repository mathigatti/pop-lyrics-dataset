Come on dad get with the jive
Lets let em' know that we're alive
Until the break of dawn
We'll yell for more, more, more
Gonna live it up an tear it down
Get in the groove and paint the town
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul


Chorus:
Well now, baby baby let's go tonight
Together you and me
Baby baby when ya hold me tight
Oo wee whatcha do to me
The big black hands on the clock
Tell me that it's time to rock
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

--- Instrumental ---

Big Bad Pete with a crazy bop
When the lights are low an the musics hot
Dance from 2 ta 3 and then a half past 4
When that sun peeks over the hill
I won't stop I'll be rockin' still
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Chorus:
Well now, baby baby let's go tonight
Together you and me
Baby baby when ya hold me tight
Oo wee whatcha do to me
The big black hands on the clock
Tell me that it's time to rock
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

--- Instrumental ---

Chorus:
Well now, baby baby let's go tonight
Together you and me
Baby baby when ya hold me tight
Oo wee whatcha do to me
The big black hands on the clock
Tell me that it's time to rock
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul...
