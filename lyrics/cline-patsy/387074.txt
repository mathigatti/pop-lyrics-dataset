People point us out and shake their heads in shame
In gossip circles we are talked about
Darlin, on you I hold no legal claim
But here we are again hidin' out


The kisses that you give make our wrong seem so right
It's too late to stop, there's no doubt
We said we wouldn't meet tonight, my dear
But here we are again hidin' out

The ones we're tied to, we know we'll hurt, my dear
Though we're hoping they don't find us out
Sooner or later, we know we'll be caught
But here we are again hidin' out
