Happy, happy birthday baby,
Although youre with somebody new,
Thought Id drop a line to say,
That I wish this happy day,
Would find me beside you.


Happy, happy birthday baby,
No I cant call you my baby,
Seems like years ago we met,
On a day I cant forget,
Cause thats when we fell in love.

Do you remember,
The names we had for each other,
I was your pretty,
Your were my baby,
How could we say good bye.

Hope I didnt spoil your birthday,
