Tell a little white lie
And then multiply by ten
And then, that's how a heartache begins


Mix some flowers he bought
With a date he forgot to attend
And then, that's how a heartache begins

I know about heartaches
I know all the mistakes
That a young love can make, I've made them
So let's still be friends
To the soft violins
I've listened while somebody played them

Call his number in vain
Again and again, he's not in
But then, that's how a heartache begins

(Repeat last two verses)

That's how a heartache begins
