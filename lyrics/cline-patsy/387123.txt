I still want your lovin'
And I still need your lovin'
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain
Last night I saw you a-walkin
Talkin' with another
Overheard you tell her
Our love don't mean a thing
And as I walked away dear
My heart broke down inside me
I still want your lovin'
And I still need your lovin'
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain


I'd rather be a poor girl
Not a penny to my name
Than to know my life
Would all be lived in vain
I'd rather be alone dear
If you don't want to change
I still want your lovin'
And I still need your lovin'
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain
I still want your lovin'
And I still need your lovin'
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain
