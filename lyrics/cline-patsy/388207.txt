When my dreamboat, comes home
and my dream no more will roam
I will meet you and I'll greet you
when my dreamboat comes home.


Moomlit waters will sing
cause that tender love you'll bring
we will be sweethearts, yes forever
when my dreamboat comes home.

When my dreamboat, comes home
and my dream no more will roam
I will meet you and I'll greet you
when my dreamboat comes home.

Moonlit waters will sing
cause that tender love you'll bring
we will be sweethearts, yes forever
when my dreamboat comes home.
