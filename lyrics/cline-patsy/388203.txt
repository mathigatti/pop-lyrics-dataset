Try again, don't feel blue
Try again
I've been thru feelin blue
Same as you
I've been broken-hearted
And cried the whole night thru
Sorry now we've parted
Cause no one else will do


Try again, so they say
Try again
Say goodbye to the tear in your eye
Somethin' seems to tell me
That we could love again
Try again, says my heart
Try again

Try again
