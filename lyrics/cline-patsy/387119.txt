So long we've been married
Life's burdens we've carried
Tho' faith kept us humble
And made our love grow
The plans that we make up
Someone seems to break up
But darlin' what else can we do


(Chorus)
We may have to leave here
To find peace of mind, dear
Some place where we can live
A life all our own
For I know you love me
And happy we could be
If some folks would leave us alone

They say you are leaving
That you are deceiving
But you tell me they say
The same about me
But we'll show them that they're wrong
That loose talk will do harm
And hope that the truth they will see

(Chorus)

When I go out walkin'
There's lots of loose talkin'
They say we're unhappy
And we'll break apart
But, darling, it's not true
Because I still love you
And I do with all of my heart
Yeah!

(Chorus)
