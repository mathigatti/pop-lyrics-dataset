If you are sincere
When you say you don't care
That our love is just a memory
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me


CHORUS:
For if still lovin' you means I'm weak
Then I'm weak
For I still fall apart when we speak
Or we meet
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin you're stronger than me

If you can have fun
With some other one
With no thought of what used to be
If it's easy to say
That it's better this way
Darlin you're stronger than me

REPEAT CHORUS
