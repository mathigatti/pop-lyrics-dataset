I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms


Don't know why we quarreled
We never did be-fo-ore
Since we found out how it hurts
I bet we never quarrel anymore

I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms

Thought I didn't need his love
Till he took it a-wa-ay
Now I'm back where I belong
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay

I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms

Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms

Back in baby's arms
