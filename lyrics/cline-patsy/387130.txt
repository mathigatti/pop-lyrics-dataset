Right or wrong I'll be with you.
I'll do what you ask me to
For I believe that I belong.
By your side for right or wrong


Right or wrong it's got to be.
Always you and always me
Won't you take me along,to be with you for right or wrong.

If it's wrong for me to love you,it can't be wrong for me to call
If you should say you love me,my life-with you-I'll share

Right or wrong day by day.
All my love,all my way
I believe that I belong,by your side for right or wrong
