Tho' we said goodbye
When the moon was high
Does your heart beat for me
I wonder if I still linger
In your memory


When you hear my name
Is the thrill the same
As it once used to be
When you're lonesome, my sweetheart
Does your heart beat for me

When you hear my name
Hear my name
Is the thrill the same
Thrill the same
As it once used to be
When you're lonesome, my sweetheart
Does your heart beat for me
