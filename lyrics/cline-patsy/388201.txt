I've got my life in such a mess
And I don't know what to do
How can I live in this ol' world
And be in love with two
If I said goodbye to my first true love
My heart would break in two
For I'm halfway still in love with him
And half in love with you


(Chorus)
Tra le la le la le la triangle
Tra le la le la le la triangle
Tra le la le la le la triangle
My life's in such a tangle
Tra le la le la le la ~ triangle
Tra le la le la le la ~ triangle
Tra le la le la le la ~ triangle
What'll I do about you

I saw you at the movie show
Just the other day
But I was with my other love
So I looked the other way
I didn't want to hurt him
Couldn't bear for him to see
The way that I would look at you
And the way you look at me

(Repeat Chorus, 2X)

What'll I do about you...
