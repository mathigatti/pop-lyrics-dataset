Heartaches, heartaches
My loving you meant only heartaches
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me
I can't believe it's just a burning memory


Heartaches, heartaches
What does it matter how my heart breaks
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches for you

(Repeat verse 1 and 2)

Heartaches, heartaches
What does it matter how my heart breaks
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches
And my heart breaks
And my heart aches for you
