Yes, I know why I want to cry - it's over you
And I'm painting the town feelin' blue
If you've ever loved one that's untrue
Then you'll know why I want to cry - it's over you


Well tomorrow I'll be twice as blue
Well, I'm so low, I could die over you
I should've known that you'd never be true
Yes, I know why I want to cry - it's over you

Yes, I know why I want to cry - it's over you
And I'm painting the town feeling blue
Should you ever love one that's untrue
Then you'll know why I want to cry - it's over you
