We've been sweethearts for so long
But now you say we're through
The love we shared is now a memory


I had built a ship of dreams
And planned them all for you
And now I guess what is to be will be

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across the ocean blue

I'll sail my ship alone
Though all the sails you've torn
And when it starts to sink then I'll blame you

I gave a message to the wind
To take back home to you
Hoping you would hear my S.O.S.

Maybe you would come back home
My darling if you knew
How much my aching heart is in distress

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across the ocean blue

I'll sail my ship alone
Though all the sails you've torn
And when it starts to sink then I'll blame you
