I'm blue again
My friends all said I'd be
I'm blue again
Because your leavin' me


This heart of mine
So well remembers you
Although I've lost your love
To someone new

The nights are long
So long my darlin' hear me
I pray that dawn will come
And somehow, you'll be near me

I'm blue again
My heart is filled with tears
I'm blue again
As I think of wasted years

The nights are long
So long my darlin' hear me
I pray that dawn will come
And somehow, you'll be near me

I'm blue again
My heart is filled with tears
I'm blue again
As I think of wasted years
