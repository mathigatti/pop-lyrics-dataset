Tonight alone I 'm thinking of the things we use to do
There's laughter all around me but my heart still aches for you
The wedding bells are ringing
But to me their chimes are blue
How can I face tomorrow when I know I'm losing you


The dreams we shared have all been torn apart
It's your wedding day but I can't claim your heart
Now someone else will hold you just the way I use to do
How can I face tomorrow when I know I'm losing you
