Frosty the snowman 
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cop pipe 
And a button nose
And two eyes 
Made out of coal


Frosty the snowman 
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made out of snow
But the children know how 
He came to life one day
There must of been 
Some magic in
That ol' silk cap 
They found
For when they placed it 
On his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman 
Was alive as he could be
And the children say 
He could laugh and play
Just the same 
As you and me

Frosty the snowman 
Knew the snow 
Was hot that day
So he said lets run 
And have some fun 
Before I melt away
Down to the village 
With a broom stick 
In his hand
Runnin' here and there 
All around the square
Sayin' catch me 
If you can

He led them down 
The streets of town
Right 
To the traffic cop
And he only 
Paused a moment 
When he heard him 
Holler stop

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he 
Waved goodbye sayin' 
Please don't cry
I'll be back again 
Some day
