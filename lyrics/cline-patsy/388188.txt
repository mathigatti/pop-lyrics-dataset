I was [waltzing]* with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced [her to my loved one]** and while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me


I remember that night and the Tennessee Waltz
Only you know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz

(Repeat last verse)
