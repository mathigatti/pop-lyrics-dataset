Well, I know a cool cat from way downtown
Hes been boppin all around
In this ole world hes livin fast
Someday Im afraid hes gonna run outta gas
So if youre travelin that way, too
I tell you, friend, what you better do




Chorus:

Ya gotta stop, look and listen
Hey, ya dont know what youre missin
Ya gotta stop, look and listen
cause ya might be missin kissin
If youre travlin slow, youll go a long, long way

Now, farmer jones, he came to town
And saw that boppin all around
He learned to do it, theres no doubt
Im afraid someday hell burn his motor out
So if youre travelin that way, too
I tell you, friend, what you better do



Repeat chorus



First came the boogie, then the bunny hop
Now the rhumba, samba, then the bop
Well, I dont know whats a-comin next
But this ole worlds in a terrible fix
So if youre travelin that way, too
I tell you, friend, what you better do

Repeat chorus

Ya gotta stop, look and listen
Ya gotta stop, look and listen
Ya gotta stop, look and listen
Ya gotta stop
