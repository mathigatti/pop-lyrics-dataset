Two cigarettes in an ashtray
My love and I, in a small caf√©
Then a stranger came along
And everything went wrong
Now there's three cigarettes in the ashtray


I watched her take him from me
And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone
And I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away

I watched her take him from me
And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone
And I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away
