You think you love Sue
But when I get through with you
You won't ever look at Sue, again.


I'm gonna be so good to you
I'm gonna love you my whole life through
Pretty soon, you'll feel the same
You won't even know her name.

I'll give you kisses that she can't beat
I'll treat you so nice and sweet
When I get through with you
You'll love me true, not Sue.
When I get through with you
You'll love me true.

I'm gonna treat you so sweet and kind
I'll drive her right out of your mind
And you won't know her if you meet
Walk right by her on the street.

Because I want you and need you so
Poor Suzy, will have to go
When I get through with you
You'll love me true, not Sue.
When I get through with you
You'll love me true.

I'm gonna be so good to you
I'll love you my whole life through
Pretty soon, you'll feel the same
You won't even know her name.

I'll give you kisses that she can't beat
I'll treat you so nice and sweet
When I get through with you
You'll love me true, not Sue.

When I get through with you
You'll love me true, not Sue.

When I get through with you
You'll love me true, not Sue.

When I get through with you
You'll love me true...
