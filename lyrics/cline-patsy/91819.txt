Wake up every morning, heart's full of pain
Looked out the window, and it's pouring down the rain
And I cry, "baby, oh, baby
Don't ever leave me again"


I miss your lovin', your kisses too
Ain't nothin' on earth I wouldn't do for you
And I cry, "baby, oh, baby
Don't ever leave me again"

When rain starts falling
And I start calling
Oh baby, how I love you
My heart is cryin', I feel like dyin'

Baby you know, I want you so
Tell me that your mine till the end of time

And I cry, "baby, oh, baby
Don't ever leave me again
Don't ever leave me again"

When rain starts falling
And I start calling
Oh baby, how I love you
My heart is cryin', I feel like dyin'

Baby ya know, I want you so
Tell me that your mine till the end of time

And I cry, "baby, oh, baby
Don't ever leave me again, no
Don't ever leave me again"
