Have you talked to the Man upstairs
'Cause he wants to hear from you
Have you talked to the Man upstairs
He will always see you through
And this trouble ever troubles you
Now don't you run and hide
'Cause if you ever need a friend
He'll be there by your side
Just turn your eyes to heaven
And say a simple prayer
Through the clouds of lace
You'll see His face
No matter when or where
Have you talked to the Man upstairs
'Cause he wants to hear from you
Have you talked to the Man upstairs
He will always see you through
Have you talked to the Man upstairs
He wants to hear from you
Have you talked to the Man upstairs
He's always see you through
And this trouble ever troubles you
Well don't you run and hide
'Cause if you ever need a friend
Hell be there by your side
If you talk to the Man upstairs
