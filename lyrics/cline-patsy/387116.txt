Let the teardrops fall
You said you wasn't gonna call
You didn't love me at all
So let the teardrops fall
Since you've been gone
I've been so blue
And I spend my time
Just a-thinkin' of you


Well I sit here at home
By my telephone
Hopin' you'll change your mind
Well it's you I dream of
And I need your love
So tell me you'll be mine

'Cause the sun doesn't shine
And the moon it won't glow
And these lonely nights
All pass too slow
Sweet memories
I still recall
But I miss you so
So let the teardrops fall

(Repeat last two verses)
