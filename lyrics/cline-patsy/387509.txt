I know that someday, you'll want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody new
You expect me to be true, and keep on loving you
Tho' I am feeling blue, you think I can't forget you


Until someday you'll want me to want you
When I am strong for somebody else
And although you don't want me now, I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you

I know that someday, you're gonna want me to want you
When I am strong for somebody else
And although you don't want me now, I'm gonna get along somehow
And then I won't want you
I won't want you
And then I won't want you
