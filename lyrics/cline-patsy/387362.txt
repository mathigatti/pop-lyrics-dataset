Everything you told me I believed
You said that I was all that you'd ever need
That I made life worth livin' for you
And no one else could ever fill my shoes


(Chorus)
But them shoes don't fit me anymore
They lost their shape when I lost all that I cared for
And someone else will fill the shoes that I once wore
'Cause them shoes don't fit me anymore

When a shoe is new, it fits awful tight
When our love was new, ev'rything was right
When a shoe is old, you throw it away
Our love is like the shoes that you wore yesterday

(Repeat chorus)
