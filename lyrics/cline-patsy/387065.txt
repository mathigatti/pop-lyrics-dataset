He called me baby, baby, all night long
Used to hold and kiss me until dawn
Then one day I woke, and he was gone
Now there's no more baby, baby, all night long


He called me baby, baby, all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
Oh what I'd give, if he'd just come on back home
And call me baby, baby, all night long

He called me baby, baby, all night long
Built me up so high, and made me strong
Now each night, in dreams, just like a song
I still hear baby, baby
Still hear baby, baby
Still hear baby, baby, all night long
