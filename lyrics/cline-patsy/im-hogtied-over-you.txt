I'm hogtied over you
I'm hogtied over you
You're my baby and I don't mean maybe
I'm hogtied over you


Do you remember darling when we was on the farm
I'd chase you around the hog-pen and chase you in the barn
And then I'd grab a plow-point and crack you on the head
And then we'd both sit right down and laugh until we was almost dead

Do remember darling hunting duck eggs in the branch
And then youâ€™d grab and kiss me every time you had the chance
And then you'd hold me under until my face turned blue
But I'd come up a choking saying darling I love you

And as the years went by dear I learned to love you so
Until you dropped the anvil right on my little toe
And how you came to my house and watched me feed the hogs
And sit around with googoo eyes and pet your possum dog

And when we'd make molasses I'd always join you there
You'd get some on a cane stalk and stick it in my hair
And then you'd grab a shotgun and just before you'd shoot
Your ma would grin and say them young 'uns mercy ain't they cute

Oh I will always remember those days as long as I live
And all the things you did to me I surely will forgive
I remember in the haystack when you kissed me it was fun
If only when you'd kissed me you hadn't jumped up and run
I'm hogtied over you
