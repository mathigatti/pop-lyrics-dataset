Won't You Come Home Bill Baily
Won't You Come Home
I'm Home The Whole Night Long
I'll Do The Cookin' Honey
I'll Pay The Rent
I Know That I've Done You Wrong


Remember That Rainy Eve That I Drove You Out
With Nothin But A Fine Tooth Comb
Yes I Know That I'm Too Blame
Ain't That A Shame
Bill Baily Won't You Please Come Home

(Speeds Up)
Won't You Come Home Bill Baily
Won't You Come Home
I'm Home The Whole Night Long
I'ma Gunna Do Your Cookin' Honey
I'ma Gunna Pay Your Rent
I Know That I've Done You Wrong
(Won't You Come Home Bill Baily)

Remember That Rainy Eve That I Drove You Out
With Nothin But A Fine Tooth Comb
Well I Know That I'm To Blame
And Ain't That A Dirty Low Down Shame
Bill Baily Won't You Please Come Home
Come Home Bill Baily
Bill Baily Won't You Please Come On Home
Come Home Bill Baily
Bill Baily Won't You Please Come On Home
Come Home
