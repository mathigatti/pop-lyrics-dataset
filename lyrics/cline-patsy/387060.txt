For rent, for rent, an empty heart
Just say the word and you can move right in
A long-term lease can be arranged
And it will never be for rent again


I don't need no money, cause it won't last
Just lots of lovin', that's all I ask
Oh, my baby, for rent, for rent, an empty heart
Just say the word and you can move right in

(Repeat last verse)
