Well I met my little blue-eyed dog
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I met my little blue-eyed dog
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I asked him for a little kiss
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I asked him for a little kiss
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
I said have patience little man
But I'm sure you'll understand
I hardly know your name
You said If I can have my way
But it maybe some sweet day
Your name and my will be the same
Well I wed that little blue-eyed dog
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I wed that little blue-eyed dog
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
