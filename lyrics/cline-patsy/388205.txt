Walk walk walk
Walk walk walk
A walkin' dream
I dreamed about you
A walkin' dream
Can't do without you
Lovely dream
Just can't forget you
'cause your so dreamy
Peach n' creamy
Walkin' dream
Now keep on a walkin'
Keep on a talkin'
And i'll do my best
To make the rest
Of this lovely dream come true
A walkin' dream
I want you near me
Walkin' dream
Can't you hear me
A lovely dream
A won't you love me
'cause your so lovey
Turtle dovey
A walkin' dream




A walkin' dream
My heart is yearnin'
Walkin' dream
My lips are burnin'
A lovely dream
Of love i'm learnin'
Cause your surprisin'
Tantilizin', walkin' dream
Now keep on a walkin'
Keep on a talkin'
And i'll do my best
To make the rest
Of this lovely dream come true
A walkin' dream
I want you near me
A walkin' dream
Can't you hear me
Lovely dream
Won't you love me
'cause your so lovey
Turtle dovey, walkin' dream
Cause your so lovey
Turtle dovey, walkin' dream
