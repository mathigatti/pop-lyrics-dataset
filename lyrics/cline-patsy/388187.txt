Stupid cupid, you're a real mean guy
I'd like to clip your wings so you can't fly
I love him, it's a cryin' shame
And I know that you're the one to blame
Hey, hey, set me free
Stupid cupid, stop pickin' on me


I can't do my homework and I can't think straight
I meet him ev'ry mornin' about half past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool
He's even got my carrying his books to school
Hey, hey, set me free
Stupid cupid, stop pickin' on me

Well, you mixed me up but good
Right from the very start
Hey, don't play Robin Hood
With somebody else's heart

You got me jumpin' like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're puttin' down
Since I kissed your lovin' lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is I like it fine
Hey, hey, set me free
Stupid cupid, stop pickin' on me

Well, you mixed me up but good
Right from the very start
Hey, don't play Robin Hood
With somebody else's heart
With somebody else's heart
