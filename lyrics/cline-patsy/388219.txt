You say you love me
Then you treat me like a stranger
I don't understand your kind of love
You say you need me
And that makes it even stranger
No, I don't understand your kind of love


If you can't be all mine
Then why am I all yours
I wonder where a heart draws the line
I try not to see you
But you're a great arranger
No, I don't understand your kind of love

(Repeat last verse)

No, I don't understand your kind of love
