There he goes, he's walkin' away
Each step he takes brings heartaches my way
She won his heart, I lost him someway
There he goes, he's walkin' away


If I hadn't cheated and I hadn't lied
I'd be the one, walkin' by his side
I love him still and I guess that it shows
He's walkin' away, there he goes

Oh, if I hadn't cheated and I hadn't lied
I'd be the one walkin' by his side
I love him still and I guess that is shows
He's walkin' away, there he goes
