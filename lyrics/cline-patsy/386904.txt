Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

If I had one wish, I wish I could
Go back to my old neighborhood
Where the good folks they all love you as their own
Then I'd go over to my neighbor's house
Knock on the door 'n they'd all sing out
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home


I'd sing their praises long and loud
Cause their all my folks and I'm mighty proud
Of the little old town back home where I was born
I wish that I could hear them say
In the good old-fashioned, friendly way
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

Well, they don't lock their doors at night
'Cause they all know they're a-doin' right
And the good Lord's bound to have them for his own
If I'd go back to hear them pray
In the little pine church, they all would say
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

When I was a child of only three
I said my prayers at my mother's knee
And I knew right then from God I'd never roam
When I get my summons on the Judgment Day
I hope I can hear my Savior say
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home
Now, come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home
