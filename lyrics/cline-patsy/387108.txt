I'm a-walkin' the dog
And I'm never blue
I'm a-walkin' the dog
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Don't need no one
To tie me down
I'm a-walkin' the dog
And a-paintin' the town


Such an easy life
I never knew
Until the day
That I left you
Well, I'm a carefree lad
That's seen the light
I'm a-walkin' the dog
All the day and all night

Well, I'm full of pep
I just can't grow old
I got a one-track mind
So I've been told
But I'm fancy free
I don't worry no how
And, I'm walkin' the dog
All the law will allow

Such an easy life
I never knew
I can't believe
It's really true
Well, I'm a carefree lad
That's seen the light
And I'm a-walkin' the dog
All the day and all night
