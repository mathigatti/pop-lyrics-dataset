I cried all the way to the altar
A smile was on my face, but tears were in my heart
Two hearts broken, and a third will soon falter
Now too late, I know that we were wrong to part
Oh, my darlin', now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away my chance of happiness with you
I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we were wrong to part
Take a calendar and turn back all the pages
Take my life, turn back each day since I was born
I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I see the damage I have done
Oh, my darling, now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away my chance of happiness with you
I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we were wrong to part
