Who can I count on
If I can't count on you
I never counted on you
Makin' me blue
They say your a runnin' 'round
With somebody new
Who can I count on
If I can't count on you


I thought I held a precious key to heaven
Your love was sweet and gentle at the start
But now I feel that I can't go on livin'
If livin' means that we must live apart

Who can I count on
If I can't count on you
There goes my happiness
And here comes the blues
I can't convince myself that
We're really thru
Who can I count on
If I can't count on you

The door to happiness was almost open
Just one more step or two and I'd be in
Then all at once the vows you made were broken
The door to happiness was closed again

Who can I count on
If I can't count on you
There goes my happiness
And here comes the blues
I can't convince myself
That we're really thru
Who can I count on
If I can't count on you
Who can I count on
Who can I count on
Who can I count on
If I can't count on you
