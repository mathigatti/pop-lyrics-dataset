Down in Dallas, near the Palace
I met a boy who was so cute
I loved his huggin', I loved his kissin'
As we sat in his little red coupe
He said, tell me, confidentially
How much do you love me
Well, I thought awhile and then I smiled
And this is what I told him, dontcha see


I love you, honey, I love your money
I love your automobile
I love you, baby, I don't mean maybe
You're the sweetest thing on wheels
I love your kisses, I wouldn't miss it
No matter how I feel
I love you, honey, I love your money
Most of all I love your automobile
