Last night I dreamed
Of you, sweetheart
Once more you loved me
You said we'd never part


It's dawn again
Oh, how sad am I
My dream has ended
And tears fill my eyes

Gently swaying around my feet
Like memories from the past
Each leaf reminds me of a dream
A dream that wouldn't last

For once I know
Your promise you would keep
If I could only
Only stay asleep

(Repeat last two verses)
