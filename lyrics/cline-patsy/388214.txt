You made me love you, I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to do it
You made me want you, and all the time you knew it, I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes, sometimes you made me glad
But there were times, dear, you made me feel so bad
You made me sigh for, I didn't wanna tell you, I ddn't want to tell you
I want some lovin' that's true, yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do
Give me, give me, give me what I cry for, you know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you
You made me sigh for, I didn't want to tell you, I ddn't wanna tell you
I want some lovin' that's true, yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do
Give me, give me, give me what I cry for, you know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you
