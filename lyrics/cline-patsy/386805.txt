Row Row Row
Row Row Row
I use to have big money
That was many moons ago
You use to call me honey
Now you call me so and so
Cause there ain't no wheels on this ship
And we can't row row row
We can't row row row
We can't row
Row row row
Row row row
You use to be big papa
The cat of every ball
Now listen little papa
Well I'm at your big downfall
Cause there ain't no wheels on this ship
And we can't row row row
We can't row row row
We can't row
Row row row
Row row row
You use to like my lovin'
Because you liked my gold
Now ya don't want my lovin'
Cause there ain't no dough no more
And there ain't no wheels on this ship
And we can't row row row
We can't row row row
We can't row
Row row row
Row row row
Well I tell you for the last time
And I told you this before
If you want to keep your mama
Ya gotta love me more and more
Cause there ain't no wheels on this ship
And we can't row row row
We can't row row row
We can't row
