I go to church on a sunday
The vows I make
I break them on monday
The rest of the week
I do as I please
Then come sunday morning
I pray on my knees


Dear God, I know I'm not worthy
But I need you so, please, won't you hurry
And help me turn back from
The path I have trod
You'll never be sorry, dear God

Every week
We read in the paper
Of the carrings on
Of some our neighbors
Were lying and cheating
And forgeting our faith
Then we have the nerve
To ask is it to late

Dear God, I know I'm not worthy
But I need you so, please, won't you hurry
And help me turn back from
The path I have trod
You'll never be sorry, dear God
