sometimes its hard to be a woman
giving all your love to just one man 
you'll have bad times
and he'll have good times
doing things you don't understand
but if you love him 
please forgive him
even though hes hard to understand
and if you love him, oh be proud of him
'cause after all hes just a man


stand by your man
give him two arms to cling to
and something warm to come to 
when the nights are cold and lonely
stand by your man
and show the world you'll love him
keep giving all the love you can
stand by your man

and if you love him
oh be proud of him
'cause after all hes just a man

stand by your man
give him two arms to cling to
and something warm to come to
when the nights are cold and lonely
stand by your man 
and show the world you love him
and keep giving all the love you can
stand by your man
