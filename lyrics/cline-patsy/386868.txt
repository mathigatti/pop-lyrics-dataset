Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
It was on one moonlight night
Stars shining bright
Whisper on high
Love said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue


I said, blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

It was on one moonlit night, stars shinin' bright
Whispered on high, love said goodbye

I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Well, it was on one moonlit night, stars shinin' bright
Whispered on high, your lover said goodbye
I said, blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Left me blue
Left me blue
Left me blue
