Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through


Why cant I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams
About you

You dont love me its plain
I should know I'll never wear your ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Sweet dreams of you
Things I know can't come true
Why cant I forget the past
Start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
