Once my soul was in sin
And my heart was in shame
I didn't know Jesus
Not even His name
Then I heard a voice say
Won't you come unto me
And He will do for you
What He's done for me
Give Him a chance
And let Him show you
He'll answer when you call
His love is the sweetest
His promise is free
For He will do for you
What He's done for me
Give Him a chance
And let Him prove it
His love is best of all
Give Him a chance
And let Him show you
He'll answer when you call
His love is sweetest
His promise is free
For He will do for you
What He's done for me
