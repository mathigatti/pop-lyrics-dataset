Once my love was good enough
True happiness we knew
Then fame and fortune came your way
And made a change in you
You'll find your ladder of success
Is not on solid ground
And when it starts to tumble
Pick me up on your way down


CHORUS:
Pick me up when dreams are shattered
When false friends cannot be found
For you know I'll still be waiting
Pick me up on your way down

You've hit the top, but it won't last
There's just one way to go
The world you've chosen is not real
These things you'll come to know
When folks say they don't know you
And you've lost your final round
When you find that you are lonely
Pick me up on your way down

REPEAT CHORUS
