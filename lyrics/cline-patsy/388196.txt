You don't know the meaning
Of the words "I love you so"
But when you've found your one love
Then - you'll know


You don't know the heartache
Or the laughter you'll forego
Until you've lost that one love
Then - you'll know

Now you pretend to care for me
But, honey, if you do
Why don't you give the kind of kiss
I always give to you

So, I've just made my mind up
Even tho' my tears will flow
Go on and find a new love
Then - you'll know

(Repeat last two verses)

Then - you'll know
