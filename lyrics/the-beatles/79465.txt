It's all too much
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see


It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time
Of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are
Or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

Sail me on a silver sun
For I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere
And get me home for tea

It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take it's all too much

It's too much
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
It's too much

With your long blonde hair and your eyes are blue
With your long blonde hair and your eyes are blue
You're too much
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
You're too much,ah
We are dead, ah!

Too much
Too much
Too much...
