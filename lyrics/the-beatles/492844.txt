I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do, it's for you.
Love true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true, it's for you


They said that love was a lie
Told me that I should never try to find
Somebody who'd be kind, kind to only me
So I just tell them, they're right, who
Wants a fight?
Tell them, I quite agree, nobody'd love me
Then I look at you, and
Love comes, love shows
I give my heart and no-one knows that I do
It's for you
It's for you
