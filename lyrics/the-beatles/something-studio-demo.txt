Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover


Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

You know I love that woman of mine
And I need her all of the time
Now I'm telling you
That woman, that woman don't make me blue

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You know I believe and how
