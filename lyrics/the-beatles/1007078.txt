I know it's true, it's all because of you
And if I make it through, it's all because of you
And now and then, if we must start again
Well we were not sure, that I love you


I don't want to lose you - oh no, no, no
Lose you or abuse you - oh no, no, no, sweet doll
But if you have to go, away
If you have to go, I know, you never to come

Now and then, I miss you
Oh now and then, I want you
Come back to me, I know, return to me

I know it's true, it's all because of you
And if you go away, I know, you no back to me

I don't want to lose you - oh no, no, no
Abuse you or confuse you - oh no, no, no, sweet doll
But if you had to go, away
Well I won't stop you baby
And if you had to go
Well, you don't believe in we
