As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you


Treasure these few words
Till we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

I'll be comin' home again to you, love
Until the day I do love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

As I write this letter

Be in love with you

Treasure these few words
Till we're together

As I write this letter (oh)
Send my love to you (you know I want you to)

Be in love with you

I'll be comin' home again to you, love
Until the day I do love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you
You, you, you
I love you
