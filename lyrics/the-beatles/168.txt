Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond say to Molly, girl I like your face
And molly says this as she takes him by the hand


Obladi, oblada
Life goes on, brah
La la how their life goes on
Obladi, oblada
Life goes on, brah
La la how their life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jewelers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring, (rin-ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (sin-sing)

Obladi, oblada
Life goes on, brah
La la how their life goes on
Obladi, oblada
Life goes on, brah
La la how their life goes on

Yeah, in a couple of years they
Have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band

Obladi, oblada
Life goes on, brah
La la how their life goes on
Obladi, oblada
Life goes on, brah
La la how their life goes on

In a couple of years they
Have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band

Obladi, oblada
Life goes on, brah
La la how their life goes on
Obladi, oblada
Life goes on, brah
La la how their life goes on
And if you want some fun
Take ob-la-di, bla-da
