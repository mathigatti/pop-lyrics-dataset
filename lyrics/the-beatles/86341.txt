I never knew that a day 
like today lay before us. 
I've got the sun in my heart 
and my heart's in the sun. 
Skies are as bright 
as your eyes, 
the horizon is open.
Love is the ceiling, 
feelings are reelings 
free as the air. 
Forever on and forever,
forever on side by side. 
who ever knew that we two 
could be free as we'd fancy, 
fancy is free 
but are we bound 
to each other by love,
to each other by love? 
Who ever knew that we two 
could be free as we'd fancy, 
fancy is free 
but are we bound 
to each other by love,
to each other by love, 
to each other by love, 
to each other by love?
