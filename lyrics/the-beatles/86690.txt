Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And surrender to me (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms for loving me
Baby, that's the way it's gotta be (Ooh)


There ain't no reason for you to declare
War on the one that loves you so
So forget the other boys 'cause my love is real
Come off your battlefield

Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me tenderly (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't wanna fight no more (Ooh)

The weapons you're using are hurtin' me bad
But someday you're gonna retreat
That my love for you baby, is the truest you've ever had
A Soldier of Love, that's hard to be

Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And surrender to me (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms to squeeze and please cos I'm the one that loves you so
(Yeah, soldier of love) Baby, lay down your arms
(Yeah, soldier of love) Baby, lay down your arms
(Yeah, yeah)
