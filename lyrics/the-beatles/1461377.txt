So few years ago her daddy held her in his arms
Snugged the blanket around her feet to help and keep 'em warm
When he kissed her tender cheek, oh, how her eyes would shine
His ev'ry dream was built around his daughter Caroline


He remembered ev'ry time she'd turn another year
And, at the birthday parties, when he'd shed a happy tear
Thinking of the wedding dress that she would wear someday
When he'd have to give his daughter Caroline away

He thought of what he saw the night they called her from the roll
A silver graduation ring and engagement ring of gold
It seems as tho' twas yesterday he met her valentine
And now she's grown and here to wed his daughter Caroline

Maarching on his arm she whispered, "Pa, I still love you"
Those words remained within his ears when she vowed, "I do"
Cheer was sparkling from his eyes, but tears were in behind
When he gave his heart away, his daughter Caroline
