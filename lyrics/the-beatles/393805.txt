When I see you
I just don't know what to say.
I like to be with you
Every hour of the day.
So if you want me
Just like I need you,
You know what to do.


I watched you walking by
And you looked alone.
I hope that you won't mind
If I walk you home.
And if you want me
Just like I need you,
You know what to do.

Just call on me
When you're lonely.
I'll keep my love
For you only.
I'll call on you
If I'm lonely too.

Understand I'll stay
With you every day.
Make you love me more
In every way.
So if you want me
Just like I want you.
You know what to do.

Just call on me
When you're lonely.
I'll keep my love
For you only.
I'll call on you,
If I'm lonely too.
Understand I'll stay,
With you every day.
Make you love me more
In every way.
So if you want me
Just like I want you.
You know what to do.
