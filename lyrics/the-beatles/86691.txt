Ow! 
Some other guy, now, has taken my love away from me, oh now 
Some other guy, now, has taken away my sweet desire, oh now 
Some other guy, now, I just don't wanna hold my hand, oh now 
I'm the lonely one 
As long as I can feel all right 
Some other guy is sippin' up the honey like a yellow dog, oh now
Some other guy, now, has taken my love just like I'm gone, oh now 
Some other guy, now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
I'm the lonely one 
As long as I can feel all right
Wo wo ho ho 
Some other guy, now, is makin' me very very mad, oh now 
Some other guy, now, is makin' my past seem oh so bad, oh now
Some other guy, now, she was the first girl I ever had, oh now 
I'm the lonely one 
As long as I can feel all right
Wo wo ho ho 
I'm a-talkin' to you, right now, hey! Ow!
