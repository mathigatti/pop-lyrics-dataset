If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
Don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out, find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon as you don't have long.


Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there.

If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there.

Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there.

Looking for release from limitation
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way brings results.
