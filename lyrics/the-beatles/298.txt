Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight for a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight for a long time


I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitation
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight for a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight for a long time

You never give me you number
You only give me your funnypapers
And in the middle of interogation
I break down

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight for a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight for a long time
