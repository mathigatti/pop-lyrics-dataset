I found it out
What love is all about
And every day
It sure lets out
I see my baby
I get weak in my knees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
My pappie told me
There'd be times like these
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees


We meet the gang
And go to rocking Joes
The cats are something
On the heels and toes
I grab my baby
Tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be
Such a doggone tease?
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees

She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I begged her for kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some loving, baby
Please please please

Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the Sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees, yeah

She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I'm begging for her kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some of your loving, baby
Please please please

Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the Sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
