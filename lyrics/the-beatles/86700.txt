A friend says that your love
Won't mean a lot.
And you know that your love
Is all you've got.
At times things are so fine
And at times they're not.
But when she says she loves you,
That means a lot.


A friend says that a love
Is never true.
And you know that this
Can't apply to you
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got.
When she says she loves you
That means a lot.

Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide
What you feel when it's real

A friend says that your love
Won't mean a lot
And you know that your love
Is all you've got
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got.
When she says she loves you
That means a lot
