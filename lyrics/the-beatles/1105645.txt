Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby and I love her so
Every morning when the Sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so


When I call her on the telephone
She says: Baby, I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door

In the evening when the Sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
She says: Baby everything is alright
That's why I know, that's why I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love that chick so
