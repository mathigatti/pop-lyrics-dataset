Here in some stranger's room
(Lost my concentration)
Late in the afternoon


What am I doing here at all?
(Heads across the sky)

Somehow the wires have crossed
(Lost my concentration)
Communication's lost

Can't even get you on the telephone
(Heads across the sky)

Talking to myself

Crying out loud
(Heads across the sky)
Talking to myself

(Heads across the sky)
Crying out loud

You say your not getting enough
(Lost my concentration)
But I remind you of all that bad, bad, bad stuff

So what the hell am I supposed to do?
(Heads across the sky)

Talking to myself

Crying out loud
(Heads across the sky)
Talking to myself

(Heads across the sky)
Crying out loud

Talking to myself

Crying out loud
(Heads across the sky)
Talking to myself

(Heads across the sky)
Crying out loud
(Heads across the sky)
