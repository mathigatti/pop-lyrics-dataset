Hello, little girl
Hello, little girl
Hello, little girl


When I see you every day
I say, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl
When you're passing on your way
I say, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl
When I see you passing by
I cry, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl
When I try to catch your eye
I cry, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl

I send you flowers
But you don't care
You never seem to
See me standin' there
I often wonder
What you're thinkin' of
I hope it's me
And love, love, love
So I hope there'll come a day when
You say, mmm-mmm, you're my little girl

It's not the first time
That it's happened to me
It's been a long, lonely time
And it's so funny
So funny to see
That I'm about to loose
My mind, mind, mind
So I hope there'll come a day when
You say, mmm-mmm, you're my little girl

Mmm-mmm, you're my little girl
Mmm-hmm, you're my little girl
Oh, yeah, you're my little girl
