There's a fog upon L. A.
And my friends have lost their way.
"We'll be over soon," they said.
Now, they've lost themselves instead.


Please don't be long.
Please don't you be very long.
Please don't be long
Or I may be asleep.

Well, it only goes to show
And I told them where to go.
Ask a p'liceman on the street.
There's so many there to meet.

Please don't be long. (Don't be long.)
Please don't you be very long. (Don't be long.)
Please don't be long
Or I may be asleep.

Now, it's past my bed, I know, (Know..)
And I'd really like to go. (Go..)
Soon will be the break of day (Day..)
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way. (Way..)

Please don't be long. (Don't be long.)
Please don't you be very long. (Don't be long.)
Please don't be long
Or I may be asleep.

Please don't be long.
Please don't you be very long.
Please don't be long.
Please don't you be very long.
Please don't be long.
Please don't be long.
Please don't you be very long.
Please don't be long.
Don't be long.
Don't be long.
Don't be long.
Don't be long.
Don't be long.
Don't be long.
Don't be long.
