Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird


Home, home and dry
Like a hummingbird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so

Free as a bird
Like the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home, home and dry
Like a hummingbird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
