Goodbye, joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh.
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou.
My yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh.
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou.


Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'cause tonight i'm gonna see my ma cher amio.
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo,
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou.

Thibodaux, fontaineaux, the place is buzzin',
Kinfolk come to see yvonne by the dozen.
Dress in style and go hog wild, and be gayo.
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou.

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'cause tonight i'm gonna see my ma cher amio.
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo,
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou.

(oh, guitar)

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'cause tonight i'm gonna see my ma cher amio.
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo,
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou.

(oh, lord!
Hang tight, ooh lord!
Ah, take it out.
He's comin', ah!)
