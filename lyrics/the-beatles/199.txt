Groovin' up slowly, he got
Ju-ju eyeballs, he want
Holy rollers, he got
Hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please


He wear no shoeshine, he got
Toe-jam football, he got
Monkey finger, he shoot

One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Come together, right now
Over me

He bag production, he got
Walrus gumboot, he got
Ono sideboard, he one
Spinal cracker, he got
Feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease

Come together, right now
Over me

He roller coaster, he got
Early warning, he got
Muddy water, he one
Mojo filter, he say
One and one and one is three
Got to be good looking, 'cause he's so hard to see

Come together, right now
Over me

Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah

Come together, yeah
