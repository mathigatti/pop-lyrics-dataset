This happened once before
When I came to your door, no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window


I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said that you were not home, that's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door

I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

I've tried to telephone
They said you were not home, that's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw her walk in your door

I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
No reply, no reply
