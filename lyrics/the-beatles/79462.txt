Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?


He went out tiger hunting with his elephant gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
But when he looked so fierce, his mummy butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
