Rodney Burke: Now, for the final number John's got a card in his hand
with a little rhyme on it. What is it?


John: It's from the form upper third at Hemmel Homestead, it says:
Dear Geroge, John, Ringo, Paul
Here's hoping that you please us all
A Beaty song on swinging voice
We'll leave it up to you, the choice
We think you're fab, and really cool
So, brighten up our lives at school
Dig this.

So, here's Paul wissling Clarabella.
