Oh, I need your love babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you


Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothin' but love babe
Eight days a week

Love you everyday girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you all the time

Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me

I ain't got nothin' but love girl
Eight days a week, eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week is not enough to show I care

Oh, I need your love babe
Yes you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you

Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me

I ain't got nothing but love babe
Eight days a week, eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week is not enough to show I care

Love you everyday girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you all the time

Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me

I ain't got nothin' but love babe
Eight days a week, eight days a week, eight days a week
