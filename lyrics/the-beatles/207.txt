Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love


There's nothing you can do
That can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say
But you can learn how the play the game
It's easy

There's nothing you can make
That can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do
But you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

There's nothing you can know
That isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be
That isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

All you need is love
(All together, now!)
All you need is love
(Everybody)
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
(Love is all you need)
(She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
