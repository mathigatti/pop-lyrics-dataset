Your day breaks
Your mind aches
You find that all
Her words of kindness
Linger on
When she no longer needs you


She wakes up
She makes up
She takes her time
And doesn't feel
She has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her
You need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says
Her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home
She goes out
She says that long ago
She knew someone
But now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks
Your mind aches
There will be times
When all the things she said
Will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
