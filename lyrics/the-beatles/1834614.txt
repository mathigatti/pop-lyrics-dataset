Ready set go man go
I got a gal that i love so


I'm rea-dy rea-dy rea-dy teddy
I'm rea-dy rea-dy rea-dy teddy
I'm rea-dy rea-dy rea-dy teddy
Rea-dy rea-dy rea-dy to
Rock'n'roll

Going down to the corner
Pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock'n'roll baby
She's the apple of my eye, 'cause

Flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumping
The cats are going wild
The music really sends me
I dig that crazy style 'cause

Gonna kick off my shoes
Roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock'n'roll baby
Pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left
I shuffle to the right
I'm gonna rock'n'roll
Till the early early night 'cause
