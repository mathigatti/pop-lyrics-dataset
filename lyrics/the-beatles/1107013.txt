Tell them I remember you

I remember too a distant bell
And stars that dwell
Like the rain out of the blue


When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them
I remember you

I remember too a distant bell
And stars that dwell
Like the rain out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them
I remember you

I remember too a distant bell
And stars that dwell
Like the rain out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them
I remember
Tell them I remember
Tell them I remember
Tell them I remember you
