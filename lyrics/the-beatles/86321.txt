Besame besame mucho, 
Each time I bring you a kiss
I hear music divine. 
So besame besame mucho, 
Yeh I love you for ever 
Say that you'll always be mine.
Dearest one, if you should leave me
Then each little dream will take wings 
And my life would be through. 
So besame besame mucho, 
Yeh I love you for ever, 
Make all my dreams come true.
Oh this joy is something new, 
My arms are holding you, 
I never knew this thrill before.
Who ever thought I'd be 
Holding you close to me 
Whispering it's you I adore. 
So dearest one, if you should leave me
Then each little dream will take wings 
And my life would be through. 
So besame besame mucho, 
Yeah I love you for ever, 
Make all my dreams come true. 
Oh this joy is something new, 
My arms are holding you, 
I never knew this thrill before.
Who ever thought I'd be 
Holding you close to me 
Whispering it's you I adore.
So dearest one, if you should leave me,
Each little dream will take wings 
And my life would be through. 
So besame besame mucho, 
Yeh love me for ever, 
Make all my dreams come true. 
Love me for ever, 
Make all my dreams come true.
Love me for ever, 
Make all my dreams come true.
