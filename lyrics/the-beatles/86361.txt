I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you


I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna love you more and more every way
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you

I'm gonna tell your Mama
Tell your Papa too
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna do
If you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
Wah-hoo!

I'm gonna tell your Mama
Tell your Papa too
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna do
If you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
