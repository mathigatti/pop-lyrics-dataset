I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that


Well, Its the second time
I've caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time I think its a sin
I think I'll let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Everybody's green
Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face.

So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can't help my feelings i'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Wah!

(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)

Everybody's green
Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that
