Somedays I don't
I don't believe that you are mine
Somedays I look
I look at you with eyes that shine


You are my strength
When we're apart
You are my strength
When we're apart

It's no good asking me what time of day it is
No use reminding me, it's just the way it is
Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall
It's no good asking me, it's just the way it is

Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were
Sometimes it's hard
It's hard to know which way to turn

Ev'ry night we fuss and fight
Like me and you know who
(We don't need anybody else)
Ev'ry night we fuss and fight
Like me and you know who
(We don't need anybody else)
Ev'ry night we fuss and fight
Like me and you know who
(We don't need anybody else)
Ev'ry night we fuss and fight
Like me and you know who
(We don't need anybody else)

(We don't need)
(We don't need)

Somedays I cry
I cry for those who live in fear
Somedays I look
Somedays I look into your soul
It's no good asking me what time of day it is

Who won the match or scored the goal
Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall
How much it cost or what it's worth

Inside each one of us is love
('Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea)
('Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree)
Inside each one of us is love
('Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea)
('Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree)
I guess love is always just
(Good for you)

'Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea
'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree
