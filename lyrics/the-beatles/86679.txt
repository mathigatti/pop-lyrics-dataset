Cream tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news


But you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream and nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues

But you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through, you're gonna know and how
The sweat's gonna fill your head
But when it becomes too much, you'll shout aloud

But you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle

You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me where you are?

Cream tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news

But you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle

Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle
