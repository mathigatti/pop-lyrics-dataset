Standing in the deck at South Hampton
Trying to get Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "you've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance


Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it  can be
The way things are going they're going to crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the seine
Peter brown called to say,"you can make it ok,
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain"

Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be
The way things are going they're going to crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspaper said "say what're you doin' in bed?"
I said "we only try to get us some peace"

Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be
The way things are going they're going to crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to the charity
Last night the wife said "oh, boy when you're dead,
You don't take nothing with you, but your soul,
Think!"

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said "she's gone to his head,
They look just like 2 gurus in drag"

Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be
The way things are going they're going to crucify me

Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said " we wish you success,
It's good to have the both of you back"

Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be
The way things are going they're going to crucify me
