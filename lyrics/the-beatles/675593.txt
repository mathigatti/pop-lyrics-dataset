Each time I look into your eyes
I see that there a heaven lies
and as I look
I see the love of the loved.


Someday they'll see that from the start
my place has been deep in your heart.
And in your heart
I see the love of the loved.

Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more,
now that I'm really sure
you love me.

And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
that you look at me
and say ah you love me.

So let it rain, I'll never care?
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there.
And when I'm there
I see the love of the loved.

Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more,
now that I'm really sure
you love me.

And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
that you look at me
and say ah you love me.

So let it rain, I'll never I care?
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there.
And when I'm there

I see the love of the loved.
I see the love of the loved.
I see the love of the loved.
