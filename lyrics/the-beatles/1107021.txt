Red sails in the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me


She sailed at the dawning
Oh way out and blue
Red sails in the sunset
I'm counting on you

Red sails in the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me

Sweet wind we must borrow
Make straight for the shore
We'll marry tomorrow
And you'll go sailing no more

Red sails in the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me

Sweet wind we must borrow
Make straight for the shore
We'll marry tomorrow
And she'll go sailing no more

Red sails at the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me
