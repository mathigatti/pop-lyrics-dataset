Step inside love and stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay
You look tired, love
Let me turn down the light
Come in out of the cold
Rest your head on my shoulder
And kiss me tonight
We are together now
And forever, come my way
Step inside love and stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay
