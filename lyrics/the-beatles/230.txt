I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I
Should never never never be blue


Now you're mine
My happiness dear makes me cry
And in time
You'll understand the reason why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe
It's happened to me
I can't conceive of anymore misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I
Should never never never be blue

Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I can't believe, it's happened to me
I can't conceive of anymore misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you, you, you
