If you wear red tonight,
Remember what i said tonight.
For red is the color that my baby wore,
And what's more, it's true,
Yes it is.


Scarlet were the clothes she wore.
Everybody knows, i'm sure.
I would remember all the things we planned,
Understand, it's true.
Yes it is, it's true,
Yes it is.

I could be happy with you by my side,
If i could forget her.
But it's my pride,
Yes it is, yes it is, oh yes it is, yeah.

Please don't wear red tonight.
This is what i said tonight.
For red is the color that will make me blue,
In spite of you.
It's true.
Yes it is, it's true,
Yes it is.

I could be happy with you by my side,
If i could forget her.
But it's my pride,
Yes it is, yes it is, oh yes it is, yeah.

Please don't wear red tonight.
This is what i said tonight.
For red is the color that will make me blue,
In spite of you.
It's true,
Yes it is, it's true.
Yes it is, it's true.
