He had plastic bags wrapped round his shoes
He was covered with the evening news
He had a pair of ol' wool socks on his hands
The bank sign was flashing 5 below
It was freezing rain and spitting snow
he was curled up behind some garbage cans
i was afraid that he was dead
i gave him a gentle shake
when he opened up his eyes
i said ol' man are you ok?... he said...


I just climed out of a cotton wood tree
i was running from some honey bees
drip drying in the summer breeze
after jumping in the calacoe creek
i was walking down an old dirt road
passed a field of hay that had just been mowed
man i wish you'd just left me alone
cuz i was almost home

and he said i had just coming round the barn
bout time you grabbed my arm
when i heard momma holla
son hurry up
i was close enough from my own nose
to smell fresh cogger on the stove
and i saw daddy loadin' up the truck
game polls on the tail gate
bobbers blowing in the wind
Since July of '55
that's as close as I've been...

(chorus)

I said ol' man you're gonna freeze to death
let me drive you to the mission
he said,
