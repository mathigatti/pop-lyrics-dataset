Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on
While I see it your way
Run the risk of knowing
That our love may soon be gone


We can work it out
We can work it out
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong
And still you think that it's all right

Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out
And get it straight or say goodnight

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short
And there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend

I have always thought
That it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While I see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart
Before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short
And there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend

I have always thought
That it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While I see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart
Before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out
