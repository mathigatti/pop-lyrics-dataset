Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true
I love you more than ever girl I do
I want you in the morning girl I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living for ev'ry moment girl for you
I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to
I feel it now I hope you feel it too
Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true
I love you more than ever girl I do
I really love you
