Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me


'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all

'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

If you drive a car
I'll tax the street
If you try to sit
I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold
I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk
I'll tax your feet

Taxman!

'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Don't ask me what I want it for
(Uh-uh, Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Uh-uh, Mr. Heath)

'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

And my advice for those who die
(Taxman!)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
(Taxman!)

'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

And you're working for no one but me
(Taxman!)
