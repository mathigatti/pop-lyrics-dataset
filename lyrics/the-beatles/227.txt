It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, till I belong to you


Every night when everybody has fun
Here am I sitting all on my own

It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, till I belong to you

Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home

Every night the tears come down from my eyes
Every day I've done nothing but cry

It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, till I belong to you

Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home

So every day we'll be happy I know
Now I know that you won't leave me no more

It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, till I belong to you, woo
