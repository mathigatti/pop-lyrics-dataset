As i was slowly passing
An orphan's home one day
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the childern play
Alone a boy was standing
And when i asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry



I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I am growing wild
I've got no mammy's kisses
I've got no, no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

No mammy's arms to hold me
Or soothe me when i cry
'cause sometimes i feel so lonesome
I wish that i could die
I'd walk the streets of heaven
Where all the blind can see
And just like all the other kids there'd be a home for me

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I'm, i'm growing wild
I've got no mammy's kisses
I've got no, no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child
