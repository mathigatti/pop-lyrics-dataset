The leaves of brown
Came tumbling down
Remember in september in the rain.
The sun went out
Just like a light
Remember in september in the rain.


To every word
Of love i heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring
To me it's still september
Oh that september in the rain.

To every word
Of love i heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring
To me it's still september
Oh that september in the rain
I said i said it's september in the rain
Ah september in the rain
