On the road to Rishikesh
I was dreaming more or less,
And the dream I had was true
Yes, the dream I had was true


I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just child of nature
I'm one of nature's children

Sunlight shining in your eyes
As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes, my thoughts return to home

I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one nature's children

Underneath the mountain ranges
Where the wind that never changes
Touch the windows of my soul
Touch the windows of my soul

I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature's children
