Oh, darling
Please, believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm


Oh, darling
If you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone

When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, I nearly
Broke down and cried
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, I nearly
Broke down and died

Oh, darling
If you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me, darling

When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, I nearly
Broke down and cried
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, I nearly
Broke down and died

Oh, darling
Please believe me
I'll never let you down
Oh, believe me, darling
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
