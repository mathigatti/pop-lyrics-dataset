My skinny Minnie is a crazy chick,
Six foot high and one foot thick
Do I love her
Does a boy love pie
She is the apple of my eye,
Skinny Minnie
She ain't skinny, she's tall, that's all


Tho' her shadow doesn't take much ground
What there is sure gets around
What there ain't that's what she be
'N' even that's too much for me
Skinny Minnie
She ain't skinny, she's tall, that's all

Slightly slimmer than a fishing pole
One half rock and one half roll
Dig that chick from either side
Man, you'll yell "Where did she hide"
Skinny Minnie
She ain't skinny, she's tall, that's all
