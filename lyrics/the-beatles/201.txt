You say yes, I say no
You say stop, but I say go, go, go


Oh no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello, hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello

I say high, you say low
You say why and I say I don't know

Oh no
You say goodbye and I say hello
(Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye)
Hello, hello
(Hello, goodbye)
I don't know why you say goodbye I say hello
(Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye)
Hello, hello
(Hello, goodbye)
I don't know why you say goodbye I say hello
(Hello, goodbye)

(Why, why, why, why, why, why do you say)
(Goodbye, goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)

Oh no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello, hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello

You say yes (I say yes)
I say no (but I may mean no, I can stay till it's time to go)
You say stop
And I say go go go

Oh no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello, hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello, hello, hello
