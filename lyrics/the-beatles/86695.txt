They're really rocking in Boston
In Philadelphia PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
On down the Frisco Bay
All over Saint Louis
And down in New Orleans
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen
Sweet little sixteen
She's just got to have
About half a million
Framed autopraphs
Her wall is filled with pictures
She gets them one by one
Becomes so excited
Oh watch her at the run boy
Oh mommy mommy
Please may I go
You know it's such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show
Oh daddy daddy
I beg of you
Please say it to mommy
It's alright with you
Sweet little sixteen
She's got the grown up blues
Tight dresses and lipstick
She's sporting in high heeled boots
Oh but tomorrow morning
She'll have to change her trend
Become sweet sixteen
And back in class again
They're really rocking in Boston
In Philadelphia PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
And down the Frisco Bay
All over Saint Louis
On down in New Orleans
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen
