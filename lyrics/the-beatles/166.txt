Words are flowing out
Like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass
They slip away across the universe


Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai guru deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light
Which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on
Across the universe

Thoughts meander like a restless
Wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make
Their way across the universe

Jai guru deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of love
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me

Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on
Across the universe

Jai guru deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
