Well, how come you say you will
When you won't?
Say you do, baby
When you don't?
Let me know, honey
How you feel
Tell the truth, now
Is love real?


But, uh-uh, well
Honey, don't
Well, honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
I say, you will
When you won't
Uh-uh, honey, don't

Well, I love you, baby
And you ought to know
I like the way
That you wear your clothes
Everything about you
Is so doggone sweet
You got that sand
All over your feet

But, uh-uh, well
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
I say, you will
When you won't
Uh-uh, honey, don't

Well, sometimes I love you
On a Saturday night
Sunday mornin', you
Don't look right
You been out
Paintin' the town
Uh-uh, baby
Been steppin' around

But, uh-uh, well
Honey, don't
I said, honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
I say, you will
When you won't
Uh-uh, honey, don't

Well, honey, don't
Well, honey, don't
Little, little honey, don't
I say, you will
When you won't
Uh-uh, honey, don't
