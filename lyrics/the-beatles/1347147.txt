Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,
There stood a long cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode,
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell.


(Chorus)
Go Go
Go Johnny Go Go (x4)
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
Go sit beneath a tree by the railroad track
Oh the engineers would see him sittin in the shade,
Strummin with the rhythm that the drivers made,
People passin' by they would stop and say
"Oh my but that little country boy can play"

(Chorus)

His momma told him "some day you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people comin' from miles around,
To hear you play your music till the sun go down,
Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin 
'Johnny B. Goode' tonight"

(Chorus)
