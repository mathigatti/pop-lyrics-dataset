I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you cam here it won't be the same now I'm telling you
You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replacing ev'ry thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now I'm telling you
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe some day
Who knows baby
You may comfort me
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows baby
You may comfort me
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start I'm making sure that I'm not late
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you
