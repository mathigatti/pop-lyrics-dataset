In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed the sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines


So we sailed up to the sun
'Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!
We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play!

We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!
We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!

(Full steam ahead, Mr. Boatswain!
Full steam ahead!
Full steam ahead it is, Sgt!
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye sir, aye-aye
Captain! Captain!)

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease!)
Everyone of us (everyone of us!) has all we need
(has all we need!)
Sky of blue (sky of blue!) and sea of green (sea of green!)
In our yellow (In our yellow!) submarine!
(Submarine, ha, ha!)

We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!
We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!

We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!
We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!
