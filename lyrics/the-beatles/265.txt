One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun


Some day you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

Tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
