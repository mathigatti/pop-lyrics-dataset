Whoa-ho, whoa-ho
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home


Come on, I'm on my way
'Cos I'm gonna see my baby today
I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say to her

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

Come on, if you please
I've got no time for trivialities
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me tonight

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

When I'm getting home tonight, I'm gonna hold her tight
I'm gonna love her till the cows come home
I bet I'll love her more
Till I walk out that door - again

Come on, let me through
I've got so many things I've got to do
I've got no business being here with you this way

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home.
