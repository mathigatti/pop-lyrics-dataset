For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight
On trampoline.


The Hendersons will all be there.
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair,
What a scene.

Over men and horses, hoops and garters,
Lastly, through a hog's head of real fire;
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world.

The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday
At Bishop's Gate.

The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring.
Don't be late!

Misters K and H assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And, of course, Henry the horse dances the waltz.

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K performs his tricks
Without a sound

And Mr. H will demonstrate;
Ten somersets he'll undertake
On solid ground.

Having been some days in preparation.
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill.
