Little child, little child
Little child won't you dance with me
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me


Little child, little child
Little child won't you dance with me
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

If you want someone to make you feel so fine
Then we'll have some fun when you're mine
So come on, come on, come on

Little child, little child
Little child won't you dance with me
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me, wow

When you're by my side you're the only one
Don't you run and hide just come on, come on
So come on, come on, come on

Little child, little child
Little child won't you dance with me
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me oh, yeah
Baby take a chance with me oh, yeah
Baby take a chance with me oh, yeah
