Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away.
That's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.


Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey.
Wo, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam.
I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation,
Oh, for the old folks at home.

Ah-oh-oh!

Oh, my my!

Well, way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey.
Wo, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam.
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation,
And for the old folks at home.

All the world is sad and dreary,
Ev'rywhere I roam.
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary,
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home.
