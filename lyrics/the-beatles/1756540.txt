[Chorus]

My gal is red hot
Your gal ain't doodly squat
Yeah, my gal is red hot
Your gal ain't doodly squat
Well, she ain't got no money
But man, she's a-really got a lot


Well, I got a gal, six feet four
Sleeps in the kitchen with her feet out the door, but

[Chorus and guitar solo]

Well, she walks all night, talks all day
She's the kinda woman who'll have her way, but

[Chorus and piano solo]

Well, she's the kinda woman who louds around
Spreadin' my business all over town, but

[Chorus and guitar solo]

Well, she's a one man's woman, that's what I like
But I wish she wasn't gonna change her mind everynight, but

[Chorus]
