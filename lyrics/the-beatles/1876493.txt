Heavenly, heavenly,
That's what you are to me
A guiding light, in the night
For only me to see


Your sweet lips, your lovely eyes
Hold the key to paradise
A guiding star, that's what you are
So heavenly, for only me

(Heavenly) I feel your tender touch
(Heavenly) I need you oh so much
(Heavenly) Are the things you do
(Heavenly) I'm so in love with you
(Heavenly) Was the way you smile
(Heavenly) As you walk down the isle
Heaven only knows what you mean to me

Heavenly, heavenly
That's what you are to me
A guiding light, in the night
For only me to see

(Heavenly) Is your tender touch
(Heavenly) I need you oh so much
(Heavenly) Are the things you do
(Heavenly) I'm so in love with you
(Heavenly) Was the way you smile
(Heavenly) As you walked down the Isle
Heaven only knows what you mean to me

Heavenly, Heavenly
That's what you are to me
A guiding light, in the night
For only me, so heavenly (heavenly).
