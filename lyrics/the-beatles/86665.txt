I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches, but I sure
Got a long way to go


I'm an ol' poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
I'm an ol' poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
I'll never be happy, cause everything I've
Ever did was wrong

Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please, don't shake my tree
Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please, don't mess around my tree
I got news for you, baby
Leave me here in misery

Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs

I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches, but I sure
Got a long way to go
