Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la


It's not the way you smile
That touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss
That tears me apart

Wo ho, many many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
Can't help myself
Cause baby it's you
Sha la la la la la la
Baby it's you
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la

You should hear what they say about you
Cheat! Cheat! Sha la la la la
They say, they say you never, never ever been true
Cheat! Cheat!

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do? Then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
Cause baby it's you
Sha la la la la la la
Baby it's you
Sha la la la la la la

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do? And it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
Cause baby it's you
Sha la la la la la la
Baby it's you
Sha la la la la la la
Don't leave me all alone
Come home
