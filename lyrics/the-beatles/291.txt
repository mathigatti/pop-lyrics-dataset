One, two, three, four
Can I have a little more
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
I love you
A, B, C, D
Can I bring my friend to tea
E, F, G, H, I, J
I love you


Bom bom bom bom-pa bom
Sail the ship bom-pa bom
Chop the tree bom-pa bom
Skip the rope bom-pa bom
Look at me

All together now, all together now
All together now, all together now
Black, white, green, red
Can I take my friend to bed
Pink, brown, yellow, orange, and blue
I love you

All together now, all together now
All together now, all together now
Bom bom bom bom-pa bom
Sail the ship bom-pa bom
Chop the tree bom-pa bom
Skip the rope bom-pa bom
Look at me

All together now, all together now
All together now, all together now
All together now, all together now, all together now
All together now, all together now
All together now!
