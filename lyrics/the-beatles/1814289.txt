Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night
Its only right
To think about the girl you love
And hold her tight
So happy together
If I should call you up
Invest a dime
And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be
So very fine
So happy together


I cant see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you are with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

Me and you
And you and me
No matter how they toss the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together

I cant see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you are with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

Me and you
And you and me
No matter how they toss the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together

Me and you
And you and me
No matter how they toss the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together

So happy together
How is the weather?
So happy together
We are happy together
So happy together
Happy together
So happy together
So happy together
