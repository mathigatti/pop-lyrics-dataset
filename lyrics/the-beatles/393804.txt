Please lock me away, and don't allow the day here
Inside where i hide with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say.
I won't stay in a world without love.


Birds sing out of tune and rain drops hide the moon
I'm ok, here i'll stay with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say.
I won't stay in a world without love.

So i wait and in a while i will see my true love smile
She may come, i know not when, when she does
I'll know, so baby until then, lock me away
And don't allow the day here.
Inside where i hide with my loneliness

I don't care what they say.
I won't stay in a world without love.
