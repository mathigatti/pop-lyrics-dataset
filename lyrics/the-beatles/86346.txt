Well, I got a woman
Way across town,
She's good to me,
O-oh, yeah.


Say I got a woman
Way across town,
She's good to me.
Oh, yeah.

She gives me money
Everytime I need, yes.
You know, she's the kind of
Friend indeed.

Say I got a woman
Way across town,
She's good to me
O-oh, yeah.

She says she loves me
Early in the morning,
Just for me.
O-oh yeah.

She says she loves me
Early in the morning
Just for me,
Oh yeah.

She says she loves me
Just for me, yeah.
You know, she loves me,
So tenderly.

I got a woman
Way across town,
She's good to me,
Oh, yeah. Awww!

[Instrumental]

She says she loves me
All day and night
Never grumbles or fusses,
She just treats me right.
Never running in the streets,
Leaving me alone.
She's knows a woman's place
Is right back there hanging by the home.

Well, I got a woman
Way across town
She's good to me,
Oh yeah.

Well, I've got a woman,
Way across town,
She's good to me,
Oh, yeah.

Well, she's my baby
'Cos she's understands
I-i-i, I-i-i, I'm her lover man.

I got a woman
Way across town,
She's good to me
O-oh, yeah.

A Don't ya know she's alright
A Don't ya know she's alright

I got a woman
Way across town,
She's good to me
Oh-o-oh, yeah.
