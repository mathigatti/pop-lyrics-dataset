I've just seen a face, I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me and I want all the world to see we've met
Mm mm


Had it been another day, I might have looked the other ways and
I'd have never been aware, but as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Da da

Falling, yes, I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again

I have never known the like of this, I've been alone and I have
Missed things and kept out of sight for other girl we're never quite like this
Da da

Falling, yes, I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again

Falling, yes, I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again

I've just seen a face, I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me and I want all the world to see we've met
Mm mm da da

Falling, yes, I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again

Falling, yes, I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again

Oh, falling, yes, I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again
