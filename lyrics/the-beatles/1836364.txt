Sweetheart if you should stray a million miles away
I'll always be in love with you
And though you'll find more bliss in someone else's kiss
I'll always be in love with you.


I can't do any more i've tried so hard to please
But let me thank you for such tender memories
I wish you happiness as for me sweetheart
I guess i'll always be in love with you.

(i'll always be in love with you)

I can't do any more i've tried so hard to please
But let me thank you for such tender memories
I wish you happiness as for me sweetheart
I guess i'll always be in love with you...
