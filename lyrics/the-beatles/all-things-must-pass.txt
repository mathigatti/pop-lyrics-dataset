Sunrise doesn't last all morning,
A cloudburst doesn't last all day.
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning.
It's not always been this grey.


All things must pass,
All things must pass away.

Sunset doesn't last all evening,
A mind can blow those clouds away.
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving.
It has not always been this grey.

All things must pass,
All things must pass away.

All things must pass
None of life's strings can last.
So i must be on my way,
Face another day.

Darkness only stays at nighttime,
In the morning it will fade away.
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time.
It's not always
Will to be this grey.

All things must pass,
All things must pass away.
All things must pass,
All things must pass away.
