If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me


You're quite contend to be bad
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me

I dont think it's funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamond and rings

You think I'm soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
It's not so funny
When you know what money can bring

You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two

If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me

You're quite contend to be bad
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
Ah rock on anybody

You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two

If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me

You're quite contend to be bad
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
