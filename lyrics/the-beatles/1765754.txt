In the night, there are sights to be seen
Stars like Jewels on the Crown of a Queen
But the only sight I wanna view
Is that wonderful Picture of you


On a Streetcar, or in the Caf
All of the evening, and most of the day
My mind is in a maze what can I do?
I still see that picture of you

It was last Summer, I fell in love
My heart told me what to do
I saw you there on the crest of a hill
An I took a little picture of you

Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you went my Heart, my Love and my Life
I didnt know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you

Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you, went my Heart, my Love and my Life
I didnt know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you,
Im left with a picture of, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you
