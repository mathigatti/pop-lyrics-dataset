Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love


I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
If it makes you feel all right
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel all right
'Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I've got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No, no, no, no

Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No, no, no, no

Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
Ooh, can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love, no
