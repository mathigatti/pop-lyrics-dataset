Lend me your comb, 
it's time to go home. 
I got to go past, 
my hair is a mess 
Your mammie will scold,
your pappie will shout. 
Unless we come in 
the way we went out. 
Kissing you was fun honey 
but thanks for the date. 
But I must come to run honey, 
but you know baby it's getting late. 
Just wait till I say:
my darling, 
lend me your comb.
We got to go home. 
Kissing you was fun honey
but thanks for the date. 
But I must come to run, honey.
but sugar, it's getting late. 
Just wait till I 
say: my darling, 
lend me your comb. 
We got to go home.
