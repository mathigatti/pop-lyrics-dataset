I get high when I see you go by
My, oh, my
When you sigh, my mind inside just flies
Butterflies


Why am I so shy
When I'm beside you?

It's only love
And that is all
Why should I feel
The way I do?
It's only love
And that is all
But it's so hard
Loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night
Just the sight of you makes night time bright
Very bright

Haven't I the right
To make it up, girl?

It's only love
And that is all
Why should I feel
The way I do?
It's only love
And that is all,
But it's so hard
Loving you
Yes, it's to hard
Loving you
Loving you
