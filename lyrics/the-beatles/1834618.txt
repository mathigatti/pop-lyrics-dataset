Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
All right now, hey-hey, all right


See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
All right now, now, now, hey-hey, hey-hey

See the girl with the red dress on
She can do the birdland all night long
Yeah-yeah, what I say, all right

Tell your mama, tell your pa
I'm gonna send you back to arkansas
Oh, yes, ma'am. You don't do right
Don't do right

When you see me in misery
Come on, baby, see about me
Now, yeah-yeah, all right
All right, aw, play it, boy

Well, tell me what I say, yeah
Tell me what I say, right now
Tell me what I say
