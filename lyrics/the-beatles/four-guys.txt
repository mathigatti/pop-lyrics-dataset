We were four guys
I met Paul, I said do you wanna' join me band, ya know?
Then George joined, and Then Ringo joined
We were just a band that made it very, very big, that's all


Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Band on the run!
Long time ago when we was the band on the run

If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away
To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day

(If we ever get out of here)

Back when income tax was all we had
But it's all over now baby blue

Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Band on the run!
Long time ago when we was the band on the run

(Take you away
Take you away)

If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away
To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day
If I ever get out of here
(If we ever get out of here)

Back when income tax was all we had
And you've really got a hold on me

Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Band on the run!
Long time ago when we was the band on the run
