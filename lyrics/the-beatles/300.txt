We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people
Who hide themselves behind a wall
Of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
When it's far too late
When they pass away


We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it
To try our best to hold it there
(With our love)
With our love we could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realise its all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you
And without you

We were talking
About the love thats gone so cold
And the people
Who gain the world and lose their soul
They dont know
They cant see
Are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see
We're all one and life flows on
Within you and without you
