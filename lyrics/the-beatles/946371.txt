My tears are fallin', 'cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's something that I've gotta say


Take good care of my baby
Please, don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do-o-o-o
Aww, take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Now don't you ever make her cry-y-y-y
Just let your love surround her
Paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky

Once upon a time that little girl was mine
If I'd been true, I know she'd never be with you

So, take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Well, take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby
