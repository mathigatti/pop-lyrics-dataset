Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me. (X2)


Well, I gave you everything I had,
But you left me sittin' on my own.
Did you have to treat me oh, so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me. (X2)

If it's somethin' that I've said or done,
Tell me what and I'll apologize.
If you don't, I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me. (X2)

Well, I'm beggin' on my bended knees,
If you'll only listen to my pleas.
If there's anythin' I can do
'Cause I really can't stand it,
I'm so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me. (X2)
