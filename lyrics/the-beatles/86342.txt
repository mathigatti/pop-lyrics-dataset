How do you do
What you do to me?
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you


How do you do
What you do to me?
I'm feeling blue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven't a clue
You give me a feeling in my heart
Like an arrow piercing through it
I suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it?
