I'll be there to get you in a taxi, honey
Better be ready by half past eight
Now baby don't be late
I wanna be there when the band starts playing


Remember when we get there honey
New steps I'm gonna have them all
I'm gonna dance out of both my shoes
When they play those general blues
Tomorrow night at the darktown strutters' ball

I'll be there to get you in a taxi, honey
Better be ready by half past eight
Now baby don't be late
I wanna be there when the band starts playing

Remember when we get there honey
New steps I'm gonna have them all
I'm gonna dance out of both my shoes
When they play those general blues
Tomorrow night at the darktown strutters' ball
