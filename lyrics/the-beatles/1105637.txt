Falling in love again, I never wanted to
What am I to do, I can't help it.
Love has always been my game, play it how I may
I was made that way, can't help it.


Men cluster to me like moths around a flame,
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame
Falling in love again, I never wanted to
What am I to do, I can't help it.

Men cluster to me like moths around a flame,
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame
Falling in love again, I never wanted to
