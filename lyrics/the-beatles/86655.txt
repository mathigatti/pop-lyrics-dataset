I-I saw a girl in my dreams
and so it seems
that I will love her.
Oh you, you are that girl
in my dreams
and so it seems
that I will love you.
And I waited for your kiss,
waited for the bliss
like dreamers do.
And I-I-I-I,
oh I'll be there, yeah
waiting for you you you you you.
You, you came just one dream ago
and now I know that I will love you.
I knew when you first said hello
that's how I know
that I will love you.
And I-I-I waited for your kiss,
waited for the bliss
like dreamers do.
And I-I-I-I,
oh I'll be there, yeah,
waiting for you you you you you.
You, you came just one dream ago
and now I know that I will love you.
Oh I knew when you first said hello
that's how I know
that I will love you.
And I waited for your kiss,
waited for the bliss
like dreamers do,
oh like dreamers do,
like dreamers do.
