It's getting better all the time!

I used to get mad at my school 
(No, I can't complain!)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool 
(No, I can't complain!)
You're holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules
(Fool, you fool!)


I've got to admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
(It can't get more worse!)
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I've got to admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
(It can't get more worse)
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Better! Better! Better!
It's getting better all the time
Better! Better! Better!

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can

I admit it's getting better
A little better all the time 
(It can't get more worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Better! Better! Better!

It's getting better all the time
Better! Better! Better!
Getting so much better all the time
