Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson Arizona
For some California grass


Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, Jo Jo!

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, Jo Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, Loretta!

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, Loretta
Your mommy is waiting for you
Wearing her high hill shoes, and her low neck sweater
Get Back home Loretta

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
