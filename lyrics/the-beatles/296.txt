She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do
Oh, yeah


She's well acquainted with the touch
Of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd
With the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes
While his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife
Which he ate and donated
To the National Trust

I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Happiness is a warm gun
(Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, momma
(Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot)

When I hold you in my arms (oh, yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger (oh, yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm (oh, yeah)
Because

(Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Is a warm gun, momma
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is
(Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm, yes it is
Gun
(Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Well don't you know that happiness
Is a warm gun, momma?
(Happiness is a warm gun, yeah)
