Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet


Who finds the money
When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was Heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace

See how they run

Lady Madonna
Baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

Lady Madonna
Lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is neverending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending

See how they run

Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
