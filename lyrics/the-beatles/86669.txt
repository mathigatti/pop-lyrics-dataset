Mr. Moonlight
You came to me
One summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love


And now she is mine
I think you're fine
'Cause we love you
Mr. Moonlight

Mr. Moonlight
Come again please
Here I am on my knees
Beggin' if you please

And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you
Mr. Moonlight

And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you
Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight
