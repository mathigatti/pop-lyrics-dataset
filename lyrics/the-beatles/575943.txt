Brian : Before we hear another song fellows, there are a few things I'd like to ask you.  First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?
Paul  : Get so tired now, get a bit a lonely now.
John  : Rhythm, who's that? Blues.
Paul  : I don't think so, really. No. Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubish about you, which you get often.
Brian : I agree with that.  I've had a divorce and a half a dozen kids.
Brian : Now what do you, uh, well, I mean doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that stuff?
John  : No, she knows I'm not divorced, 'cause I keep seeing her every day, see?
Brian : Yeah, that's my point, but what about the simpler things of life. Like, uh...
Paul  : Like riding a bus.
Brian : yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you can find?
Paul  : Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things.
John  : We go to certain ones.
George: And we go to ones where the people there are so snoby their the type who pretend they don't know us, we have a good time, 'cause they pretend that don't know us.
Paul  : John's Cath.
Brian : Yeah, that figures.
Paul  : See, John's Cath.? Social comment that, you know? It is.
