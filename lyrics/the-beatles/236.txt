I should have known better
With a girl like you.
That I would love everything
That you do
And I do,
Hey, hey, hey,
And I do.


Whoa, oh, I never realized
What a kiss could be.
This could only happen to me.
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you,
Oh,
You're gonna say you love me too,
Oh,
And when I ask you to be mine,
You're gonna say you love me too

So, oh, I should have realized
A lot of things before.
If this is love
You've gotta give me more.
Give me more,
Hey, hey, hey,
Give me more.

Whoa, oh, I never realized
What a kiss could be.
This could only happen to me.
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you,
Oh,
You're gonna say you love me too,
Oh,
And when I ask you to be mine,
You're gonna say you love me too

You love me too.
You love me too.
You love me too.
