Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling


You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way, hey
