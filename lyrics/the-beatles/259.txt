A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine


I dream of your
First kiss and then
I feel upon
My lips again

A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Oh, I will return
Yes, I will return
I'll come back
For the honey and you

Yours was the kiss
That awoke my heart
There lingers still
Though we're far apart

That taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

I will return
Yes, I will return
I'll come back
(He'll come back)
For the honey
(For the honey)
And you
