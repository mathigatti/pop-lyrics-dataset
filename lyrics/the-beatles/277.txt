That boy took my love away
He'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again


That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh, and this boy
Would be happy
Just to love you
But oh, my, that boy
Won't be happy
'Til he's seen you cry

This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

This boy
This boy
This boy
