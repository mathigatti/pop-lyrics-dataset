I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah (that's right)
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no
Yeah. Yeah! I've got a feeling, yeah!


Oh, please, believe me, I'd hate to miss the train
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
And if you leave me I won't be late again
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
Yeah, yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah
I got a feeling

All these years, I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you

I've got a feeling that keeps me on my toes
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Yeah. Yeah! I've got a feeling, yeah!

Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody had a good time
Ev'rybody had a wet dream
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Ev'rybody had a good year
Ev'rybody let their hair down
Ev'rybody pulled their socks up (yeah)
Ev'rybody put their foot down
Oh, yeah! Yeah! Wohoo!

(Oh, my soul, it's so hard)
