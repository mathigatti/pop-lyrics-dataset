Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down


Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oooh, she does, yes, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
She do me, yes, she does

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last?
I'ts a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

And from the first time that she really done me
Oooh, she done me, she done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Ooh, she done me, she done me good

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down
