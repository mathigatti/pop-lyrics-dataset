Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, it's such a joy
Come on, it's such a joy
Come on, let's take it easy
Come on, let's take it easy


Take it easy
Take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide
Except for me and my monkey

The deeper you go
The higher you fly
The higher you fly
The deeper you go
So come on, come on

Come on, it's such a joy
Come on, it's such a joy
Come on, let's make it easy
Come on, let's make it easy

Take it easy
Take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide
Except for me and my monkey

(Come on, come on, come on)

Your inside is out
When your outside is in
Your outside it in
When your inside it out
So come on, come on
