...then there's this Welsh rarebit wearing some brown underpants...
...about the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire.
Every one of them knew that as time went by they'd get a little bit older and little bit slower but.. It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always…

Umpteen times your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving....
Intended to die hateful Ottoman...
Long gone through...
I've got to say, irritably and...
Floors, hard enough to put on
Per day's MD in our district
There was not really enough light to get down
and ultimately slumped down
Suddenly...

They may stop the funding...
Place your bets. The original
Afraid she'll die
Great colors for the season....

I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing..
A business deal falls through...
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives....

People right, people right, right, right, right

I've missed all that
It makes me a few days late compared with, wow!
And weird stuff like that...

Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rogue doctors have bought this specimen
I have nobody's short cuts, aha...

They are standing still

John Lennon:
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to my son
He really can try, as they do
To find function...
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low
And his hive high, and his eyes were low
Alright!

It was on fire
And his glasses were the same
This thing knows if it was tinted
But you know it isn't.
To me it is..

John Lennon:
So the wife called me
And we'd better go see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it...
Yellow underclothes
So, any road
We went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all. So I said I'd marry, join the fucking Navy and went to sea

In my broken chair
My wings are broken and so is my hair
I am not in the mood for whirling

How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming
....only to find the night-watchmen unaware of his presence in the building.

Industry allows financial imbalance
Thrusting it between his schoulder blades

Take this brother may it serve you well.

Yoko Ono:
Maybe it's nothing

John Lennon:
What? What? Oh...

Yoko Ono:
Maybe even then, impervious in London

John Lennon:
The girl…

Yoko Ono:
Could be a difficult thing...
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much like being naked

John Lennon:
It's alright (nine times)

Yoko Ono:
If, you become naked

NFL Crowd:
Block that kick!
