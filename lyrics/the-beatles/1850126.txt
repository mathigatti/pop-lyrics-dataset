Well I know you heard of Suzie Q.
I know you heard of the chicken too
I know you heard of the cha-cha too
But the walk is dance that you can do


You just walk
You just walk
Oh, you walk
Yes, you walk
Yeah, you walk
That's the walk.


Well I know you heard of the Texas hop
I know heard of the old foxtrot
But when you do the walk, you're do it in style
You just shake your hips and close your eyes.

And then you walk
Yeah, you walk
And you walk
Do the walk
Ah, you walk
Yes, you walk
Do the walk!

(Instrumental break)

Well I know you heard of the old mambo
And I know you heard of the old tango
But when you do the walk you stand in close
And don't step on your partners toes

You just walk
Yeah, you walk
Well, you walk
Yes, you walk
Ah, you walk
That's the walk

Now if you don't know what it's all about
Come to me and I'll show you how
We'll do it fast, we'll do it slow
Then you'll know the walk everywhere you go.

You just walk
And you walk
Now you walk
It's called the walk
You wanna walk

That's the walk
That's the walk
(repeat 'til fade)
