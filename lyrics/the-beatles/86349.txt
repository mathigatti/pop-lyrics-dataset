All thru' the day I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
All thru' the night I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Ev'ryone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All thru' the day I me mine


I-I me-me mine, I-I me-me mine
I-I me-me mine, I-I me-me mine
All I can hear I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears I me mine, I me mine, I me mine

No-one's frightened of playing it, ev'ryone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All thru' the day I me mine
I-I me-me mine, I-I me-me mine
I-I me-me mine, I-I me-me mine

All I can hear I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it, ev'ryone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All thru' your life I me mine
