Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
All the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight


I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone

I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S., back in the U.S., back in the U.S.S.R.!

Well these Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the west behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my mi-ind!

Oh, Come on!

I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

Well, these Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the west behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my mi-ind!

Oh, show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm

I'm back in the U.S.S.R. Hey!
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R
Oh! Let me tell you, honey!
Hey I'm back!
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
Hey! Sing it with me!
Heeeeeey! Back in the U.S.S.R
