I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby


I don't want you,
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter. Tighter.

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me please, hold me squezee, hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me
