Three cool cats, 
three cool cats 
are coming up in a beat up car,
spitting up a lift of candy bar 
talking on about how sharp they are.
Three cool cats. 
Three cool chicks 
are walking down the street
swinging their hips, 
splitting up a bag of potatoe chips 
I think cool cats really did flip. 
Three cool chicks 
Three cool chicks. 
Well up came that first cool cat,
he said: man look at that. 
Man, do you see what I see? 
Well I want that middle chick 
I want that little chick. 
Hey man save once chick for me.
Well three cool chicks. 
Three cool chicks. 
Well they love like 
angels from up above 
and three cool cats 
really fell in love. 
But three cool chicks 
made three fools out of 
three cool cats. 
Three cool cats. 
Well up came that first cool cat,
he said: man look at that. 
man do you see what I see?

I want that little chick. 
Hey man, save one chick for me.
Three cool chicks. 
Three cool chicks. 
They look like 
angels from up above
and three cool cats 
really fell in love. 
And three cool chicks 
made three fools out of 
three cool cats. 
Three cool cats. 
Three cool cats. 
Three cool cats.
