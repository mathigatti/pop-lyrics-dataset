If you're listening to this song,
You may think the cords are going wrong.
But they're not
We just wrote it like that


When you're listening late at night,
You may think the bands are not quite right,
But they are,
They just play it like that

It doesn't really matter what chords I play,
What words I say,
Or time of day it is
As it's only a northern song

*music*

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear,
Or how I pur
Or if my hair is brown
When it's only a northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key,
You're correct,
There's nobody there

And it told you there's no one there

*music*
