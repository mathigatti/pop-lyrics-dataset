Late yesterday night, I saw a light shine from a window,
and as I looked again, your face came into sight.
I couldn't walk on until you'd gone from your window.
I had to make you mine, I knew you were the one.
Oh, I would be glad just to have a love like that,
oh, I would be true and I'd live my life for you.
So meet me tonight, just where the light shines from a window,
and as I take your hand, say that you'll be mine tonight.
Oh, I would be glad just to have a love like that,
