Sheepdog
Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doing it again


Somekind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

Childlike
No one understands
Jack Knife
In his sweaty hands

Somekind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

Big man walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Somekind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!
