You don't need anybody to hold you,
Here I stand with my arms open wide,
Give me love and remember what I told you -
I'll keep you satisfied.


You don't need anybody to kiss you,
Every day I'll be here by your side,
Don't go away, I'm afraid that I might miss you -
I'll keep you satisfied.

You can always get a simple thing like love anytime,
But it's different with a boy like me and a love like mine.

So believe everything that I told you,
And agree that with me by your side,
You don't need anybody to hold you -
I'll keep you satisfied.
