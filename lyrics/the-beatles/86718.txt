I saw her standing on the corner, 
a yellow ribbon in her hair. 
I couldn't stop myself from calling:
look a-there, look a-there, 
look a-there, look a-there. 
Young Blood, Young Blood, Young Blood. 
I can't get you out of my mind. 
I took one look and I was fractured,
I tried to walk but I was lame. 
I tried to talk but I just stuttered:
well what's your name, what's your name, 
well what's your name, what's your name. 
Young Blood, Young Blood, Young Blood. 
I can't get you out of my mind. 
A crazy stop, she was the top, 
I tried to follow her all the way home.
Things went bad, I met her dad 
he said: you'd better leave my daughter alone.
Well I tried to 
I saw the rising of the sun,
and all along my heart was falling,
while you're the one, you're the one, 
while you're the one, you're the one, 
Young Blood, Young Blood, Young Blood. 
I can't get you out of my mind.
