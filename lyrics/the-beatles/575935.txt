If you leave me, baby
I don't know what I'll do
I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you


Take out some insurance on me, baby
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die

Oh, if you want me, baby
You've gotta come to me
Mm, I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me

Take out some insurance on me, baby
Ooh, some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die

Well, if you want me, baby
Mm, you've gotta come to me
I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me

Take out some insurance on me, baby
Mm, some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die

Well, if you leave me, baby
I don't know what I'll do
I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you

Take out some insurance on me, baby
Mm, some God damned insurance on me, baby
If you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die
