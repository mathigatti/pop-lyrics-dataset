India, India,   take me to your heart 
Reveal your ancient mysteries to me 
I'm searchin' for an answer, but somewhere deep inside 
I know I'll never find it here - it's already in my mind 
 
India, India, listen to my plea 
Sit here at your feet so please don't leave 
I'm waiting by the river but somewhere in my mind 
I left my heart in England with the girl I left behind 
 
I've got to follow my heart wherever it takes me 
I've got to follow my heart wherever it calls to me 
I've got to follow my heart and my heart is going home 
 
pause 
 
India, India, listen to my plea 
I sit here at your feet so patiently 
I'm waiting by the river but somewhere in my mind 
I left my heart in England with the girl I left behind 


I've got to Follow my heart wherever it takes me 
I've got to follow my heart wherever it calls to me 
I've got to follow my heart and my heart is going home
