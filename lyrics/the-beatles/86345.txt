I forgot to remember to forget her,
I can't seem to get her off my mind. 
I thought I'd never miss her, 
but I've found out somehow 
I think about her almost all the time.
Well the day she went away 
I made myself I promise 
that I'd soon forget we'd ever met. 
But something sure is wrong 
'cos I'm so blue and lonely: 
I forgot to remember to forget. 
Well the day she went away 
I made myself I promise 
that I'd soon forget we'd ever met.
But something sure is wrong 
'cos I'm so blue and lonely: 
I forgot to remember to forget.
