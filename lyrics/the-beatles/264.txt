I once had a girl
Or should I say
She once had me


She showed me her room
Isn't it good?
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine

We talked until two
And then she said
It's time for bed

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird has flown

So I lit a fire
Isn't it good?
Norwegian wood
