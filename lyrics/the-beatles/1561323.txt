Standin' in the garden, waitin' for the sun to shine
Hand my umbrella, with this dirt I wish she was mine
Everybody doves, think a thing; it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watchin' rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Standin' in the garden, waitin' for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Lookin' at the bench of next door neighbours
Cryin' to my mom, I'm tryin' to set sabors
Everybody's got to have something hard to grow
Well, instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son, and make you one
You gotta get out son, and make you run
Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry, though
Shoot big!
Shoot big!
Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big!
You gotta shoot big!
Until you shoot big
I can't stand
