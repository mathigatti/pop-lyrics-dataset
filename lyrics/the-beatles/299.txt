Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you
Julia


Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the Sun

Julia, Julia, morning Moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum, hum, hum, calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia
