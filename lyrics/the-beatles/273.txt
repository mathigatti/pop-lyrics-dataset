Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl, or I won't know where I am


You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man, that's the end, little girl

Well, you know that I'm a wicked guy and I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life trying just to make you toe the line

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man, that's the end, little girl

Let this be a sermon, I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined and I'd rather see you dead

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man, that's the end, little girl

I'd rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl or you won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man, that's the end, little girl

Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
