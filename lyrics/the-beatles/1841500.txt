Everybody's ever got somebody caring
Everybody's ever got somebody sharing
Everybody but me
Everybody is getting ready
Going Steady
But me
I stay home on Friday night
Go to bed at eight
On Saturday night I'm all alone
I don't have a date
Everybody's out romancing
Having fun and going dancing
everybody
Everybody but me
