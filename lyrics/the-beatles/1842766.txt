Lucky star shine on me,
Lucky star don't you see,
I need your light shining bright,
To win her love for me tonight.
Lucky star in the sky,
Don't let her love pass me,
No matter how near or far,
Won't you be my lucky star
(Ooh Ooh, I'm working on you,
I promise I'll be true)
Lucky star up above,
Please help me win my love,
Tell me what my chances are,
Won't you be my lucky star
(Ooh....Help me win)
