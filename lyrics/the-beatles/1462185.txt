Beautiful Delilah, sweet as apple pie
Always gets a second look from fellas passin' by
Every time you see her she's with a different guy
Beautiful Delilah, that's the reason why


The better don't allow me fool around with you
You are so tantalizing you just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah, dressed in the latest style
Swingin' like a pendulum, walkin' down the aisle
Deep romantic eyes, speak so low in miles
Maybe she will settle down and marry after a while

The better don't allow me fool around with you
You are so tantalizing you just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah, bathin' in the sun
An audience of 17, and notice not a one
Local Casanova who wouldn't be outdone
Let her steal his heart away, break it just for fun

The better don't allow me fool around with you
You are so tantalizing you just can't be trueee
