I'm gonna tell aunt mary 'bout uncle john
He said he had the misery but he got a lot of fun
Baby, yeah now baby
Woo baby, some fun tonight


I saw uncle john with long tall sally
He saw aunt mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley
Oh, baby, yeah now baby
Woo baby, some fun tonight

Well long tall sally's built pretty sweet
She got everything that uncle john need
Baby, yeah now baby
Woo baby, some fun tonight

Well, we're gonna have some fun tonight

Everything's all right

Yeah, yeah, yeah
We're gonna have some fun tonight

Everything's all right
Have some fun tonight
Yeah, we'll have some fun
Some fun tonight
