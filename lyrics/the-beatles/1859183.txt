If you gotta make a fool of somebody
If you gotta make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me
I'm the one thatll worry, about you


If you gotta make a fool of somebody
If you gotta make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me
I am the one thatll love you, always true

Daytime or nightime, anytime at all
I'll rush to your side anytime you call
Just to be near you, you know
Anywhere I'll go
How could you hurt me so... oh

If you gotta make a fool of somebody
If you gotta make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me
I'm the one thatll worry, about you

Take it easy baby
Please don't hurt me
