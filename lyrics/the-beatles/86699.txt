Oh, oh
You've been good to me, you made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl, thank you, girl


I could tell the world, a thing or two about our love
I know little girl, only a fool would doubt our love
And all I gotta do is thank you, girl, thank you, girl

Thank you girl for loving me the way that you do (way that you do)
That's the kind of love that is too good to be true
And all I gotta do is thank you girl, thank you, girl

Oh, oh
You've been good to me, you made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you, girl, thank you, girl
Oh, oh
