Grow old along with me
The best is yet to be
When our time has come
We will be as one
God bless our love!
God bless our love!
Grow old along with me
Two branches of one tree
Face the setting Sun
When the day is done
God bless our love!
God bless our love!
Spending our lives together
Man and wife together
World without end!
World without end!
Grow old along with me
Whatever fate decrees
We will see it through
For our love is true
God bless our love!
God bless our love!
