I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly!
I'm crying!


Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

I am the egg man!
They are the egg men!
I am the walrus!
Goo goo goo joob!

Mister City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky!
See how they run!
I'm crying! I'm crying!
I'm crying! I'm crying!

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

I am the egg man!
They are the egg men!
I am the walrus!
Goo goo goo joob!

Sitting in an English garden waiting for the Sun
If the Sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

I am the egg man (now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (a poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
I am the walrus
Goo goo goo joob! (Good pity!)

Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying

Semolina Pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

I am the egg man!
They are the egg men!
I am the walrus!
Goo goo goo joob!
Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob! Joob!
