Wait oh yes, wait a minute mister postman
Wait, wait mister postman
(Mister postman look and see) oh, yeah
(If there's a letter in the bag for me)
Please please mister postman
(I've been waiting a long long time) oh, yeah
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)


There must be some word today
From my girlfriend so far away
Please mister postman look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me

I've been standing here waiting Mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card
Or just a letter
Saying she's returning home to me

Please mister postman
(Mister postman look and see) oh, yeah
(Is there a letter in your bag for me) Please, please mister postman
(I've been waiting a long long time) oh, yeah
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)

So many days you past me by
See the tears standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or letter

Mister Postman, look and see
Is there a letter in your bag for me
I've been waiting such a long long time
Since I heard from that girl of mine

You gotta, wait a minute wait a minute oh, yeah
Wait a minute wait a minute oh, yeah
You gotta, wait a minute wait a minute oh, yeah
(You gotta) check and see one more time for me

You gotta, wait a minute wait a minute oh, yeah
Wait a minute, wait a minute oh, yeah
Mister Postman, oh, yeah
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better

You gotta, wait a minute wait a minute oh, yeah
Wait a minute wait a minute oh, yeah
You gotta, wait a minute wait a minute oh, yeah
You gotta, wait a minute wait a minute oh, yeah
