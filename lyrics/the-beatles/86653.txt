You better leave my kitten all alone, 
you better leave my kitten all alone. 
But I told you big fat bulldog, 
you better leave her alone. 
You better leave my kitten all alone,
you better leave my kitten all alone. 
This dog is gonna get you 
if you don't leave her alone. 
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna hit you 
on the top of your head. 
That child is gonna miss you, 
you gonna wish that you were dead.
If you don't leave my kitten all alone.
Well I told you big fat bulldog, 
you better leave her alone. 
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna hit you 
on the top of your head. 
That girl is gonna miss you, 
you gonna wish that you were dead.
If you don't leave my kitten all alone, oh yeah.
Well I told you, big fat bulldog, 
you better leave her alone. 
Hey hey you better leave, you better leave,
you better leave, yeah you better leave, 
you better leave, oh you got to leave...
