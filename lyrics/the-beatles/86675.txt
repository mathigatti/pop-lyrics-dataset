My baby says she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909


I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knee
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

They've got my bag, run to the station
Railman says: You've got the the wrong location
They've got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

They've got my bag, run to the station
Railman says: You've got the the wrong location
They've got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 90
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 90
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 909

(Oh Danny Boy, the old summer is calling)
