One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you.
I'm hoping every day
I'm gonna hear you say.
You really make my dreams come true.


Can't you feel, when I'm holding you near
All the things I do
Show my love and I'm making it clear
One and one is two

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you.
I'm hoping every day
I'm gonna hear you say.
You really make my dreams come true.

Can't you see, I loved you from the start
Don't you love me too?
I love you, but you're breaking my heart
From wanting you

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you.
I'm hoping every day
I'm gonna hear you say.
You really make my dreams come true.

If you say that you're gonna be mine
Everything's alright
All the world would look so fine.

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you.
I'm hoping every day
I'm gonna hear you say.
You're really make my dreams
You're really make my dreams
You're really make my dreams come true.
