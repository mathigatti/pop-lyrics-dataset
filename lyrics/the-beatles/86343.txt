I call your name, but you're not there
Was I to blame, for being unfair
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night, I can't go on


Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not goin' (to) mayayake it
I'm not that kind of man
Oh, I can't sleep at night, but just the same
I never weep at night, I call your name

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not goin' (to) mayayake it
I'm not that kind of man
Oh, I can't sleep at night, but just the same
I never weep at night, I call your name
I call your name
I never weep at night, I call your name
