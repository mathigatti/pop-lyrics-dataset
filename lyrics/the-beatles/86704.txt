Running to and fro, 
hard working at the mill,
never failed at the mill, 
there come a rotten bill. 
Aw too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
for me to be involved again. 
Salesman talking to me, 
trying to run me up a creek,
Says you can buy it, go on try it,
you can pay me next week. 
Aw too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
for me to be involved again. 
Blonde hair, good-looking, 
trying to get me hooked and married 
Get a home, settle down by the book. 
Too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
for me to be involved again. 
Been to Yokohama, baby, 
fighting in the war, 
Army bunk, army chow, 
army clothes, army car. 
Too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
for me to be involved again. 
Same thing every day, 
getting up, going to school. 
No need for me complaining, 
my objection's overruled. 
Aw too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
for me to be involved again. 
Working in the filling station, 
too many tasks, 
Wipe the windows, check the oil,
check the tires, dollar gas? 
Aw too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
Don't want you by the race, 
get away and leave me.
