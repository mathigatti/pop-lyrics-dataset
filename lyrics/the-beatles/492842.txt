I've got something to tell you , I'm in love.
I've been longing to tell you, I'm in love.
You'll believe me, when I tell you, I'm in love with you.
You're my kind of girl,
you make me feel pround,
you make me want to shout aloud,
yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love.
Every night I can't sleep, thinking of you,
and every little thing that you do,
yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love.
Oh yeah, I'm sittin' on the top of the world,
I'm in love with a wonderful girl,
and I never felt so good before,
if this is love, give me more, more, more.
Every night I can't sleep, thinking of you,
and every little thing that you do,
yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love.
Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love, in love.
Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love.
