Rodney: That was, uh, a Little Richard number that, uh, the boys rather
like and I hope you liked it. Ooh! My Soul, and ooh my arms; we've,
we've just flown in from Manchester, here from London to, uh,
record this show. Well, it's, uh, it's good to see you again fellows,
in these, uh, foreign parts. How are you?


Paul: Very well, thank you.
John: Oh, great, yeah.
Ringo: Just fine.
Rodney: What are you doing anyway?
George: Uh, we're playing in Liverpool at the moment.  We've never been
there for months, you see, so...

Ringo: It's good to be back.
John: Yeah, it's great.
Rodney: Anybody over there like a request you can do right now.
George: Well, we'll do a request for everybody.
Paul: Yeah.
Rodney: Good. What do you suggest?
George: Uh, Don't Ever Change, one of the oldies.
