Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying


Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

That ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving

So play the game Existence to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
