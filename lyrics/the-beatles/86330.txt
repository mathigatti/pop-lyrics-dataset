I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it, does it mean you don't love me anymore?


I hear the clock a-ticking on the mantelshelf
See the hands a-moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me anymore?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's all right, I'm waiting here just waiting to hear
From you

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
