Martha my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation, please
Remember me,
Martha my love
Don't forget me
Martha my dear


Hold your head up, you silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you, silly girl

Take a good look around you
Take a good look and you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
For each other
Silly girl

(instrumental)

Hold your hand out, you silly girl
See what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to bit of what is all around you, silly girl

Martha my dear, you have always been my inspiration, please
Be good to me, Martha my love
Don't forget me, Martha my dear
