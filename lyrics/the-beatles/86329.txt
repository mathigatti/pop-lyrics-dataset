You never wear a suit of lace,
the powder's not on your face.
You're always wearing jeans
except on sunday.
So please don't ever change,
no don't you ever change.
I kind of like you
just the way you are.
You don't know the latest dance,
but when it's time to make romance
your kisses let me know
you're not a tomboy.
So please don't ever change,
no don't you ever change.
Promise you're always gonna be
as sweet as you are.
I love you when you're happy,
I love you when you're blue.
I love you when you're mad at me,
so how can I get tired of you?
A lots of other girls I've seen,
they know how to treat guys mean.
But you would rather die
than ever hurt me.
So please don't ever change,
no don't you ever change.
Just promise me you're always gonna be
as sweet as you are.
Please don't ever change,
don't you ever change.
Please don't ever change,
don't you ever change.
