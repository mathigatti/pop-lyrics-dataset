Crying, crying,
waiting, waiting, 
hoping, hoping, 
you'll come back, 
I just can't seem 
to get you off my mind.
Crying, crying, 
waiting, waiting, 
hoping, hoping, 
you'll come back. 
You're the one I love.
I think about you 
all the time. 
Crying, crying, 
tears keep a-falling
all night long. 
Waiting, waiting, 
it seems so useless, 
I know it's wrong 
to keep on... 
...crying, crying, 
waiting, waiting, 
hoping, hoping, 
you'll come back baby,
someday soon 
things will change
and you'll be mine. 
Crying, crying, 
tears keep a-falling
all night long. 
Waiting, waiting, 
it seems so useless, 
I know it's wrong 
to keep on... 
...crying, crying, 
waiting, waiting, 
hoping, hoping, 
you'll come back 
maybe someday soon, 
things will change 
and you'll be mine. 
Crying, crying, 
waiting, waiting, 
hoping, hoping.
