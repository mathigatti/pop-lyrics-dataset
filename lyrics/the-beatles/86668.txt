Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies
Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the Sun
Mother Nature's son
