Well I'm the sheik of araby,
Your love belongs to me.
Well at night where you're asleep,
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above
Will light our way to love.
You rule this world with me,
I'm the sheik of araby.
Well I'm the sheik of araby,
Your love belongs to me.
Oh at night where you're asleep,
Into your tent I'll creep.
The sun that shines above
Will light our way to love.
You rule this world with me,
I'm the sheik of araby.
Well I'm the sheik of araby,
Well I'm the sheik of araby, yeah.
