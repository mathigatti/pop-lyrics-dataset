It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone


Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we cried

But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we cried

I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we cried

I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we cried

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
