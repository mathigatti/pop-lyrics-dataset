She's little, she's my own Sheila
You're the pony tailed
It's so long just to just make you my own
How can I send the love this while


Never never no I don't believe Sheila
Oh babe, towards in sight
She little knows I'm trying Sheila
Now I'm gonna pony inside

Little Sheila go far a ride
And out of mind I wanna your pony inside,
Let me see your withstand to me
I love you Sheila, girl

She's just have lovely face such as
The Lady your lover's memorize
Was I having this world together
How can I send the love this while

She's just have lovely face such as
The Lady your lover's memorize
Was I having this world together
How can I send the love this while

Little she loves me such as mean to lover's memorize
Was I having the time with her together...
