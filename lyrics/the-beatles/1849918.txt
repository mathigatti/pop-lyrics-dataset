Maybelline why can't you be true
Oh maybelline
Why can't you be true
You done started doing the things
You use to do


As i was motivating over the hill
Saw maybelline in a coup deville
A cadillac rolling on old glen road
Nothing out run my v-8 ford
A cadillac doing about 95
It was bumper to bumper side to side

(Chorus)

Maybelline
Why can't you be true
Oh maybelline
Why can't you be true
You done started back doing the things
You use to do

A cadillac pulled up to 104
Before it got hot it would do no more
It done got cloudy and started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passing lane
A rain water blowing all under my hood
I new that was doing my motor good

(Chorus)

(Solo)

(Chorus)

The water cooled down the heat went down
But under the hood the highway sound
Cadillac sat like a towing lane
110 a half a mile ahead
Cadillac look like it was standing still
I caught maybelline at the top of the hill

(Chorus)

(Solo)
