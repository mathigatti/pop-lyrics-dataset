Though you've gone away this morning you'll be back again tonight,
Telling me there'll be no next time if I just don't treat you right,
You'll never leave and you know it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.


You've tried before to leave me but you never had the nerve,
To walk out and makee me lonely which is all that I deserve,
You'll never leave and you know it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

I really do and it's nice when you believe me if you leave me,

I will follow you and bring you back where you belong,
'Cause I couldn't really stand it I admit that I was wrong,
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

I really do and it's nice when you believe me if you leave me,

I will follow you and bring you back where you belong,
'Cause I couldn't really stand it I admit that I was wrong,
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.
