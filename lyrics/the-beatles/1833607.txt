Well I woke up late this morning
My head was in the whirl
Only when I realized
I lost my little girl
Oh oh oh oh


Well her clothes were not expensive
Her hair
Didn't always curl
I don't know why I loved her
But I loved my little girl
Oh oh oh oh

Well gather round people
Let me tell you the story
The very first song I wrote

Well gather round people
Let me tell you the story
The very first song I wrote

Well I woke up late this morning
My head was in the whirl
Only when I realized
I lost my little girl
Oh oh oh oh
