You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again


'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again

This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I've got a big surprise

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again

This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I want to go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you

You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
