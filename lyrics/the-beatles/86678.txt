Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too damn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they had a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't blues it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks are dancin' got all shook up
And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't blues it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to gear a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can gear some of that
Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't blues it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
