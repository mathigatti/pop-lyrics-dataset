Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl


Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Please, please me, oh yeah, like I please you

You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say, love?

Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Please, please me, oh yeah, like I please you

I don't want to sound complaining, but you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you, it's so hard to reason with you
Oh yeah, why do you make me blue?

Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl

Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Please, please me, oh yeah, like I please you

Me, whoa yeah, like I please you
Me, whoa yeah, like I please you
Me, whoa yeah, like I please you
