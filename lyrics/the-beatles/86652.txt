We've been friends for oh so long, 
I won't let you share what's mine. 
When you mess with the girl I love, 
it's time to draw the line. 
Keep your hands off my baby. 
Ain't a-gonna tell you 
one more time. 
So keep your hands off my baby,
for it's gonna do you in: 
that girl is mine. 
I don't mind if you lend my clothes,
...much 
There is something that you can't say.
There's one thing you don't touch. 
Keep your hands off my baby. 
Ain't a-gonna tell you 
one more time. 
So keep your hands off my baby,
for it's really gonna do you in: 
that girl is mine. 
Keep your hands off my baby.
Ain't a-gonna tell you 
one more time. 
So keep your hands off my baby,
for it's really gonna do you in: 
that girl is mine. 
Oh keep your hands off my baby,
she's mine. 
Keep your hands off my baby.
You'd better watch your step now
for it's really gonna do you in: 
that girl is mine
