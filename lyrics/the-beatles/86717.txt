Well darling all the night 
You'll be mine and I know 
You'll be mine 
Till you die 
You'll be mine 
And so all the night
You'll be mine 
You'll be mine 
And the stars 
Always shine 
You'll be mine 
Oh my darling, when you burnt
that toast the other morning 
I, I looked into you eyes and 
I could see that National Health eyeball
and I love you, like I've never done, 
like I've never done before! 
Oh darling 
In your eyes 
And you'll be mine
You will be mine 
You'll be mine 
At the star and so 
You'll be mine
