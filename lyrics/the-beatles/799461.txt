Since we kiss I never knew the thrills I could be tasted
Since we kiss I never knew the years that I have wasted
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by
I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why that's took a long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life


Oh don't you know that until we touch I never knew that touch was worth revealing
Until we touch I never knew my heart was really beating
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why that's took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life

Oh where you've been, where you've been

Now don't you know I was waiting
For you to come by
I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why that's took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life

Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was feeling blue
Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was needing you
Oh where you've been, where you've been
Where you've been
Darling where have you been all my life
