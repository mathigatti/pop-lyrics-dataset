Well you call me your baby 
when you're holding my hand, 
But the way that you hurt me 
I just don't understand. 
Well you say that you need me 
like an ocean needs sand. 
But the way you deceive me 
I just don't understand. 
Well you know that I love you
more than anyone can. 
But a one sided love 
I just don't understand. 
Well you know that I love you
more than anyone can. 
But a one sided love 
I just don't understand. 
Well you call me your baby 
when you're holding my hand, 
Oh how you can hurt me 
I just can't understand.
