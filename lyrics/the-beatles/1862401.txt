I will spend my whole life through
Loving you, just loving you
Winter, summer, springtime too
Loving you, loving you


Makes no difference where I go or what I may do
You know that I'll always be loving you, just you

And if I'm seen with someone new
Don't be blue, don't you be blue
I'll be faithful, I'll be true
Always true, true to you

There is only one for me and you know who
You know that I'll always be loving you
