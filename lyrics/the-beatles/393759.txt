I don't want to see you again

I hear that love is planned
How can I understand when someone says to me
I don't want to see you again?


Why do I cry at night?
Something wrong could be right,
I hear you say to me
I don't want to see you again!

As you turned your back on me,
You hid the light of day.
I didn't have to play at being broken hearted.

I know that later on after love's been and gone,
I'll still hear someone say
I dont' want to see you again!

As you turned your back on me,
You hid the light of day.
I didn't have to play at being broken hearted.

I hear that love is planned.
How can I understand when someone says to me
I don't want to see you again?

I don't want to see you again.
I don't want to see you again.
I don't want to see you again.
