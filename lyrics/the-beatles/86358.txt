oh, yeah, oh, yeah
oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Imagine, I'm in love with you
It's easy because I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh, yeah, oh, yeah


I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you, I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue
So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Well, there's gonna be a time
Well I'm gonna change your mind
So you might as well resign yourself to me, oh, yeah

Imagine, I'm in love with you
It's easy because I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before
It's not like be to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
oh, yeah, oh, yeah
oh, yeah
