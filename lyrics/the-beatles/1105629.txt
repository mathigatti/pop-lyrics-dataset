I'm thnking about the times you drove in my car
I'm thinking that I might have drove you too far
And I'm thinking of the love that you laid on my table.


I told you not to wander 'round in the dark
I told you 'bout the swans that they live in the park
Then I told you 'bout our kid' now he's married to Mabel.

Yes I told you that the life goes up and down
Notice how the wheel goes around
And you'd better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down,
Yes, before they bring the curtain down.

Talking about a girl that looks quite like you
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue
She cried away her life since she fell out cradle.
