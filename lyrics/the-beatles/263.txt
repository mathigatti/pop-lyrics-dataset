Well that'll be the day
when you say goodbye.
Yeah that'll be the day
when you make me cry.
You say you're gonna leave,
you know it's a lie
'cos that'll be the day
when I die.
Well you gave me all your loving
and all your turtle doving,
all your hugs and kisses
and your money too.
You say you love me baby,
still you tell me maybe
that somebody, well I'll be through.
Well that'll be the day
when you say goodbye.
That'll be the day
when you make me cry.
You say you're gonna leave,
you know it's a lie
'cos that'll be the day
when I die.
Yes that'll be the day
when you say goodbye.
Yes that'll be the day
when you make me cry.
You say you're gonna leave,
you know it's a lie
'cos that'll be the day
when I die.
Well when Cupid shot his dart,
he shot it at your heart.
So if we'll ever part,
and I'll leave you.
You say and hold me,
and you tell me boldly
that some day, well I'll be through.
Well that'll be the day
when you say goodbye.
Yes that'll be the day
when you make me cry.
You say you're gonna leave,
you know it's a lie
'cos that'll be the day
when I die.
Yeah that'll be the day.
Ohoh that'll be the day.
Ohoh that'll be the day.
Ohoh that'll be the day.
