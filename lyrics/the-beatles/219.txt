You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cried for you


And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cried, it's true, oh

You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no
Not a second time

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cried for you, yeah

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cried, it's true, oh

You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time
not a second time
Not a second time
no, no, no, no, no
no, no no
