Don't ever try, to tame a wild cat
You'd just be wastin' your time
Just leave like you found me
Don't put no cage around me, oh-no, not me
You want a lamb, but I'm a wild cat
If you just keep that in mind
I'll let you hug and pet me
And then you gotta let me go free
Let me Be
You're a crazy, little kitten
But you just don't understand
Oh don't you chain me
Or try to train me
And you'll have me eatin' outta your hand
So don't forget that I'm a wild cat


And we'll just get along fine
The wild cat's what they name me
No kitten's gonna tame me, oh-no, not me
(Move over tiger)
You're a crazy, a-little kitten
But you just don't understand
Oh don't you chain me
Or try to train me
And you'll have me eatin' outta your hand
So don't forget that I'm a wild cat
And we'll just get along fine
The wild cat's what they name me
No kitten's gonna tame me, oh-no, not me.
Oh-no, not me, oh-no, not me, oh-no
