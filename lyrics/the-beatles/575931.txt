Brian: The next few minutes are in the lap of the gods and hands of the
Beatles.  In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and they...
Paul:  Yes.
Brian: Now they...
John:  Hey, listen.
Paul:  It's all changed now.
John:  It's all changed now.
Brian: Well this is what I'm wondering:
Paul:  We're not doing that. No actors.
John:  All now...
Brian: In those days the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor.  Did you find that?
John:  No, no, no.  These are the good bits in the film, that's certainly the best.
Brian: Yes.
John:  Rubish.
Brian: Was it really?
John:  Even worse.
Brian: Who was worse?
John:  Oh, Paul.
Brian: I see.
Paul:  I think John was rather worse.
John:  No, It was you.
Paul:  Oh, RIngo was very good.
Brian: He was?
Paul:  He's a good lad, yes.
Brian: They say he's a new Charlie Chaplan.
John:  He was born that.
Brian: Do you think this is right?
Paul:  He's a Charlie Chaplan?
John:  Oh yeah, but he's an old one. OK Ring.
Brian: You're beginning to look like it.
Ringo: Alright John!
Brian: Now then.
Ringo: Can you hear me?
Paul:  Can you hear him?
Brian: Not really, I hope not...
Ringo: Hello.
Brian: I hope not.
John:  We brought the flowers, Ring.
Brian: Not allowed to talk.
John:  We brought you the flowers.
Ringo: Oh, good.
John:  And the grapes.
Brian: Yeah.
Ringo: Oh, I like grapes.
John:  He likes grapes.
Brian: Time out, time out.
Paul:  He needs a pause.
John:  Well, then we are then.
Brian: Well, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then.
Paul:  Who?
John:  Who?
Paul:  Who?
Brian: Os Beatles.
John:  Los Beatles?
Paul:  Oh.
Brian: Rediculous, Os Beatles.
John:  [yells something in a foreign language???
Brian: I don't suppose you know the title of you film in Portuguese?
Paul:  No.
John:  No, "Crinsk Dee Night"?
Brian: Could be. Let's hear the number, shall we?
John:  Right!
