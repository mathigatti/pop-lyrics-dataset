Attract me
'til it hurts to concentrate
Distract me
Stops me doing work I hate


And just to show him how it feels
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on a chair
From the side he pulls my hair

(Amy Amy Amy)
Although I've been here before
(Amy Amy Amy)
He's just too hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
(Amy Amy Amy)
Where's my moral parallel?

It takes me
Half an hour to write a verse
He makes me
Imagine it from bad to worse

My weakness for the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
Way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track

(Amy Amy Amy)
Although I've been here before
(Amy Amy Amy)
He's just too hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
(Amy Amy Amy)
So where's my moral parallel?

His own style
Right down to his diesel jeans
Immobile
I can't think by any means

Underwear peeks out the top
I'll let you know when you should stop
From the picture my mum drew
I know I'd look good on you

(Amy Amy Amy)
Although I've been here before
(Amy Amy Amy)
You're just too hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
(Amy amy amy)
So where's my moral parallel?

Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused

But when I clock black hair, blue eyes
A teardrop I fantasise

(Amy Amy Amy)
Although I've been here before
(Amy Amy Amy)
He's just too hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
(Amy Amy Amy)
So where's my moral parallel?

(Amy Amy Amy)
Although I've been here before
(Amy Amy Amy)
He's just too hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
(Amy Amy Amy)
So where's my moral parallel?
