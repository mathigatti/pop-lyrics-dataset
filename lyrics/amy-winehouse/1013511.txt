I can't wait to get away from you
And surprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends right?


You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you're home at night
But we're best friends right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends, right?

I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

So I had love for you, and I was full
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, so you get the dro
Cause we are best friends right, right, right, right?
Because we are best friends right?
Because we are best friends right?
