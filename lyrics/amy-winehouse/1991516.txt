Simple sweet guitar
Humble by the bass
It's when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can't help a dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance


Halftime
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Halftime
Time to think it through
Consider the change

Rythm floods my heart
The melody feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole

You said that you're a lucky star
'Cause the music is a gift
And stronger than all else
Provides me with a bliff

Halftime
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Halftime
Time to think it through
Consider the change

My lyrics' revealing
Some natural vibe
It's a kind of playback feeling
Oh just that it right (oh just that ain't it right)

And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache

Halftime
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Halftime
Time to think it through
Consider the change
