(Chorus)
Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me


I don't want to bother you but I'm in distress
There's danger of me loosing all of my happiness
Cause I love a man who doesn't know I exist
Ah and this you can fix so...

(Chorus)
Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now if your arrow makes her love strong for me
I swear I'm gonna love him until eternity
I know that tween the both of us his heart we can steal
Cupid help me if you will so...

(Chorus)
Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Hey cupid, cupid I'm calling
Don't you hear me I'm calling you
