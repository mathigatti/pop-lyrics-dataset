Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say why did you do it with him today?
And sniff me out like I was tangueray
Why you actin' like youre more trouble than toney starks'n
You need to just walk away like kelly clarkson
I know. We were free to sleep around town
But I figured you said that cuz how I get down


Now of course, you were out there messin' around
I would've told you
Once you ghost you never go back
Try gee'n me like I dont know how to mack
I'm a don and
Top of the line I stay fly and
Stop tryin'
To keep coverin' the lies and
Using my credit cards to buy diamonds
We need to straighten this out
Get to the bottom of it all

Lets go before we start the war
Begin with two reasons why we need to talk
And stop poppin up in my cribs all over new york and
Death stalkin'
You such trouble and no good
Them fightin' words in my block and we in the hood
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was troubled
You know that I'm no good

You had to be a nasty girl and try to play me
Play me, play me, play me...
Nasty girl, nasty girl, nasty girl
Yeah, yo, yo
A-yo I knew you was trouble when I first layed eyes on you
Temperature so hot the heat just rise with you
Lemmee ride with you, talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it'll never be the same again cause of old boy
But oh boy,
Together we make so much joy
In the sands'n oh what a web we weave

But you played me so I had to roll up my sleeves
And hunt you down holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry and trying to bring that old thing back
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame
How you cant get me off the brain
He that lame
You love how I bring the pain

Got them rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name, uh
Thats right I'm high post
Get the champagne love, word up we gonna toast
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was troubled
You know that I'm no good

You had to be a nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl,girl
You can't leave the kid
You can't leave the kid
Don't worry I'm gonna be around forever
Nasty girl
Don't forget it imma be around forever
Don't forget it imma be around forever
Sweet reunion, jamaica and spain
Were like how we were again
I'm in the tub youre on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet

Yo, get to bath and bodyworks pumpin the spice cream
Together like cheech and chong we make nice dreams
These fight scenes
I take the good with the bad
Cause you give the best brains that ive ever had
Anything worth having is hard to keep
I love you like my coffee so hot and so sweet
So lets stick it out so we never regret it
I could forgive the past but I never forget it

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
Yeah ya know that I'm no good

I could forgive the past but I never forget it
Nasty girl, nasty girl
Try to play me
Nasty girl
You had to be a nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl
Try to play me, try to play me
Nasty girl
I could forgive the past but I never forget it
