Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me


Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me

For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go

So...
Make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me
