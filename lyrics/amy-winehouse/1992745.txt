Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes each man she passes goes Aaah!


When she walks it's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes each man she passes goes Aaah!

Oh, how I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
I would give my heart gladly

But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me

Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes I go...

The girl, the girl, the girl
From Ipanema, from Ipanema

I want her so badly
How can I tell her I love her
I would give my heart gladly

But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me

Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes I smile but she doesn't see
She ain't looking at me
