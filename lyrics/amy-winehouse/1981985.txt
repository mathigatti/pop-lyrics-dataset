I never wanted you to be my man
I just need your company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah, oh


It's not a movie, this is not a script to proofread
I'll spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies
Tryna punctuate the funds I make amounts I take
Put in your face oh, my mistake
You're not a floozy? Then excuse me
Before I talk, my style introduced me
Get your name and phone number like 1-2-3
Y'all know the story, y'all know the commentary
I kick the narrative, this is legendary
The good Samaritan, good thespian
Like a polygamist, with a twist
Will I marry again? Maybe, I guess
I hold a lady's interest, I just met
The love scholar, she the teacher's pet
Every other eve we'd meet and make each other sweat
I feel triumph with no strings
Just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Huntin' for the answers, why did God take away the homie?
I can't stand it
I'm a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy
Why? 'Cause I'm deemed a heartbreaker
Like smoke, girls linger 'round a player
Yeah-yuh

I never wanted you to be my man
I just need your company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah, oh

Yo, this recession is a test
It's affecting my complexion
Misdirecting my affection
My concerns of bill collections
The facts is the taxes, they after me
Chapter three, my property
My handlers, they dealt with me improperly
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like I'm IEG
This fly sweet bourgeoisie
Tall freak, she wouldn't protest with me at Wall Street
She says, no you're so deep
I said, no let's go thru it
Historically so ruthless feds came for Joe Lewis
She said, my man you needs to laugh sometime
Classifies me as a bore, I told her have some wine
You colder than penguin pussy at her her dismay
She's thinkin' that's just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy
See a penguin, he drags his ass on the ground all day
And there's a drag
And it's a bust and you're in tune with just lust
I'm thru with you after I crush, so is that humorous enough?
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura, Funky Buddah, Whiskey Mist
On Mayfair
I hope I meet some Monie Loves so she can show me love
NYC to UK I might stay there
Everybody in the club tonight say, "Yeah"
You know how me and Amy are, straight players

Ohh, ohh, ooooohh, ohh

I never wanted you to be my man
I just need your company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah, oh
