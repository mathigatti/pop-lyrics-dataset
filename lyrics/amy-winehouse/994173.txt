Everyday I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school


(Mister magic)
Taken a token
(Mister magic)
Of my love
(Mister magic)
I see you through the smoke

Without you I'm misery
Blue as a migraine
All the songs sound better when your next to me
Yeah, 'cause you come naturally

(Mister magic)
Taken a token
(Mister magic)
Of my love
(Mister magic)
I see you through the smoke

Laying on my bed
I reach out for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through

(Mister magic)
Taken a token
(Mister magic)
Of my love
(Mister magic)
I see you through the smoke

Mister magic
Mister magic
Mister magic
Waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear
