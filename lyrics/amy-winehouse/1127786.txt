I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco, but everyone was in jeans


But you were a rich girl, and only having fun
Your low cut dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pull off your nice clothes, just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom for a fate unknown

But you were a rich girl, hardly having fun
Your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
And now little rich girl, my words are in this song
Hey, little rich girl my love for you is gone
And now little rich girl, I know where you went wrong

At your dad's office party all the movies were blue
Caused him so much heart ache, because the screen star was you
You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pull off your nice clothes, but you were living on dreams

You were a rich girl, and only having fun
But your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
