My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh
For you, dear, only
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you
Body and soul


I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you
Body and soul

I can't believe it
ItÂ´s hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance

Are you pretending?
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more change to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you
Body and soul

Are you pretending?
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more change to prove, dear

Life's dreary for me
Day's seem to be long as years
I've looked for the sun
But can see none
Through my tears
Your heart must be like a stone
To leave me like this alone
When you could make my life worth living
By taking what I'm set on giving, sweet heart

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I cry
For you, dear, only
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you
Body and soul
