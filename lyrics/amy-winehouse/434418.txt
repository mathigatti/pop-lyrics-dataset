You should be stronger than me
You've been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always wanna talk it through - I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do - Stroke my hair
Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy


You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
You always wanna talk it through - I'm okay
I always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do ? Are you gay?
Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

He said the respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learn?
I said you don't know what love is, get a grip
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script?
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime
I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
