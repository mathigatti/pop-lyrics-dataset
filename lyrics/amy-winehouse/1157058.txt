You're wonderin' now, what to do
Now you know this is the end
You're wonderin' how, you will pay
For the way you misbehave


First time I swallowed
Now you're on your own
I won't return
Forever you will wait

You're wonderin' now, what to do
Now you know this is the end

First time I swallowed
Now you're on your own
I won't return
Forever you will wait

You're wonderin' now, what to do
Now you know this is the end
You're wonderin' how, you will pay
For the way you misbehave

You're wonderin' now, what to do
Now you know this is the end
