It's all gone within two days,
Follow my father
His extravagant ways
So, if I got it out I'll spend it all.
Heading in parkway, til I hit the wall.
I cross my fingers at the cash machine,
As I check my balance I kiss the screen,
I love it when it says I got the main's
To go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans.


Never last long
Had to fight what's wrong,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz n' blues.
Never last long,
Had to fight what's wrong,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz n' blues.

Standing to the bar today,
Waiting impatient to throw my cash away,
For that Russian JD and coke
Had the drinks all night, and now I am bold
But that's cool, cause I can buy more from you.
And I didn't forget about that 50 Compton,
Tell you what my fancy's coming through
I'll take you at shopping, can you wait til next June?

Never last long
Had to fight what's wrong,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz n' blues.
Never last long,
Had to fight what's wrong,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz n' blues.

Never last long
Had to fight what's wrong,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz n' blues.
Never last long,
Had to fight what's wrong,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz n' blues.
Never last long,
Had to fight what's wrong,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz n' blues.
