I can see you ahead of me
But I'm not always forward thinkin'
I tell you what you want to hear
It depends on what I've been drinkin'


Cuz everything I do or say
Makes it hard for you to stay
We both know what it is

Nowadays we talk to much
Like you're forgetting all the good shit
You decide what's wrong wit me
I always used to let you say

But now I like to think out loud
Your runnin' with some different crowd
We both know what it is

I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I can't even cry, cry

Mr ultra-sensitive
I'll never let myself forget you
Messed each other up you know
So I'm sorry if I upset you

Tomorrow is another day
So I'll call you 'cuz that's ok
We both know what it is

I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And you're attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired
I can't even cry, I can't even cry

Relationship dosen't remain
We resonate on different flames
I could cut you down again
If you was like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend, but my friend

I don't know you anyomore,
supposed to be the man, that I live my life by, I live my life.
You're attitudes become a bore,
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry.

I don't know you anyomore,
supposed to be the man, that I live my life by.
You're attitudes become a bore,
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry.
