Simple sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance


Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
'Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with uplift

Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
Somekind of laidback feeling
Oh, just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache

Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
