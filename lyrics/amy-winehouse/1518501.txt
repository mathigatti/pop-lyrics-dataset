Running down my batteries
Laying me out to rest
Knowing when that in five hours
I wake up into stress
And I'm digging myself into a hole
And these days I just work
On when one song had so much soul


And lately I've forgotten who I am
Need to let my energy just drain away
And now my mind is working overtime
It's been a long day
Such a long day, ay, ay

And while all my contemporary (all my friends say)
Are sitting in college now (sitting in a desk)
My education is dragging, dragging (yeah yeah)
My guitar through London town
And the thing that wakes me when I could sleep instead
Is the thought that tonight
I could fall back into bed

And lately, I've forgotten who I am
Need to let my energy just drain away
And now my mind is working overtime
It's been a long day
It's been a long day

Recently my head
It ain't recharged as such
And sleep can only cure, yeah
A restless mind so much

Lately I've forgotten who I am
Neep to let my energy just drain away
And now my mind is working overtime
It's been a long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long day
So long, so long, so long
