It's my party and i'll cry if i want to
Cry if i want to
Cry if i want to
You would cry too if it's happened to you


Nobody knows where my johnny has gone
But judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine

It's my party and i'll cry if i want to
Cry if i want to
Cry if i want to
You would cry too if it's happened to you

Play all my records keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'till johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile

It's my party and i'll cry if i want to
Cry if i want to
Cry if i want to
You would cry too if it's happened to you

Judy and johnny just walked through that door
Like a queen with her king
Oh what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring

It's my party and i'll cry if i want to
Cry if i want to
Cry if i want to
You would cry too if it's happened to you
