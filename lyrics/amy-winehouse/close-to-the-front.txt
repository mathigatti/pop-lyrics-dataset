Only paid attention in your lessons
I sat close at the front so I could see
Your enthusiastic demonstrations
Teaching to a class of only me
And I couldn't speak directly to you
Without stuttering or turning red
So looking back I don't know how I handled it, yeah
Futile frustration in my head


I can't help but analyze your actions
Neglecting mine
Before I know I've fallen hard
And now I tread water in time

Hated it when I saw them together
I sat around waiting for shit to end
Unconsciously I tried to Sabotage it
To get revenge on my best friend
Because I was in love with him before her
I had just cause to grieve
So not long after she broke up with him
I got my closure on New Yearâ€™s Eve

I can't help but analyze your actions
Neglecting mine
Before I know I've fallen hard
And now I tread water in time

I can't help but analyze your actions
Neglecting mine
Before I know I've fallen hard
And now I tread water in time

I love all the bickering and insults
And when I shout at you and you smile
Making coffee while my mind spills over
How I catch your art once in a while
Shouldn't I have grown a little wiser?
Why haven't I learned my lesson yet?
And although I have made my love progresses
I tend to learn as much as I forget

I can't help but analyze your actions
Neglecting mine
Before I know I've fallen hard
And now I tread water in time

I can't help but analyze your actions
Neglecting mine
Before I know I've fallen hard
And now I tread water in time

I can't help but analyze your actions
Neglecting mine
Before I know I've fallen hard
And now I tread water in time
