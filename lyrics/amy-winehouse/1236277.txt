She sits home and dreams
That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned
Now she won't be happy
'Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
But she will be waiting years for her wedding


For me it aint real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse, oh
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

He won't change her life
He just chasing tail
And wasting her time
She calls herself his wife
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
It's not a good fit
So next time that they row
She throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit

'Cuz for me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse, oh
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

So take the gold you find
And for your own sake
Hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band

For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse, oh
For me it aint real
Yes, it's fools gold
