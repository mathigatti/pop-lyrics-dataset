Can't believe you played me out like that (ah)

No, you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (all them girls)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (to yourself)
Can't believe you played yourself (out) like this

Rulers one thing, but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones)

I might let you make it up to me (make it up)
Who's playing Saturday?

What kind of fuckery are you?

But I could swear that we were through (we were through)
I still wonder 'bout the things you do
