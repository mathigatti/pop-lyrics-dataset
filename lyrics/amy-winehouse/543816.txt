You're just a little boy underneath that hat
You need your nerve to hide your ego 
Don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no


I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

My girl says I'm too sensitive to ride with you
But I'm not listening to her, mm hm
Yes I'm perceptive so when I've dance with you 
You'll whisk your head back the way it were
As you were

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

Oh, I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to what you say you're all about, yeah

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and them
I gotta know you now and then

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
