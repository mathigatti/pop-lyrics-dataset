All I can ever be to you
Is a darkness that we know
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right
When we were at our high
Waiting for you in the hotel at night


I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away I have no capacity

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I don't understand
Why do I stress the men
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could have never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal

Even if I stopped wanting you
A perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own

Whoa, he walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry
