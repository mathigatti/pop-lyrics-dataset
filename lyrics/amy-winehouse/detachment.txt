I did it, it's finished
It's over and done
Now I'm gonna sit back
Don't wait for the fun
Like a finger to the strings
You'd wail if I said these things


Have to lay awake guilty once you sleep
Or would you take me in your arms and weep?
I'm culpable for your scornful ways
And I can still taste better days
Now maybe it is for the best
But I've lost interest

I did, it's finished, it's over and done
Now I'm gonna back, don't wait for the fun
Oh, it changed you
