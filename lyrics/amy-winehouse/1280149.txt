Make a name for myself in different ways
All the while you will see my songs of praise
How can I concentrate when all the while my head
Throw me scenarios so I tease my self esteem


Though I can talk it through really I finally talk
My frustration is released but nothing let em' know
And added to that I'm sick of having to seek some peace
Because I need emotion with my physical release

Can't help but bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing
I'm wasting my breath
Can't help but bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath

They everywhere I go and I always stare
I justify attraction by your hands
Your lips, your hair
And so although I always look I know that I can't touch
And because I can only take a full time man so much

And now I reached a point
Where I don't care anymore
It's a necessity just like it was before
Many says I ignore the way my body aches
'Cause I'm the shit I earn I can't look for my sins
Oh, oh, no

Can't help but bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing
I'm wasting my breath
Can't help but bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath

Can't help
(I can't help but bring it up, now)
But my
Can't help
(I can't help, oh)
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath

Can't help but bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing
I'm wasting my breath
Can't help but bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath

Can't help
But my
Can't help
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath
