I bet you wonderin'
How I knew
'Bout your plans
To make me blue
With some other girl
You knew before
Between two of us girls
You know I love you more


It took me by surprise
I must say
When I found you yesterday

Don't you know that
I heard it
Through the grapevine
Not much longer
Would you be mine
Yeah
Heard it through
The grapevine
I'm just about
To lose my mind
Honey, honey

I know a man
Ain't supposed to cry
But these tears
I can't hold inside
Losin' you
Would end my life
You see
Cause you mean
That much to me
You could have
Told me yourself
That you loved
Somebody else

Instead
I heard it
Through the grapevine
Not much longer
Would you be mine
Oh
I heard it
Through the grapevine
And I'm just
About to lose my mind
Honey, honey

People say believe
Half of what you see
And none
Of what your hear
But I can't help
But be confused, yeah
Please
Please tell me dear
Do you plan
To let me go
For the other girl
You loved before?
