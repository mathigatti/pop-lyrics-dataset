Got back together with my man last night
But I think I was dreaming
He didn't feel quite right
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself I sighed
And reminded of his lips


I'm confused and quizical
Funny dontcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how

Do me good I'll tell you anything you want to hear
(Do me good do me good do me good do me good)
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
(Do me good do me good do me good do me good)

It's like he was designed with me in mind
He's so good from behind
He's beautifully defined
I miss him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing
Or feel his shifting weight
