When you walk in the bar
And you dressed like a star
Rockin' your F me pumps


And the men notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to

Cuz you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that's you whole claim to fame

Never miss a night
Cuz your dream in life
Is to be a footballers wife

You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire

You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller

You're more than a fan
Lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-nights-stands

He could be your whole life
If you got past one night
But that part never goes right

In the morning you're vexed
He's onto the next
And you didn't even get no taste

Don't be too upset
If they call you a skank
Cuz like the news everyday you get pressed

You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire

Or them big balers
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller

You can't sit down right
Cuz you jeans are too tight
And your lucky its ladies night

With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers

So you did Miami
Cuz you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane

You did too much E
Met somebody
And spent the night getting cane

Without girls like you
There'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone

Without girls like you
There's no nightlife
All those man just go home to their wives

Don't be mad at me
Cuz your brushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work

You should have known from the job
That you always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps
