Please wait for me; for I shall return;
My love for you will forever burn
Though we must part;
There's no reason to cry
Just say so long;
Because lovers never say goodbye


I love you;
My darling more than life itself
I wouldn't try to hurt you;
For I'd only be hurting my self

Just kiss me dear;
And hold me tight;
For you know this is not our last night
Though we must part;
There's no reason to cry
Just say so long;
Because lovers never say goodbye
