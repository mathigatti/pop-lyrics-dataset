Images present themselves to me
Seeds are ripe for reapin'
I can tell you sleepin'
You're everything you ever wanted to be
And nothing here is changing
No messy rearranging
Cause every set of ficus stays the same
Sinatra is always singing
And you do all the clinging
And someone else accepts my place
Whatever my imagination throws
So rugged, growing rose
When my eyes do close
When my eyes do close
When they close


Turn and face my cieling
Deep in all the feeling
Inhibitions turn to dust and fly away
Stop my eyelids flickering
With your petty bickering
But this I must say,
What I got to say
I hear my girl Dinah's playin'
And tree branches start swayin'
Run over and sit around by the roof
And I see the lips are growing
Little buds are showing
Reach out a hand
Invite him to the ............
Whatever my imagination throws
So rugged, growing rose
When my eyes do close
When my eyes do close
When they close

It's fragrant beautifully
Colorful and monochrome
Amy Winehouse alone
Far away from ringing phone at home
I turn to stone, turn to stone
And all the thoughts are static
Yeah, my singing is automatic
And I wish that I could sell it
Cause I can sense no danger
I am the lone ranger
Through the desert in a yellow caddy
With a black haired blue eyed stranger
What does that ............... drying
I've been fear for flying
I overtake Montgomery in
Never been more daring
Kitten heels I'm wearing
Reality a blow that

When I drop it lyrically
Words evolve generically
And I don't ever need to collapse in tears
And I could curse your timing
Thunderously miming
And I feel young beyond my years

Whatever my imagination throws
So rugged, growing rose
When my eyes do close
When my eyes do close
When they close
