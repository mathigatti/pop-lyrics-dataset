Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things of what you're doing
In my head I paint a picture


Since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Oh, won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house out up for sale?
Did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
Hope you find the right man
Who'll fix it for you

Are you shopping anywhere?
Change the color of your hair
And are you busy?
Did you have to pay that fine
That you were dodging all the time?
Are you still dizzy?

Since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Oh, won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Valerie

Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things of what you're doing
In my head I paint a picture

Since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Oh, won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
