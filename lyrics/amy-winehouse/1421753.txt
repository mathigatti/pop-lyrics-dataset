I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't hear me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep.


Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his snowy beard so white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

Oh, my Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
Oh, my Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
