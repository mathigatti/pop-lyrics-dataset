The evening breeze caress the trees
Tenderly
The trembling tress embrace the breeze
Tenderly
Then you and i came wandering by
And lost in sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist
Tenderly
I can't forget when two hearts met
Breathlessly
Your arms opened wide
And closed me in inside
You took my lips you took my love
So tenderly
Then you and i came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist
Tenderly
I can't forget when two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips you took my love
So tenderly
