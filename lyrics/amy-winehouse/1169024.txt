Her name is Cherry
We've just met
But already she knows me
Better than you
She understands me
After eighteen years
And you still don't see me
Like you ought to do


Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down
You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely
Cherry's there
And she plays along
While I sing out my blues
I could be crying
And you don't care
You won't call me back
You're stubborn as mule
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar
