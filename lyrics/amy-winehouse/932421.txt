He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on but no one's home
She is so vacant
Her soul is taken
He thinks 'what's she running from'


Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her
'Cuz what's inside her never dies

Even if she's content in his warmth
She is played with urgency
Searching kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be

Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her
'Cuz what's inside her never dies
