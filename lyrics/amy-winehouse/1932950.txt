Hello friend, how has it been?
Ain't it wonderful, you've got a friend?
Though we've changed in our endeavors
I found we still (have) some things in common
Ain't it strange but wonderful
That we, we're still friends


Through our hearts, we've never parted
But through our living
We're friends, through friendship all
And the way we are when we're together
Let us know that we still, love one another
Ain't that strange but wonderful
That we, we're still friends, yeah

Ain't that strange but wonderful
That we, we're still friends

Hello friend

Ain't it wonderful?
You, you got a friend yeah
