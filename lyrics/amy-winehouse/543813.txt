When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
They're much too big, but I don't care
I feel the weight your shoulders bear
Now I really empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you, you're so frustrated
But we all become what we once hated
Besides, nobody can be that wise


I can't help you if you won't help yourself (help yourself, help yourself)
I can't help you if you don't help yourself (help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone else (You can get so much from me)
I can't help you if you won't help yourself (help yourself)

You've got a degree in philosophy
So you think you're cleverer than me ('cause you're so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen (drama queen)
Cos it's where you're at not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
To hold your head above the sea (keep you high and dry)
And carry you, even though you're bigger
'Cos don't you know you crush my tiny figure
And anyway, we're still so young (yeah, i'm so young)
And this isn't yesterday

I can't help you if you won't help yourself (help yourself, help yourself)
I can't help you if you don't help yourself (help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone else (You can get so much from me)
I can't help you if you won't help yourself (help yourself)

You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years old most of the time
And I'm, I'm just a child and you're full grown
And it was like nothing that I've ever known
You are like nothing that I ever knew
