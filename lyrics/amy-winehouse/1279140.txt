(Swing back and forth
A beautiful thing
Taking you away
My head is spinning)


My girl tried to stop me
But I had a taste of you
Unfamiliar surroundings
Left me wanting something new
Physical ain't even my type
But you're one of a kind
So subconsciously on purpose
I left my coat behind

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah yeah
It's nice to meet you, too

I hate my alcoholic logic
As I write this on the train
Victoria's Secret in my bag
And my thighs ache again
Last night tips into my mind
Through the puddle in my head
I always get what I want
I think I even said

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah yeah
It's nice to meet you, too

Although I enjoyed it
I should have tied up my loose ends
But I left my jacket with you
And you know my friends
So maybe you will get my number
Or ask them when I'm ached down
But I may have forgotten you
By the next time I'm in town

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah yeah
It's nice to meet you, too
