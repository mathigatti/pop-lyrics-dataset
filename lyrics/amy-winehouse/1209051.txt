Rewind.
Let's journey back to the times, when that lady she was mine, how we just sit and stare and sigh.
And she, she whispered soft to me "baby you're my valentine", cupid can run but he can't hide
At night, I ask myself why I treat her so badly, so badly she flyin'
Went south for the winter, the note shattered in her
She's sitting pretty with some other guy.


Chorus:
Now I find you saw the best in me when I was blind
Now I see, you are the best for me
the best for me

Friday and I think I'm fine
Singing for my valentine, honey child of mine
You say I'm waiting for fall, while I'm just unconditional, saying you can have it all
so how am I here again?
Always out with other men, now you're just my friend.
Let me look out for ya then
cause I'm not waiting for you to say you will.

Chorus

You saw the best for me, and I never realized
But I was blind, I was blind, I was blind, I was blind
You saw the best for me, but I never realized
Cause I was blind

Chorus x 3
