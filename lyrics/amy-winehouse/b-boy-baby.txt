It was winter time
You know what they say
Did you think about us
Did you miss your baby
I'm gonna catch the train
Cos' I'm heading your way
You're my number 1
That's all a new born son
Won't you be my king
(Won't you be my king)

Cos' I know you care
Did a dance for you
And when I'm done
I'm gonna do it again
And when it's over
I'm gonna pull you closer
Keep your Nike's on
You know how we do
There's nothing he won't try
We like two stars in th sky

You are my rainy day's Sunshine
It's plain to see
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please

B boy
Be my baby
(Won't you be my baby)

My one and only baby
(Be my baby now)
B boy
Be my baby
(Be my baby now)
My one and only baby
(oo oo oo ooh)

There are two in the air
If you feel like me
Someone who cares for so freaky
In demand by all the ladies
It's not for sale
It's being home delivered to me
So hang up all your trying cards please
(He's my baby)

Lovesick cos' thats what I get
I hear his voice then things get wet
Know's what I want
And then he'll fetch
He's my boo
And I'm his little pet, his little pet
You never know what he'll do next
He's my baby

My rainy day's bright Sunshine
Live in fantasy
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please

B boy
Be my baby
(Won't you be my baby)
My one and only baby
(Be my baby now)
B boy
Be my baby
(Be my baby now)
My one and only baby
(oo oo oo ooh)

B boy
Be my baby
(Won't you be my baby)
My one and only baby
(Be my baby now)
B boy
Be my baby
(Be my baby now)
My one and only baby
(oo oo oo ooh)
