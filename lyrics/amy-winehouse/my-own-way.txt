I've never been in love before
Such a foolish thing to be
Seems to me the price is high
So I'll keep my own company


And I'll do what I want
When I feel
Watch them fall so easily
Temporary insanity
Some say that true love is blind
Me I like to clarify
While I

I just take
My own time
And I
I'll go my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna talk talk
When I wanna

Seems to be illogical
Love that's unconditional
Give your heart to someone else
But save a little for your self
That's why I'm

I'm taking my own time
And I
I'll go my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna

Don't get me wrong
It's kinda cynical
But it scares though
So I'm careful with my heart
It's the only one I got
I cannot
Commit to that shit

Ill talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna
I'll go my own way

And I'll walk when I wanna and tell u
When I wanna
My own way my own way
When I wanna when I wanna
