I don't catch your drift and I don't catch your plan
Need to get my thoughts down but it's getting late
Need to get up now, get my feet on the ground
But the show is so unprepared now
My place so messed up, I tried on some shoes
Should think clear and focus, but I've things to do
Glancing at my CD rack, eyes linger on frank
And I must put that check in the bank


Try to put me in a room
Distractionless
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio, I will finally burn
All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Always got something to do, someone to be seeing
Somewhere to be dancing I'm a wake human being
It's an opportunity, shout 'till you go blue
Unless I wanna do it
Your words go through
Need to buy some cigarettes, can't put it off any longer
Worked appeal depression
I feel it growing stronger
Maybe when I'm all grown up, I will get it through
But right now I got stuff to do

Try to put me in a room
Distractionless
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio, I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Put me in a room
Distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio, I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Gotta get this song down before I leave tonight
But my hair, just does it's own thing
And I gotta look alright
And I gotta write a chorus, but words allude me now
I have to get this down before I leave somehow
And anyway I be thinkin' to meet you at the station
Guilty 'cause I should be home
Damn Procrastination
So when they ask me later, I won't tell them how it's going
But now my head is empty, and the work load keeps on growing

Try to put me in a room
Distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio, I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Put me in a room
Distraction less
Spare me from worse
In the studio, I would finally burn
Tempted to work

Distraction less
Spare me from worse
I would finally burn
Tempted to work...
