They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said: No, no, no
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back
You'll know-know-know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
But I won't go, go, go


I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said: No, no, no
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back
You'll know-know-know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
But I won't go, go, go

The man said: Why do you think you're here?
I said: I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said: I just think you're depressed
Kiss me here, baby, and go rest

They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said: No, no, no
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back
You'll know, know, know

I don't ever want to drink again
I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not going to spend ten weeks
And have everyone think I'm on the mend

It's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said: No, no, no
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back
You'll know-know-know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
But I won't go, go, go
