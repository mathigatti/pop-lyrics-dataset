Your neighbours were screaming
I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers
Hoping he would be there
And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the showe when I got there
And I don't wanted to stay
But I got nothing to say


You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say: Man that was ugly

The moschino bra you bought me last christmas
(Put it in the box, put it in the box)
Frank's in there and I don't care
(Put it in the box, put it in the box)
Just take it
Take the box

Take the box

I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me, you know me
Feel so damn angry don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen,
I said goodbye to your bedroom and it smelled to you

Mr. False pretense, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye?
I think I love you

The moschino bra you bought me last christmas
(Put it in the box, put it in the box)
Frank's in there and I don't care
(Put it in the box, put it in the box)
Now take it
Take the box
Just take it, take it
Take the box
And now just take the box
Take the box
