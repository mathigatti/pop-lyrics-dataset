Brother, 
It's so much that I could never say to your face 
But by now 
You should know the world and all its ways 
So find your place! 


How do I find words that do not condescend 
When she bore you before me 
Cause she doesn't need a child she needs a friend 
A son, not a sob story 

 
Now you must of never heard of what she did for you 
And your priority it must be heard 
Now you must of never heard of what she did for you 
Cause we'll never be the way we were 

She can't always be there just to hold your down 
Our mother 
When you are at a age now 
well life turns around, my brother 

Realize that you don't have to answer to no man 
Responsibility comes down to you 
But how can I expect you to understand 
When you live life like its so unthrough 



Now you must of never heard of what she did for you 
And your priority, it must be heard 
Now you must of never heard of what she did for you 
Cause we'll never be the way we were 

The way we were 
We'll never be 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
At your priority, It must be heard
