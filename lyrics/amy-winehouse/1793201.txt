If I ever leave you baby, you can say I told you so
And if I ever hurt you, I hurt myself as well


Now, is that any way for a man to carry on?
Do you think I want my loved one gone?
Said I love you
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

Well, I wasn't making too much money
You know where my paycheck went
I brought it all home to you baby
I never spent one red cent

Now, is that any way for a man to carry on?
Do you think I want my loved one gone?
Said I love you
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

Now I'm not trying to be
Towards any kind of man
I'm just trying to be somebody
That you can love, trust and understand
I know, I know, I know I can be
A part of you no one else could see
But I got to hear you say
I'll got to hear you say
It's alright

I'm only flesh and blood
But I can be anything that you demand
I can be king of everything
Or just a tiny grain of sand

Now, is that anyway for a man to carry on?
Do you think I want my loved one gone?
Said I love you
More than you'll ever know

Oh
I no want nobody else
I no need nobody else
I love ya
More than you'll ever know
