21 years in captivity
Shoes too small to fit his feet
His body abused, but his mind is still free
Are you so blind that you cannot see


Free Nelson Mandela
Free, free, free, free
Free Nelson Mandela

21 years in captivity
Shoes too small to fit his feet
His body abused, but his mind is still free
Are you so blind that you cannot see

Free Nelson Mandela, free
Free Nelson Mandela, free

Visited the causes at the AMC
Only one man in a large army
Are you so blind that you cannot see
Are you so deaf that you cannot hear him

Free Nelson Mandela, free
Free Nelson Mandela, free

21 tears in captivity
Are you so blind...

21 tears in captivity
Are you so blind that you cannot see
Are you so deaf that you cannot hear him
Are you so dumb that you cannot speak

Free Nelson Mandela, free
Free Nelson Mandela, free
Free Nelson Mandela, free
Free Nelson Mandela, free
