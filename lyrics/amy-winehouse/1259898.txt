There's a saying old 
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told 
"Seek and ye shall find"
So i'm going to seek 
A certain lad 
I've had in mind


Looking everywhere 
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair 
I cannot forget
Only man i ever think 
Of with regret

I'd like 
To add his inital 
To my monogram
Tell me 
Where is the shepherd 
For this lost lamb?

There's a somebody 
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns 
Out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb 
Who's lost in the wood
I know i could 
Always be good
To one 
Who'll watch over me

Although he may 
Not be the man some 
Girls think 
Of as handsome
To my heart 
He carries the key

Won't you tell him please 
To put on some speed
Follow my lead 
Oh, how i need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please 
To put on some speed
Follow my lead 
Oh, how i need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me
