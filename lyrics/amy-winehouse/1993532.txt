I would die before I divorce you
I'd take a thousand thumps for my love
Cause you kissed a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove


'Cause anyone who's seen us
Through our victories and dumb defeats
Know they I'll take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats

Between the cheats
Between the cheats
Between the cheats

My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And he still makes this housewife blush
So I'm holding my hand in his
I'm sitting on the royal flush

Women drink him in, swimming in his green eyes
Then go home and cash the chips you've got
And here maybe two, oh, two bottles of..
The jack of heart is my jackpot

Between the cheats
Between the cheats
Between the cheats

'Cause we only have to lock eyes
And I know it's my heart beat
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn between the cheats

Between the cheats
