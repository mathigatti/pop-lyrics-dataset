You always hurt the ones you love
That's why I had to twist the blade
Goodbyes ain't my forte
Hat tipped, you go your way
You'll never meet a girl like me
I'll never meet a boy like you


No-one who knew what we went through
Would designate us someone new

As black as Fat Kams' market trade
White as the rap sheet of a dove
This is the way you switched the blade
You always hurt the ones you love
That’s why I had to read and sign
With all your rhythm, no pride
We didn’t stand the test of time
You'll never find another me
I'll never find another you
Whatever I trusted wasn’t true
Then you rub salt in the womb

As black as Fat Kams' market trade
White as the rap sheet of a dove
This is the way you switched the blade
You always hurt the ones you love
Nobody else knew how we play the game
However you felt I wanna feel the same
It’s too late now to suck out the poison
You always knew how to knock me down
And pick me up again
Our time was not our friend

You always hurt the ones you love
That’s why I had to twist the blade
Goodbyes ain't my forte
Hat tipped, you go your way
You always hurt the ones you love
You always hurt the ones you love
You always hurt the ones you love
