I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you


I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darlin', won't you please see through me?
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front, well baby I was hiding
But now I'm so much better with my words coming together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there, hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
'Cause you the boy next door and a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember, remember, remember, remember, remember
When we were together
And I was singing this song for you

We were alone and
I was singing this song for you
Singing this song for you
Singing this song

We were alone
And I was singing this song
For you
