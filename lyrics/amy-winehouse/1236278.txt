It begins to tell
'round midnight
'round midnight
I do pretty wait
'till after sundown
It's up to my feel of shed
But it really is bad, now it's night yet.


Memories always start
'round midnight
'round midnight
I haven't got the heart
To stand those memories
So when, when my heart is still with you
It's so midnight knows it too.

For 'round midnight
When it comes aroundâ€¦

So let our heart take wing
'round midnight
'round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returnin'
To our love is safe and sound
And though midnight comes around
There's a feel of shed and it really is bad
'round midnight
'round midnigh
