Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do, but
Run, run, run
Let's run
Let's run


House upon the hill
Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
C'mon baby run with me
Let's run

Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside

Dead president's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
Come on along, not goin' very far
To the East to meet the Czar

Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

Whoa!

Some outlaws lived by the side of a lake
The minister's  daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl, we're almost home

Ya, c'mon!

We should see the gates by mornin'
We should be inside the evenin'

Sun, sun, sun
Burn, burn, burn
Soon, soon, soon
Moon, moon, moon
I will get you
Soon!
Soon!
Soon!

I am the Lizard King
I can do anything
