Five to one, baby, one and five
No one here gets out alive
Now, you get yours and I get mine
Gonna make it baby if we try


We all get old and the young get stronger
May take a week and it may take longer
They got the guns but, we got the numbers
Gonna win you we're taking over

Your ballroom days are over, baby
Night is growing near
Shadows of the evening
Crawl across the years

You walk across the floor with a flower in your hair
Tryin' to tell me no one understands
Trade in your hours for a handful of dimes
Gonna make it baby in our prime
Come together one more time
Come together one more time

Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
