You know it just done slipped my mind
Just done slipped my mind
Just so hard to find
You know it just done slipped my mind
I left my body somewhere down the line
It's just so easy to lose track of time
You know it just done slipped my mind
You know it just done slipped my mind


It wouldn't matter but it's time to meditate
You know it just done slipped my mind
My memories undefined
They must haved spiked my wine
Because it just done slipped my mind

My mind and body are still out of tune
I hope they run into each other real soon
You know it just done slipped my mind
You know it just done slipped my mind
I wouldn't mind but it's cold here on the moon
You know it just done slipped my mind

You know it just done slipped my mind
My memories undefined
You know it just done slipped my mind
They must have spiked my wine
My mind and body are still out of tune
I hope they run into each other real soon
You know it just done slipped my mind
You know it just done slipped my mind

I wouldn't mind but it's cold here on the moon
You know it just done slipped my mind
You know it just done slipped my mind
