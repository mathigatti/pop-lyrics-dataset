Poor Otis dead and gone
Left me here to sing his song
Pretty little girl with the red dress on
Poor Otis dead and gone


Back down, turn around slowly
Try it again, remembering when
It was easy, try it again
Much to easy, remembering when

All right, look at my shoes
Not quite the walkin' blues
Don't fight, too much to lose
Can't fight the runnin' blues

Well, I've got the runnin' blues
Runnin' away, back to L.A.
Got to find the dock on the bay
Maybe find it back in L.A.

Runnin' scared
Runnin' blue
Goin' so fast
What'll I do

Well, I've got the runnin' blues
Runnin' away, back to L.A.
Got to find the dock on the bay
Maybe find it back in L.A.

All right, look at my shoes
Not quite the walkin' blues
Don't fight, too much to lose
Can't fight the runnin' blues

All right, look at my shoes
Not quite the walkin' blues
Don't fight, too much to lose
Can't fight the runnin' blues
