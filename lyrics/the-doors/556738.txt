Someday soon
Someday soon
Familiar freaks will fill your living room
Rugs lash out there lizard tongues
You're not getting young
You're not getting young


But your going to die
And your going to be needing all of your eyes

You'll be all alone
When the cannibals cry
All by your self
Inside infancy's lie

Someday soon
Someday soon
Television bleeding like a harvest moon
Flush the scissors down the hole
You're getting old
You're getting old

And I hate to remind you, but your going to die
And your going to be needing all of your lies

You'll be all alone
When the cannibals cry
All by yourself
Inside infancy's lie

Someday soon
Someday soon
Someday soon
Someday soon
