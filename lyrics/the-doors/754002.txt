Well, I heard a story you can judge it's worth
About the sun and the moon
This time they came down to earth


They passed in the heavens each day up above
Time after time and it soon became love

They could not touch, they could not kiss
They had no flesh, no earthly bliss

So they made a scheme, they made a plan
They would come down to earth as a woman and a man

She rode a lunar wave, he flew a solar beam
They took on human forms to live out a dream

The most beautiful people that I've ever seen
They were the Peking King and the New York Queen
I said the Peking King and the New York Queen.

As fate would have it in the toss of the dice
They went to opposite ends of this world of our lives
Opposite eyes, opposite minds
Such things matter in these troubled times.

Peking in the East and New York in the West
Each place thought that it was the best
But the sun and the moon on their earthly quest
Knew without a doubt that it was all the best

They said what does it matter how you read a book
It's all the same no matter how it looks.

Well the only thing important to the Peking King
Was bein' in the arms of his New York Queen

Thousand of miles, they were so far apart
How to get together? Oh, where to start?

On the California Zephyr and the Shanghai Express
He headed to Hong Kong, she headed out west.

No passports, no visas, no government quotas
No secret missile sites in South Dakota

No red tape, no red guard could stop the dream
Of the Peking King and the New York Queen
I said, the Peking King and the New York Queen

Well they found a little island in the Phillipines
It was a perfect little place to live out a dream
They say East is East, West is West
They say the twain won't meet, but don't you take that bet

'Cause you're invited to a wedding and to share the dream
Of the Peking King and the New York Queen
The Peking King and the New York Queen.

'Cause you're invited to a wedding and to share the dream
'Cause you're invited to a wedding and to share the dream
Of the Peking King and the New York Queen
The Peking King and the New York Queen.

You're invited to the wedding of the sun and the moon
