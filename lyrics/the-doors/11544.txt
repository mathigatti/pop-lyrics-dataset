The movie will begin in five moments

The mindless voice announced

All those unseated will await the next show

We filed slowly, languidly into the hall

The auditorium was vast and silent

As we seated and were darkened, the voice continued.

The program for this evening is not new

You've seen this entertainment through and through

You've seen your birth your life and death

you might recall all of the rest

Did you have a good world when you died?

Enough to base a movie on?

I'm getting out of here
Where are you going?
To the other side of morning
Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas


Her cunt gripped him like a warm, friendly hand.

It's alright, all your friends are here
When can I meet them?
After you've eaten
I'm not hungry
Uh, we meant beaten

Silver stream, silvery scream

Oooooh, impossible concentration
