Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Penetrate the evening that the
City sleeps to hide


Let's swim out tonight, love
It's our time to try
Park besides the ocean
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Surrender to the waking world
That laps against our side

Nothing left open
And no time to decide
We'll stop into a river
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
You'll reach your hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide

Easy, I love you
As I watch you glide
We're falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive
Moonlight drive

Come on baby, gonna take a little ride
Down, down by the ocean side
Get real close, get real tight
Baby, gonna drown tonigh
Goin' down, down, down
