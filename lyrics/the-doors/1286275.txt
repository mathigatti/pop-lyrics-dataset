I went down to the crossroads,
Fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroads,
Fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy,
"Save me if you please"


I went down to the crossroads,
Tried to flag a ride
I went down to the crossroads,
Tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me,
Everybody passed me by

I'm going down to Rosedale,
Take my rider by my side
I'm going down to Rosedale,
Take my rider by my side
You can still barrelhouse,
Baby, on the riverside

You can run, you can run,
Tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
You can run, you can run,
Tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
And I'm standing at the crossroads,
Believe I'm sinking down
