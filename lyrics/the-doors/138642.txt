Grandma love a sailor
Who sailed the frozen sea
Grandpa was a whaler
And he took me on his knee


He said, "Son, I'm going crazy
From livin' on the land
Got to find my shipmates
And walk on foreign sands"

This old man was graceful
With silver in his smile
He smoked a briar pipe and
He walked four country miles

Singing songs of shady sisters
And old time liberty
Songs of love and songs of death
And songs to set men free

Yeah!

I've got three ships and sixteen men
A course for ports unread
I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow
Till half of us are dead

Land ho!

Well, if I get my hands on a dollar bill
Gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill
If I get my hands on a number five
Gonna skin that litlle girl alive

If I get my hand on a number two
Come back home and marry you, marry you
Alright!

Ey, land Ho!
Ey, land Ho!

If I get back home and I feel all right
You know baby gonna love you tonight
Love you right, love you right

Ey, land Ho!

Ey, land Ho!

Ey, land Ho!
