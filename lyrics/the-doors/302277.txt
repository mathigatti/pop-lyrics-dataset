All right, listen now. At this time I would like to introduce a
friend of ours, 
a very talented guy named John Sebastian. Come on man. 
Man, that's what I call a New York joint, man!
You can pick your teeth with a New York joint! 
Well, I'm the little red rooster 
Too lazy to crow the day. 
Little red rooster 
Too lazy to crow the day. 
Keep everything in the barnyard 
Upset in every way. 


Dogs begin to bark 
The hounds begin to howl. 
Dogs begin to bark and 
The hounds begin to howl. 
Look out strange cat people 
The rooster's on the prowl. 

Yeah, dogs begin to bark 
The hounds begin to howl. 
Dogs begin to bark 
The hounds begin to howl. 
Look out strange cat people 
Yeah, the rooster's on the prowl. 

If you see my rooster 
Come on man, drive him home. 
See my rooster, babe 
Come on man, drive him home. 
Ain't been no peace in the barnyard 
Since my little red rooster been gone. 

Well, I'm the little red rooster, babe 
Too lazy to crow the day. 
Well, I'm the little red rooster, babe 
Too lazy to crow the day. 
Keep everything in the barnyard 
Upset in every way.
