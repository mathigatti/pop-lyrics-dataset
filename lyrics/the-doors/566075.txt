Oh, Carol!
Don't let him steal your heart away.
Yeah I'll love you litle darling
If it takes me all night and day.


Beat cool down,
Over cool down,
I hear that highway sound.

Oh Carol!
Never give your heart away.
Well I'm gonna love you little darling
If it takes me all night and day.

Beat cool down,
Over cool down,
I can hear that highway sound.
Oh yeah,
Oh right.
Well I love you little darling
If it takes me all night and day.

Oh, Carol!
Never give your heart away.
Oh, Carol!
Never give your heart away.
Love you darling
If it takes me all night and day.
