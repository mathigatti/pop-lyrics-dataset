Beautiful thing
All right, now look, look, we've...we've seen a lot of things
Happened in the city
And everything's turned around. Everything's beautiful
Nobody thought we'd be able to bring the Doors here, and we did


But we've got a couple of thi... Wait a second, man!
Look, we've just got a couple of little things that we've gotta

Now hold it, we've gotta tune up
Hey, Philadelphia!
Do you feel all right?
