Well I used to know someone fair
She had orange ribbons in her hair
She was such a trip
She was hardly there
But I loved her
Just the same


There was rain in our window
The FM set was ragged
But she could talk, yeah
We learned to speak
And one year
Has gone by

Such a long long road to seek it
All we did was break and freak it
We had all
That lovers ever had
We just blew it
And I'm not sad

Well I'm mad
And I'm bad

And two years
Have gone by
Now her world was bright orange
And the fire glowed
And her friend had a baby
And she lived with us
Yeah, we broke through the window
Yeah, we knocked on the door
Her phone would not answer
Yeah, but she's still home

Now her father has passed over
And her sister is a star
And her mother smokes diamonds
And she sleeps out in the car
Yeah, but she remembers Chicago
The musicians and guitars
And grass by the lake
And people who laughed
And made her poor heart ache

Now we live down in the valley
We work out on the farm
We climb up to the mountains
And everything's fine
And I'm still here
And you're still there
And we're still around
