Gonna tell your daddy that we need some dough
We're gonna get married down in Mexico
We got love, don't need no more
But all we got to live on is a hardwood floor
You know all we got to live on is a hardwood floor
We got love don't need no more
All we got to live on is a hardwood floor
All we got to live on is a hardwood floor
All we got to live on
All we got to live on
All we got to live on is a hardwood floor
Like I said before


Well I had a lot of money about a year ago
Spent all my money on a rock 'n' roll show
I got a lot to tell, aint got nothing to show
All we got to live on is a hardwood floor
On this hardwood floor
On this hardwood floor

Well I went to see your daddy but he sure got sore
He said you oughta be out there fighting the war
I asked him for some money, he said what for
I told him all we got to live on is a hardwood floor
You know all we got to live on is a hardwood floor

We got love don't need no more
All we got to live on is a hardwood floor
On this hardwood floor
On this hardwood floor
On this hardwood floor
All we got to live on is this hardwood floor
All we got to live on is this hardwood floor
