I wanna tell you about texas radio and the big beat
Comes out of the virginia swamps
Cool and slow with plenty of precision
With a back beat narrow and hard to master


Some call it heavenly in it s brilliance
Others, mean and ruthful of the western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the pharaoh died

The negroes in the forest brightly feathered
They are saying, "forget the night
Live with us in forests of azure
Out here on the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we is stoned - immaculate."

Listen to this, and I'll tell you  bout the heartache
I'll tell you  bout the heartache and the lose of god
I'll tell you  bout the hopeless night
The meager food for souls forgot
I'll tell you  bout the maiden with raw iron soul

I'll tell you this
No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn

I'll tell you  bout texas radio and the big beat
Soft drivin, slow and mad, like some new language

Now, listen to this, and I'll tell you  bout the texas
I'll tell you  bout the texas radio
I'll tell you  bout the hopeless night
Wandering the western dream
Tell you  bout the maiden with raw iron soul
