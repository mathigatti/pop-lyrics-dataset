Wake up! 
You can't remember where it was. 
Had this dream stopped? 
The snake was pale gold 
Glazed &amp; shrunken. 
We were afraid to touch it. 
The sheets were hot dead prisons. 


And she was beside me. 
Old, she's numb. 
Her dark, red hair, 
The white soft skin. 

Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom, 
Look! 
She's coming in here 
I can't live thru each slow century of her moving. 
I let my cheek slide down 
The cool smooth tile 
Feel the good cold stinging blood 
The smooth hissing snakes of rain...
