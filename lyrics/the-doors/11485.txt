I found my own true love was
On a blue Sunday
She looked at me and told me
I was the only
One in the world
Now I have found my girl


My girl awaits for me in tender time
My girl is mine
She is the world
She is my girl

La, la, la, la

My girl awaits for me in tender time
My girl is mine
She is the world
She is my girl
