You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run, tried to hide


Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side, yeah

We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
But can you still recall the time we cried?

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

Yeah
C'mon, yeah

Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She gets high
She gets high
She gets high
She gets high

I found an island in your arms
A country in your eyes
Arms that chained us, eyes that lied

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, wow, oh, yeah

Made the scene, week a week
Day a day, hour a hour
The gate is straight, deep and wide

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

Break on through
Break on through
Break on through
Break on through
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
