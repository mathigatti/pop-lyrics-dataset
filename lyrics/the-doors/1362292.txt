Come on, turn the lights out, man
Turn it way down
Hey Mister Lightman
You gotta turn those lights way down, man!
Hey, I'm not kidding, you gotta turn the the lights out
Come on!
What do we care...?


This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
My only friend, the end

Of our elaborate plans, the end
Of everything that stands, the end
No safety or surprise, the end
I'll never look into your eyes again

Can you picture what will be
So limitless and free
Desperately in need of some stranger's hand
In a desparate land
Come on, baby!

And we were in this house and there was a sound 
like silverware being dropped on linoleum, 
and then somebody ran into the room and they said:
"Have you seen the accident outside?"
And everybody said:
"Hey man, have you see the accident outside?"

Have you seen the accident outside
Seven people took a ride
Six bachelors and their bride
Seven people took a ride
Seven people died

Don't let me die in an automobile
I wanna lie in an open field
Want the snakes to suck my skin
Want the worms to be my friends
Want the birds to eat my eyes
As here I lie
The clouds fly by

Ode to a grasshopper...
I think I'll open a little shop,
A little place where they sell things
And I think I'll call it "Grasshopper"...

I have a big green grasshopper out there
Have you seen my grasshopper, mama?
Looking real good...

Oh, I blew it, it's a moth
That's alright, he ain't got long to go, so we'll forgive him

Ensenada
The dog crucifix
The dead seal
Ghosts of the dead car sun
Stop the car
I'm getting out, I can't take it
Hey, look out, there's somebody coming
And there's nothing you can do about it...

The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he...he walked on down the hallway, baby
Came to a door
He looked inside

Father?
Yes, son?
I wanna kill you
Mother...I want to...
Fuck you, mama, all night long
Beware, mama
Gonna love you, baby, all night

Come on, baby, take a chance with us
Come on, baby, take a chance with us
Come on, baby, take a chance with us
Meet me at the back of the blue bus
Meet me at the back of the blue bus,
Blue rock,
Blue bus,
Blue rock
Blue bus

Kill! Kill!

This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
Mmy only friend, the end

Hurts to set you free
But you'll never follow me
The end of laughter and soft lies
The end of nights we tried to die
This is the end
