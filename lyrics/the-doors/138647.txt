She was a princess
Queen of the highway
Sign on the road said
"Take us to Madre"


No one could save her
Save the blind tiger
He was a monster
Black, dressed in leather

She was a princess
Queen of the highway

Now they are wedded
She is a good girl
Naked as children
Out in the meadow

Naked as children
Wild as can be
Soon to have offspring
Start it all over

Start it all over

American boy, American girl
Most beautiful people in the world
Son of frontier Indian Swirl
Dancing through the midnight whirlpool, formless
I hope it can continue just a little while longer
