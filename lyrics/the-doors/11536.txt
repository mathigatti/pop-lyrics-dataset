At first flash of Eden, we race down to the sea
Standing there on freedom's shore


Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

Can you feel it, now that spring has come?
That it's time to live In the scattered sun

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting

Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to hear my song

Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to tell me what went wrong

This is the strangest life I've ever known

Can't you feel it, now that spring has come?
That it's time to live In the scattered sun

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
