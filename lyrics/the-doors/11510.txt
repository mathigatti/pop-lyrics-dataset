I was doing time in the universal mind,
I was feeling fine.
I was turning keys, I was setting people free,
I was doing all right.


Then you came along
with a suitcase and a song,
turn my head around.
Now I'm so alone
just looking for a home
in every place i see.
I'm the freedom man, I'm the freedom man.
I'm the freedom man, that's how lucky I am.
