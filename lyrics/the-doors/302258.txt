Give me a witness, darling. 
I need a witness, babe. 
Wow, hey! 
I got the poontang blues, yeah. 
I got the poontang blues. Yeah.
Top of my head down 
To the bottom of my cowboy shoes. 
All right! 


Build me a woman, 
Make her ten feet tall. 
You got to build me a woman, 
Make her ten feet tall. 
Don't make her worthless, 
Don't make her, wow, small. 
Right, oh, come on!

You got! 
Build me a woman, 
Make her ten feet tall. 
Build me a woman, 
Make her ten feet tall. 
Don't make her worthless, 
Don't make her small. 
Build me someone I can ball 
All night long.
