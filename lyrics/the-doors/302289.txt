Want you to rock me
Rock me all night long
Rock me baby
Rock me all night long


Want you to rock me
'Till I sing my song

See the sun goin' down
Moon begin to rise
See the sun goin' down
Moon begin to rise
Want you to rock me
'Till I'm satisfied
Let's rock awhile

Sun goin' down
Little moon begin to rise
Sun goin' down
Little moon begin to rise
Want you to rock me, little darlin'
'Till I'm satisfied
Let's rock awhile

See me comin', mama
Bring out that old rockin' chair
See me comin', mama
Bring out your rocking chair
No one's watching us
And god knows, no one cares
One more time

Want you to rock me, baby
Rock me all night long
Rock me baby
Rock me all night long
You gotta rock me, little woman
Rock me all night long
