Yeah, we're going to the roadhouse
We're gonna have a real
Good time
Back at the roadhouse, some bungalows
Yeah, back at the roadhouse they got some bungalows
And that's for the people
Who like to go down slow

Let it roll, baby, roll

Give up your vows, said you got give up your vows
You got to save our city

Right now, baby, right now

I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer
I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer
The future's uncertain, end is always near

Let it roll, baby, roll
All night long
Let it roll, roll, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
