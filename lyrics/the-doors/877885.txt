Prime time suicide; they are creatures with no rights
They are so cold; some heads are gonna roll
Wipe it off and spit it out


I know where you go
Devil or angel or heaven or steel
Got more to say

Evil is forever
In good times and despair
Evil is forever
And tomorrows luck is drifting in the air

It's the same song and nothing going wrong
In the carnage of our lives
Stand up and fight the commercialized
And you will be the last to find

Stray hound, fool around
Saints and sinners, beggars and thieves
No more to say

Evil is forever
In good times and despair
Evil is forever
And tomorrows luck is drifting in the air

So evil

[Solo: Nordlund / Haglund]

Prime time suicide; they are creatures with no rights
They are so cold; some heads are gonna roll
Wipe it off and spit it out

I know where you go
Devil or angel or heaven or steel
Got more to say

Evil is forever
In good times and despair
Evil is forever
But no one really cares
Evil is forever
It is here to ruin your day
Evil is forever
And you want to go, but one day you shall pay
So evil

Evil is forever
Evil is forever
Evil is forever
And it makes me wanna cry
Evil is forever
Soon I'm gonna die
Evil is forever
Can you hear me now?
Evil is forever
Gonna die
Evil is forever
