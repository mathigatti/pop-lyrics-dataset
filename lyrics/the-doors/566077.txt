Well I'm a king bee.
Want you to be my queen.
Well I'm a king bee, baby
Want you to be my queen.
Together we can make honey
The world have never seen.


I'm young and able
To buzz all night long.
I'm young and able
To buzz all night long.
We're gonna make a little honey,
Hear my song.
"John Sebastian, play the guitar"

Well I'm a king bee.
Buzzin' all night long,
Well I'm a king bee baby,
Buzzin' all night long,
Well you hear me buzzin' baby.
Some stingin' goin' on.
All right, yeah.

Well I'm a king bee baby,
"Take it, Jim"
Ahhh..., yeah
