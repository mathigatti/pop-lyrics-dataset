Well I'll tell you a story of whiskey and mystics and men
da da da
And about the believers and how the whole thing began
da da da
First there were women and children obeying the moon
da da da
then daylight brought wisdom and fever and sickness too soon
da da da
you can try to remind me instead of the other you can
da da da
you can help to insure that we all insecure are command
da da da
If you don't give a listen I won't try to tell your new hand
da da da
this is it can't you see that we all have our in's in the band
da da da
da da da
da da da
And if all of the teachers and preachers of wealth werea-reigned
we could see quite a future for me in the literal sands
and if all of the people could claim to expect such regrets
da da da
well we'd have no forgiveness, forgetfullness, painful remorse.
da da da
so I tell you I tell you I tell you we must sail away
da da da
we must try to find a new answer instead of a way.
