Man, the first woman know she smells so nice
And she looks so good i gotta zip up once or twice
Well I've been down
Up and up
Up and down
In 99, but I love my woman
Like the sun goes up


She's the sweetest little woman
When she wakes up
Come on, now right

Now you walk around
And you thinking that you're so though
I see you walking around
You think that you're so though
Well you got some thing momma,
But it's not enough

I'm going home
I'm going home and lay down
I'm going home, baby
I'm going home and lay down

Gonna switch on the television
I'm gonna drown, yeah

Well it's a long time coming
Long time coming, long time coming
Long time coming, long time coming
But when you find her baby
You know you found something good

When you find somebody now,
Don't leave it no good
