You know that it would be untrue 
You know that I would be a liar 
If I was to say to you 
Girl, we couldn't get much higher 
Come on baby, light my fire 
Come on baby, light my fire 
Try to set the night on fire 


Time to hesitate is through 
No time to wallow in the mire 
Try now we can only lose 
And our love become a funeral pyre 

Come on baby, light my fire 
Come on baby, light my fire 
Try to set the night on fire

Aouh, come on! 
Come on, babe! 

Yeah! Come on!
Come on!

Woaouh! Yeah! 

It was the greatest night of my life. 
Although I still had not found a wife
I had my friends 
Right there beside me. 
We were close together. 
We tripped the wall, we scaled the graveyard 
Ancient shapes were all around us. 
The wet dew felt fresh beside the fog. 
Two made love in an ancient spot 
One chased a rabbit into the dark 
A girl got drunk and balled the dead 
And I gave empty sermons to my head. 
Cemetary, cool and quiet 
Hate to leave your sacred lay 
Dread the milky coming of the day. 

Ah, ah, ah, ah! 
Ah, ah, ah, ah! 
Ah, ah, ah, ah! 
Ah, ah, ah, ah! 
Ah, ah, ah, ah! 
Ah, ah, ah, ah! 
Ah, ah, ah, ah! 
Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah 
Aah, aah, aah, aaah! 

Time to hesitate is through 
No time to wallow in the mire 
Try now we can only lose 
And our love become a funeral pyre 

Come on baby, light my fire 
Come on baby, light my fire 
Try to set the night on fire 

Know that it would be untrue 
You know that I would be a liar 
If I was to say to you 
Girl, we couldn't get much higher 

Come on baby, light my fire 
Come on baby, light my fire 
Try to set the night on fire 
Try to set the night on fire 
Try to set the night on fire 
Try to set the night on fire! 

All right, all right! 
All right!
