Baby, I can´t figure it out 
Your kisses taste like honey 
Sweet lies don´t gimme no rise 
Oh, oh what you´re trying to do? 


Livin´ on your cheatin´ 
and the pain grows inside me 
It´s enough to leave me crying in the rain 
Love you forever but you´re 
driving me insane 
and I´m hanging on 
Oh, oh, I´ll win, I´ll never give in 

Our love has got the power 
Too many lovers in one lifetime 
ain´t good for you 
You treat me like a vision in the night 
Someone there to stand behind you 
When your world ain´t working right 

I ain´t no vision, I am the man 
who loves you inside out 
backwards and forwards with 
my heart hanging out 
I love no other way 

What am I gonna do if we lose that fire? 
Wrap myself up and take me home again 
Too many heartaches in one 
lifetime ain´t good for me 
I figure it´s the love that keeps you warm 

Let this moment be forever 
we won´t ever feel the storm 
I ain´t no vision, I am the man 
who loves you inside out 
backwards and forwards with 
my heart hanging out 

I love no other way 
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire? 
Don´t try to tell me it´s all over 
I can´t hear a word I can´t hear a line 
No man could love you more 
And that´s what I´m cryin´ for 
You can´t change the way I feel inside 

You´re the reason for my laughter and my sorrow 
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow 
No man on earth can stand 
between my love and I 
And no matter how you hurt me 
I will love you till I die 

I ain´t no vision, I am the man 
who loves you inside out 
backwards and forwards with 
my heart hanging out 
I love no other way 
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
