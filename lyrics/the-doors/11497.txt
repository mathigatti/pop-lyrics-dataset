Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Now, touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?


Now, I'm gonna love you
'Til the heaven stops the rain
I'm gonna love you
'Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and I

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Now, touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?

I'm gonna love you
'Til the heaven stops the rain.
I'm gonna love you
'Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and I

I'm gonna love you
'Til the heaven stops the rain.
I'm gonna love you
'Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and I
