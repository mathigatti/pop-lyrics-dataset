In the eye of the sun before the world had begun
Takin' it easy, I was havin' some fun
Loafin' anda jokin' it was all energy
No such thing as you and or me
No time, you are mine
In the eye of the sun before the world had begun


It had been alot of work the last time around
Needed a rest, a chance to just lie down
Always on the go, no time to kill
Alot of runnin' to and fro hard working in the mill
So it blew up and I threw up
Into the eye of the sun before the world had begun

Well I hung around, don't know how many years
No more troubles, no more fears
Had alot of rest w/nothing to do
But I got kinda bored with nothin' to do
I wanted flesh and blood, skin and bones
Multidimensional, universal home
I was space and time up and down
Live and dead, blood all around
I knew there'd be trouble, but I could pull through
So I thought of the world and humans too.
