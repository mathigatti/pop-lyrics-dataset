Know darling, I have a past,
Today I smile and say minced words and when you expect to hear 'I love you "I say in the automatic ...


I'll tell you what I missed
I had a baby, I had friends
I loved every baby but they fought for a piece of me ...

But when I needed them dear,
They give me and stole my life from me
And now what I do is I hide, then you thought baby
I had a baby, and she was making me feel good "smooth love

But staff could not be together
She was in the hands but did not know it
Aah yes she gave the world with a simple smile
But I never let her see that it was important
I taught everything I know her and now she has well ...
Yes she stole my life and my friends and says he wants me back

But I found you baby, and a piece I became his
I am safe here with you
It was more my brilliance, I would be better for you

(chorus)
But you'll never see me in my best days
But you'll never see me in my best days
But you'll never see me in my best days

Why do I always I will hide all the pain in my eyes and you'll never know
