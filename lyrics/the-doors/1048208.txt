Please don't tell me what to do
'Cause even if I wanted to
I couldn't throw my life away
By listenening to what you say
I'm telling you, aint nothing you can do to change my way
Hey, hey, hey
Aint no way gonna make me think like you do


No matter if the sun or stars say I'm wrong
It's just a song of the lonely wandering musician
I'm telling you, aint nothing you can do to change my way
No, no, no, no, no
Aint no way gonna make me think like you do

It's just a song of a lonely wandering musician
I'm telling you, aint nothing you can do to change my way
Hey, hey, hey
Aint no way
Hey, hey, hey
Aint no way
Hey, hey, hey
Aint no way
