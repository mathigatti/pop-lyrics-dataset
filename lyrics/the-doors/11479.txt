She lives on Love Street
Lingers long on Love Street
She has a house and garden
I would like to see what happens


She has robes and she has monkies
Lazy diamond studded flunkies

She has wisdom and knows what to do
She has me and she has you

She has wisdom and knows what to do
She has me and she has you

I see you live on Love Street
There's this store where the creatures meet
I wonder what they do in there
Summer sunday and a year
I guess I like it fine, so far

She lives on Love Street
Lingers long on Love Street
She has a house and garden
I would like to see what happens
