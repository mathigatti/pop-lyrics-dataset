All hail the american night!

What was that?
I don't know
Sounds like guns...thunder.


(roadhouse blues)

...alright! alright! alright!
Hey, listen! listen! listen, man! listen, man!
I don't know how many you people believe in astrology...

Yeah, that's right...that's right, baby, i...i am a
Sagittarius
The most philosophical of all the signs
But anyway, i don't believe in it
I think it's a bunch of bullshit, myself
But i tell you this, man, i tell you this
I don't know what's gonna happen, man, but i wanna have
My kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames
Alright!
