All right

Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face


Natural child, terrible child
Not your mother's or your father's child
Your our child, screamin' wild

(An ancient lunatic reigns
in the trees of the night)

With hunger at her heels
And freedom in her eyes
She dances on her knees
Pirate prince at her side
Staring into the hollow idol's eye

Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face
Your cool face
Your cool face

You remember when we were in Africa?
