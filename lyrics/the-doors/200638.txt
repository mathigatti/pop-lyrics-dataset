A military station in the desert

Can we resolve the past
Lurking jaws, joints of time?
The base
To come of age in a dry place
Holes and caves


My friend drove and hour each day from the mountains
The bus gives you a hard-on with books in your lap
Someone shot the bird in the afternoon dance show
They gave out free records to the best couple
Spades dance best, from the hip
