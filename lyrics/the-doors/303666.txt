Yeeeah 
Yeeeah 
Yeeeah 
I walked 47 miles on barbed-wire, 
Cobra-snake for a necktie. 
Built a house by the roadside, 
Made of rattlesnake hide. 


Brand new chimney up on top, 
Made out of human skulls. 
Come on baby take a walk with me, 
Tell me who do you love? 

Who do you love, now? 
Who do you love, now? 
Who do you love, babe? 
I say: Who now, who do you love? 

Tombstone head and a graveyard mind, 
Just 22 and I don't mind dying. 
Rode around the town with a rattlesnake whip, 
Come on baby don't give me no lip. 

Who do you love, now? 
Who do you love? 
Who do you love, child? 
I said: Who, baby, who do you love? 

Night is dark, the sky was blue, 
Down the alley the ice wagon flew. 
Hit a bump, somebody screamed, 
Should'a heard just what I seen. 

Do you love me, babe? 
Do you love her, yeah 
Do you love me, babe? 
Do you love it, yeah
Yeeeeeah 

Well, who, baby, who do you love? 
What do you love, now? 

Love, love, love me babe. 
Love, love, love me darling. 

We're gonna have some fun tonight, right? 
All right, all right.
