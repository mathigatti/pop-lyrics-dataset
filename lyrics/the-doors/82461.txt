Miss Maggie M'Gill, she lived on a hill
Her daddy got drunk and left her the will
So she went down, down to Tangie Town


People down there
Really like to get it on

Now if you're sad and you're feeling blue
Go out and buy a crand new pair of shoes
And you go down, down to Tangie Town

The people down there
Really like to get it on
Get it on

Illegitimate son of a rock n' roll star
Illegitimate son of a rock n' roll star
Mom met dad in the back of a rock n' roll car

Well, I'm an old blues man
And I think that you understand
I've been singing the blues ever since the world began

Maggie, Maggie, Maggie M'Gill
Roll on, roll on, Maggie M'Gill
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie M'Gill
Roll on, roll on, Maggie M'Gill
