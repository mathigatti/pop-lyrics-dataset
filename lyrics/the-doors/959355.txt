Sweet bird of prey you've gone below
All soft and black it's time to grow
Don't be afraid to touch the light
Don't run from love in the starless night


Hang on to your life it's begun now
Hang on paradise here we come now
Life is like the wind, where does it begin?

Time come again, where's your day now?
Bring me your sunlight, it's the way now
Just spread your wings and taste the sky
It's time to laugh, it's time to fly
The mountain air is clear and bright
Your shadow world is endless night

Hang on to your life it's begun now
Hang on paradise here we come now

Hang on to your life it's begun now
Hang on paradise here we come now
Life is like the wind, where's it gonna end?
