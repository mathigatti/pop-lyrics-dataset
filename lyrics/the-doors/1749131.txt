Have you heard?
Have you heard?
Have you heard?
Have you heard the word?
(I'm talkin' about love)
(I'm talkin' about love)


The only thing I'm interested in
(Love)
(Love)
The only thing I'm interested in
(Love)
(Love)
Under waterfall
Under waterfall
The girls return from summer balls
Let's steal the eye that sees us all

And one morning, you awoke
(Our love's in jeopardy)
And the strange sun
(Our love's in jeopardy)

There's only one thing I wanna see
(Love)
(Love)
There's only one thing I wanna see
(Love)
(Love)
Under waterfall
Under waterfall
The girls return from summer balls
So let's steal the eye that sees us all

(We are not talking about no revolution)
(I'm not talking about no demonstration)
(I'm talking about having some fun)
(I'm talking about death too)
(I'm talking about love your lady till it hurts)
(I'm talking about grabbing your friend)
(I'm talking about love)
(I'm talking about some love)
(I'm talking about some love)
(I'm talking about love)
Under waterfall
Under waterfall

The girls return from summer balls
So let's steal the eye that sees us all
Under waterfall
(Love)
(Love)
Under waterfall
(Love)
(Love)
The girls return from summer balls
So let's steal the eye that sees us all
(Love)
(Love)
(Love)
(Love)
