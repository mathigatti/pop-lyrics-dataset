One, two, three, four billion souls are gonna rest
If all our friends don't try their best
To change the way this world is headed for
We can find our hapiness
It aint so hard to find
Just look a little further up the line
Just a little further up in time
Don't you see that we could be the first in history
Leavin' all that we don't need behind
We could clean it up and make it shine
