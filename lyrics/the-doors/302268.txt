It was the greatest night of my life. 
Although I still had not found a wife 
I had my friends 
Right there beside me. 
We were close together. 
We tripped the wall and we scaled the graveyard 
Ancient shapes were all around us. 
The wet dew felt fresh beside the fog. 
Two made love in an ancient spot 
One chased a rabbit into the dark 
A girl got drunk and balled the dead 
And I gave empty sermons to my head. 
Cemetary, cool and quiet 
Hate to leave your sacred lay 
Dread the milky coming of the day.
