We could be so good together
Ya, so good together
We could be so good together
Ya, we could, i know we could


Tell you lies
I tell you wicked lies
Tell you lies
Tell you wicked lies

Tell you 'bout the world that we'll invent
Wanton world without lament
Enterprise, expedition
Invitation and invention

Ya, so good together
Ah, so good together
We could be so good together
Ya, we could, know we could

Alright!

We could be so good together
Ya, so good together
We could be so good together
Ya, we could, know we could

Tell you lies
Tell you wicked lies
Tell you lies
Tell you wicked lies

The time you wait subtracts the joy
Beheads the angels you destroy
Angels fight, angels cry
Angels dance and angels die

Ya, so good together
Ah, but so good together
We could be so good together ya, we could, know we could
