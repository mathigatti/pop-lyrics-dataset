You need meat, go to the market
You need bread, try the bakery
You need loving, look here, baby
I got just what you need


I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
Somebody don't love me

You need money, go to the bank, dear
You need honey, look to the bee
You need loving, come on here, woman
Well, I got just what you need

Oh, play it now!

I want to love somebody
Yeah, love somebody
I got to love somebody
Somebody got to love me
