Thoughts in time and out of season
The hitchhiker
Stood by the side of the road
And leveled his thumb
In the calm calculus of reason


Hi? Iow you doin'? I just got back into town l.a.
I was out on the desert for awhile

"Riders on the storm"

Yeah, in the middle of it

"Riders on the storm"

Right

"Into this world we're born"

Hey, listen, man, I really got a problem

"Into this world we're thrown"

When I was out on the desert, ya know

"Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan"

I don't know how to tell you

"Riders on the storm"

But, ah, I killed somebody

"There's a killer on the road"

No...

"His brain is squirming like a toad"

It's no big deal, ya know
I don't think anybody will find out about it, but...

"Take a long holiday"

Just, ah

"Let your children play"
This guy gave me a ride, and ah...

"If you give this man a ride"

Started giving me a lot of trouble

"Sweet family will die"

And I just couldn't take it, ya know

"Killer on the road"

And I wasted him

Yeah
