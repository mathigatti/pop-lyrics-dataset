There will never be
Another one like you
There will never be
Another one who can
Do the things you do, Oh


Will you give another chance?
Will you try a little try?
Please, stop and you'll remember
We were together
Aanyway
All right!

Now, if you have a certain evening
You could lend to me
I'd give it all right back to you
Know how it has to be, with you
I know your moods
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind

Will you stop and think and wonder?
Just what you'll see
Out on the train-yard
Nursing penitentiary
It's gone
I cry out long

Go head, brother

Did you stop to consider
How it will feel
Cold grinding grizzly bear jaws
Hot on your heels

Do you often stop and whisper
It's Saturday's shore
The whole world's a savior
Who could ever ever ever ever, ever, ever
Ask for more?

Do you remember?
Will you stop?
Will you stop, the pain?

There will never be another one
Like you
There will never be
Another one who can
Do the things you do, Oh

Will you give another chance?
Will you try, a little try?
Please stop and you'll remember
We were together
Anyway
All right

How you must think and wonder
How I must feel
Out on the meadows
While you're on the field
I'm alone for you
And I cry

"He's sweatin', look at him
optical promise
you'll be dead and in hell before
I'm born
sure thing...bridesmaid
the only solution
Isn't it amazing?"
