I'll tell you this...

No eternal reward will forgive us now

For wasting the dawn.

Back in those days everything was simpler and more
confused


One summer night, going to the pier

I ran into two young girls

The blonde one was called Freedom

The dark one, Enterprise

We talked and they told me this story

Now listen to this...

I'll tell you about Texas radio and the big beat

Soft driven, slow and mad

Like some new language

Reaching your head with the cold, sudden fury of a divine
messenger

Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god

Wandering, wandering in hopless night

Out here in the perimeter there are no stars

Out here we is stoned

Immaculate.
