Well you asked how much I love you
Why do ships with sails love the wind?
And will I be thinking of you
Will I ever pass this way again
I'll be returning some day
Until then, please don't ask me my direction
Let my tracks be buried in the sea
'Cause to wander is my infection
'Till the four winds bring you back to me
Don't count your memories
Think of me as just a dream
Just like this melody, I sing
