Once I had a little game 
I like to crawl back in my brain 
I think you know the game I mean 
I mean the game called "go insane" 
Now you should try this little game 
Just close your eyes forget your name 
Forget the world, forget the people 
And we'll erect a different steeple 
This little game is fun to do 
Just close your eyes, no way to lose 
And I'm right there, I'm going too 
Release control, we're breaking through
