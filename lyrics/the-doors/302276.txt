Lions in the street and roaming 
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming 
A beast caged in the heart of a city 
The body of his mother 
Rotting in the summer ground. 
He fled the town.
He went down South and crossed the border 
Left the chaos and disorder 
Back there over his shoulder. 


One morning he awoke in a green hotel 
With a strange creature groaning beside him. 
Sweat oozed from its shiny skin. 

Is everybody in? 
The ceremony is about to begin.
