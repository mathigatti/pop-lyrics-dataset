Carry me caravan, take me away
Take me to Portugal, take me to Spain
Andalusia with fields full of grain
I have to see you again and again


Take me, spanish caravan
Yes, I know you can

Trade winds find galleons lost in the sea
I know where treasure is waiting for me
Silver and gold in the mountains of Spain
I have to see you again and again

Take me, spanish caravan
Yes, I know you can
