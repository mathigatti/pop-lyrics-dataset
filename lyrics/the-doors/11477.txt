Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm


Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out alone
Riders on the storm

There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirming like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play

If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road, yeah

Girl you gotta love your man

Take him by the hand
Make him understand
The world on you depends
Our life will never end
Gotta love your man, yeah

Riders on the storm

Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out alone
Riders on the storm

Riders on the storm
