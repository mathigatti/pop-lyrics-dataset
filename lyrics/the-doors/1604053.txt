Is everybody ready
Is everybody ready


Me and the devil gonna take you on a long and evil ride

Well were all in the cosmic movie you know that

That means the day you die you got to watch your whole life
Recurring eternally forever
So you better have some good incidents happening in there
And a fitting climax
And a fitting climax Ha ha ha ha ha

We had some good times
Ya those good good times
Were absolutely positively under the ground
Under the ground
As long as I got breath
The death of rock is the death of me
The death of rock is the death of me

Ha ha ha ha ha

Out here we is stoned immaculate
Stoned immaculate
Out here we is stoned immaculate
Stoned immaculate

Can you give me sanctuary
I must find a place to hide
A place for me to hide
Well were all in the cosmic movie know that
That means the day you die you got to watch your whole life
Recurring eternally forever
So you better have some good incidents happening there
A fitting climax

I tell you this, I don't know what's gonna happen man
But I'm wanna have my kicks before the whole shit house goes up in flames.
