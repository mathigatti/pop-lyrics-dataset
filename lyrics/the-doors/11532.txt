Tell all the people that you see
Follow me
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Set them free
Follow me down


You tell them they don't have to run
We're gonna pick up everyone
Come on, take me by the hand
Gonna bury all our troubles in the sand,
Oh, yeah

Can't you see the wonder at your feet
Your life's complete
Follow me down
Can't you see me growing, get your guns
The time has come
To follow me down

Follow me across the sea
Where milky babies seem to be
Molded, flowing revelry
With the one that set them free

Tell all the people that you see
It's just me
Follow me down

Tell all the people that you see
Follow me
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
We'll be free
Follow me down

Tell all the people that you see
It's just me
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Follow me
Follow me down

Follow me down you got to follow me down
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
We'll be free
Follow me down
