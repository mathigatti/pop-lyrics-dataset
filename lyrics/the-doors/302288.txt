Hi, you lady, alright, babe, gonna love ya

When I was just a little boy, 'bout the age of five
I went to sleep
I heard my mama and papa talking
She said
We got to stop that boy, he's gettin too far out


He's goin' wild, we gotta stop that child
And I lay there listening, feeling bad
You know, people, I was feeling bad
Mama didn't like the way I did my thing
The old lady, she didn't get with that thing
But my daddy was a sailor, get his head around
And he said
Boy you got to do it son, get yourself intact
You gotta love love love love love my baby tonight
Let me tell you baby 'bout the death of rock
I used to be a boy in my home block
Used to feel alone then I heard some news
Bunch o'cats got the rockin' news
You know I love my rock'n'roll people
You know we got some fun
We gonna rock tonight, yeah, c'mon
Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead
Must be something else instead
You got to lay right down and
Die, die, die, die, yeah
It's all over, baby
That's it
We gotta go
We had some good times
But it's gone
It's all over

I got a few things on my chest, I got to get 'em off
Now listen listen listen listen listen
Now I don't want to hear no talk about no revolution
And I swear to God I don't want to hear
No talk about no constitution
And in my frame of mind I am in no mood for
No talk about no... Cremation
The only thing I'm interested in
I wanna have a good time
I don't wanna hear no talk about no riots
No demonstrations, no cacitritions, no impablermations
There's only one thing I want to see
That's some dancin'
We're gonna have some fun
We're gonna have a good time
Let's roll

O boogie, all night long, yeah
Rocky little woman be my pal
Gonna be the fool, gotta deep-dap-doo
You gotta love, love, love ya baby little lotta-gita-do
Yeah, c'mon

Yeah, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute
Now listen here people
I'm talkin' about the death of rock and roll
And who killed it
I'm talkin' about the blues
I'm talkin' about the news
Have you heard, have you heard
Have you heard the word?
Rock is dead
Rock is dead
Now I didn't want to be the one to lay it on ya sweetheart
But I used to be a little fellow traveller
I used to think we had the whole thing sewed up, mama
Then I realised
Rock and roll is dying, baby
I wanna see some fun
I wanna see some hanging out
I wanna see my people
Non-political
Arithmetical
Transcendental

Are you ready to sing the blues, my baby?

Yeah, I like it real slow
I like it real bad
I like to get myself together
I love to hear you get undressed
Naked woman, out of doors
I don't care how loud you snore
Sun goin' down, way out on the sea
Here she comes, little girl, gonna set me free
Alright c'mon, now, one more time

Yeah
Train a'ride, sixteen coaches long
Train a'ride, sixteen coaches long

Gonna take her, gonna hug her, gonna, whoa
Gonna love, love, love, love a dingo, yeah
Big black train

Now when I got home
I heard my daddy say

You want a little piece?
Do you want a little peace?
Do you want a little soul?
Do you want a little soul?

I could not help myself, I could not help myself
I could not help
Help! Help
I'm dyin'! I'm dyin'! I'm dyin'
I'm die, die, digadigadoohdah whoa

It's over
It's over
Have mercy
Have mercy
Have mercy on your poor son

We had some good times
We had a few good times
But
Those good little times - you know where they are?
They're absolutely, positively under the ground
And
As long as I got breath, the death of rock
Is the death of me
And rock is dead
Well, we're dead, alright, yeah

Rock is dead
