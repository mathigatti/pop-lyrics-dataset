Strange days have found us
Strange days have tracked us down
They're going to destroy
Our casual joys
We shall go on playing or find a new town


Yeah!

Strange eyes fill strange rooms
Voices will signal their tired end
The hostess is grinning
Her guests sleep from sinning
Hear me talk of sin and you know this is it

Yeah!

Strange days have found us
And through their strange hours, we linger alone
Bodies confused
Memories misused
As we run from the day to a strange night of stone
