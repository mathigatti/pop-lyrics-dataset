Who scared you?
Why were you born, my babe?
In two-time's arms with all of your charms, my love.
Why were you born?
Just to play with me?
To freak out or to be beautiful, my dear?


Load your head,
blow it up, feeling good, baby
Load your head,
blow it up, feeling good, baby, ahh

Well my room is so cold,
you know you don't have to go, my babe
And if you warm it up right
I'm gonna love you tonight, my love
Well I'm glad that we came
I hope you're feeling the same

Who scared you and why were you born?
Please, stay

I see your rider
coming down the road
Got a virgin, carrying a heavy load
One sack of silver and one bag of gold
