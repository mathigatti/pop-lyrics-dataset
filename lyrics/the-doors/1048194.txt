Oh people, get up and dance
The new days comin', it's the end of a chance
No need to worry, no need to hide
Everybody is on the same side
Oh people, get up and dance


The future's ours if we just take a chance
No need to hurry, but no time to waste
The year 2000 is the time of hate
Oh people, get up and dance

Like walkin' along an electric beam
It's the old crystal palace dream
Oh people, get up and dance
The new days comin', it's the end of a chance
The future's ours if we just take a chance
No need to hurry, but no time to waste
So come on people, get up and dance

Yeah, get up and dance
C'mon, lets get up and dance
Golden days
Get up and dance
We'll have diamond nights
Get up and dance
We got sweet light shinin'
Get up and dance
Golden days
Get up and dance
We'll have diamond nights
C'mon people, get up and dance
C'mon, get up and dance
Let's dance
Get up and dance
