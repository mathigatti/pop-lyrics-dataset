The human race was dyin' out
No one left to scream and shout
People walkin' on the moon
Smog will get you pretty soon


Everyone was hangin' out
Hangin' up and hangin' down
Hangin' in and holding fast
Hope our little world will last

Yeah, along came Mr. Goodtrips
Lookin' for a new a ship
Come on, people better climb on board
Come on, baby, now we're goin' home

Ship of fools
Ship of fools

The human race was dyin' out
No one left to scream and shout
People walkin' on the moon
Smog will get you pretty soon

Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
