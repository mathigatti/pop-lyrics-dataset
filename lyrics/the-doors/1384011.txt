Get out of my life, woman 
You don't love me no more
Get out of my life, woman 
You don't love me no more
Get out of my life, woman 
You don't love me no more


Get out of my eyes teardrops 
I gotta see my way around
Get out of my eyes teardrops 
I gotta see my way around
Get out of my life heartache 
I got heartaches by the pound 
(These days)

Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on 
Yeah, walk on

Get off my ladder, woman 
I gotta climb up to the top
Get off my ladder, woman 
I gotta climb up to the top
Get off my ladder, woman 
You know that I can't stop

I can't stop 
I can't stop
I can't stop 
I can't stop

Get out of my life, woman 
I gotta be moving on
Get out of my life, woman 
I gotta be moving on
Get out of my life, woman 
It's so long

Bye, bye, bye, bye 
So long
Bye, bye, bye, bye 
So long 
Little darlin' goodbye
So long, so long

Twenty long years 
Little darlin' 
That I spent with you
Twenty long years 
That we shared a home
Twenty long years 
Little darlin' 
Now 
I'm black and blue
Twenty long years 
Now 
I'm back on my own

Bye, bye 
So long
Bye, bye 
So long
