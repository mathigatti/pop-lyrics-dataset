And I Know
It will be
An easey ride
All right
And I know
It Will be
Easy ride
Ok


The mask that you wore
My fingers would explore
Easy ride, yeah
Which your pride
Which your pride, yeah

Black polished stone
Black polished stone
I see your eyes
Like burning glass
Like burning glass
Hear you smile, smile, baby

The mask that you wore
My fingers would explore
Costume of control
Excitement soon unfolds, hey

Easy, baby

Call the queen
Be my bride
Raging darkness
By my side
Seize the summer
In your pride
Take the winter
In your stride

Let's ride, yeah
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum
Ride
