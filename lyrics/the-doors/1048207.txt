Well I'm tired, I'm nervous, I'm bored, I'm stoned
Don't you know life aint so easy when you're on your own
I'm lonely, I'm ugly, I'm horny, I'm cold
Don't you know life aint so easy when you're on your own
Leaving home


Well I got ripped off, wiped out, I got burned
Don't you know life aint so easy when you're on your own
I feel my mind is shaking out of place
I look like a truck ran over my face
The doctor says I'm not a hopeless case
I really want to join the human race

Well I got ripped off, wiped out, I got burned
Don't you know life aint so easy when you're on your own
Well I'm tired, I'm nervous, I'm bored, I'm stoned
Don't you know life aint so easy when you're on your own
Leaving home, on your own
On your own
