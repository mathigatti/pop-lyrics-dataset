I'm a spy
In the house of love
I know the dream
That you're dreamin' on
I know the word
That you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear


I'm a spy
In the house of love
I know the dream
That you're dreamin' on
I know the word
That you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear

I know everything
Everything you do
Everywhere you go
Everyone you know

I'm a spy
In the house of love
I know the dreams
That you're dreamin' on
I know the word
That you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear
I know your deepest secret fear
I know your deepest secret fear

I'm a spy
I can see you
What you do
And I know
