I'm gonna hang on your neck just like a verdilac
Take you for a ride in my cadillac
Well I tried, I tried but I can't make you understand
Baby can't you see I'm more than just a man


If you don't bring me coffee in my favourite cup
You're make it necessary for me to conjure up
Spirits
Spirits

I'm gonna hang on your neck just like good luck
Take you for a ride in my cadillac
Well I tried, I tried but I can't make you understand

If you don't bring me coffee in my favourite cup
You're make it necessary for me to conjure up
Spirits
Spirits
Spirits
Spirits
