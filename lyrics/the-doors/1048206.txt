Don't need none today
His mind has gone astray
'Cause we don't need none today
Did you hear what I say?
Don't need none today


Gonna run a rainbow ragged
City life's a real bad habit
All the boys are down on the farm

Gonna run a rainbow ragged
City life's a real bad habit
C'mon along it won't do you no harm
We're goin' down on the farm

Don't need none today
His mind has gone astray
'Cause we don't need none today
Did you hear what I say?
Don't need none today

Gonna run a rainbow ragged
City life's a real bad habit
All the boys are down on the farm

Gonna run a rainbow
Gonna run a rainbow
Gonna run a rainbow
Gonna run a rainbow

Gonna run a rainbow ragged
City life's a real bad habit
C'mon along it won't do you no harm
All the boys are down on the farm
