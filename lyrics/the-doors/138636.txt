I really want you, really do 
Really need ya baby, God knows I do 
'Cause I'm not real enough without you 
Oh, what can I do? 


You make me real 
You make me feel like lovers feel 
You make me throw away mistaken misery 
Make me free, love, make me free 

I really want you, really do 
Really need ya baby, really do 
Well I'm not real enough without you 
Oh, what can I do? 

You make me real 
Only you have that appeal 
So let me slide in your tender sunken sea 
Make me free, love, make me free 

You make me real 
You make me feel like lovers feel 
You make me throw away mistaken misery 
Make me free, love, make me free 
Make me free 
You make me real
