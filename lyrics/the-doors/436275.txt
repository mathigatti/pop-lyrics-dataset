Me and the devil
Walking side by side
Me and the devil
Going to take you on a long and evil ride
The woman is a devil
That's what I've been told
Woman is a devil
That's what I've been told
She'll take all your money
Then she'll spend all your gold
All right
The devil is a woman
She's a woman
Well I play my acts, honey
She take the whole damn role
Keep on going, now, come on
All right play it, yeah
One more time
Well she feel like dying
Only twenty-one
Well she feel like dying
But she's only twenty-one
She's not the only
She's not the only one
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right
Gonna save the whole world
All right
