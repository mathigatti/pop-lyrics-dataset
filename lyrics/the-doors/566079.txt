Well baby you been away so long woman
Yeah baby, you've been away so long
Well come on back baby
Cos your man wants you home


My little baby weighs about five hundred pounds
My little baby weighs about five hundred pounds
When my woman makes love
Boys you oughta come around

Well were fighting in the war
Tears are gonna fall
Oh baby, well it's alright
I'm going home, back where I belong

Oh Detroit
You're lookin' good tonight
I feel good in Detroit City
Do you know what the blues is?
You know
I know you people know out there
Cos I can feel ya
I can feel you boogying all night
