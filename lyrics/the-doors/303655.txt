For seven years I dwelt 
In the loose palace of exile,
Playing strange games 
With the girls of the island. 
Now I have come again 
To the land of the fair, &amp; the strong, &amp; the wise. 


Brothers &amp; sisters of the pale forest
Children of Night 
Who among you will run with the hunt? 

Now Night arrives with her purple legion. 
Retire now to your tents &amp; to your dreams. 
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth. 
I want to be ready. 

The Doors! The Doors! 
We're out of time, thank you very much. We're out of time. 

All right, we've got time for one more, let's do it one more
time.
