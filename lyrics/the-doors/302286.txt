We came down
The rivers &amp; highways
We came down from
Forests &amp; falls
We came down from
Carson &amp; Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled


&amp; I can tell you
The names of the Kindom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade
