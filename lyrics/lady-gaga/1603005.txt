We've got nothing left to lose but limousines and attitudes
Yeah, we're banking on us baby it's crazy
We've got nothing left to make but icing on this little cake
Fashion sense and vanity consume us cause we


We want that Kandy Life
For me I'd like that Kandy Life
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life
I know our style might be abridged
But we are the ones, bitch

We got sour grapes to fry to limit this credit card life
We're banking on hits baby it's crazy
We've got nothing left to lose but reservations and good booze
Copy me celebrities consume us cause we

We want that Kandy Life
For me I'd like that Kandy Life
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life
I know our style might be abridged
But we are the ones, bitch

I say change your pants and meet me in the
Bathroom for a private tour and dance
We'll share our candy, I'm not your buddy
Baby vanity's for me, copy me cause we

We want that Kandy Life
For me I'd like that Kandy Life
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life
I know our style might be abridged
But we are the ones, bitch
