Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
Laying down on famous knives so everybody sees


Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I know could love and save me from myself
Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you

I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong

Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you

Hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been tryna tell you how I feel but was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
I'll do it in the swimming pool so everybody sees

Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Volumes I know will love and save me from myself
Maybe I'll just keep clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you

Princess die
I want to see her cry
Princess die
Princess die
I wanna watch her cry
Princess die

I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriend's limo
Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold

With the paparazzi all swarming around
In my Louis Vuitton white buttoned down
Oh it's not that deep

Bob your head for another dead blonde
Who's real prince is in heaven
She just wants to sleep

Princess die
I want to see her cry
Princess die
Princess die
We wanna watch her cry
Princess die

The final act of life will be in my own hands to do
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you
