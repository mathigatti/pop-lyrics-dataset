I can't believe what you said to me
Last night we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby, you gave up, you gave up
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies


Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
On my bubble dreams, bubble dreams
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

And I know that it's complicated
But I'm a loser in love, so baby
Raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends

I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh, friend, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

How? How? How? Wow
How? How? How? Wow

And after all the drinks
And bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up?
Could I give it all up for you?
And after all the boys
And the girls who we've been through
Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up if I promise, boy, to you

That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again?
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again
So speechless
You left me speechless, so speechless
Why you so speechless, so speechless?

Will you ever talk again?
Oh boy, why you so speechless?
You've left me speechless, so speechless
Some men may follow me
But you choose death and company
Why you so speechless? Oh, oh
