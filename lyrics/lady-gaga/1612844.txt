(Let them hoes die)
Stop stressin' on me for the attention
(Let them hoes fight)
You're excused, you're no competition
(Let them hoes die)
Stop comin' at me, guns are a blazin'
(Let them hoes fight)
Hold up bitch, I could stomp your face in


Trina
I was lookin' hella good
When I stepped off in the club
She was jockin' on my Gucci
I don't care what you heard
Watch me lookin' hella good
I keep throwin' her the bird
I'm about to walk away
I don't care what you heard

Watch me, watch me swing my weave
I'm gon', I'm gon' fix my lip gloss
I'm gon' stunt on them hoes
With my hands up on my hip bones singin'
Jealous bitches, jealous bitches
Don't hate me, don't hate me
