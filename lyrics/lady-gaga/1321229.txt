Hey there sugar baby, saw you twice at the pop show
You taste just like glitter mixed with rock and roll
I like you a lot, lot, think you're really hot, hot
Know you think you're special when we dance real crazy
Glam-aphonic, electronic, disco baby
I like you a lot, lot, all we want is hot, hot


Boys, boys, boys! We like boys in cars
Boys, boys, boys! Buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys! With hairspray and denim
Boys, boys, boys! We love them!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Baby is a bad boy with some retro sneakers
Let's go see The Killers and make out in the bleachers
I like you a lot, lot, think you're really hot, hot
Let's go to the party, heard our buddies' the DJ
Don't forget my lipstick, I left it in your ashtray
I like you a lot, lot, all we want is hot, hot

Boys, boys, boys! We like boys in cars
Boys, boys, boys! Buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys! With hairspray and denim
Boys, boys, boys! We love them!

Boys, boys, boys! We like boys in cars
Boys, boys, boys! Buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys! With hairspray and denim
Boys, boys, boys! We love them!

I'm not loose, I like to party
Let's get lost in your Ferrari
Not psychotic or dramatic
I like boys and that is that
Love it when you call me legs
In the morning buy me eggs
Watch your heart when we're together
Boys like you love me forever

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Boys, boys, boys! We like boys in cars
Boys, boys, boys! Buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys! With hairspray and denim
Boys, boys, boys! We love them!

Boys, boys, boys! We like boys in cars
Boys, boys, boys! Buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys! With hairspray and denim
Boys, boys, boys! We love them!

Boys, boys, boys! We like boys in cars
Boys, boys, boys! Buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys! With hairspray and denim
