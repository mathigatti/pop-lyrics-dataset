You're killin' me baby with the things you do
Put me in the ground before we're through
Burnin' up this town
Spendin' everythin' I've saved
Yeah
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave


Every little lie you tell can't keep it hid
You're just another nail on the coffin lid
Someone else is gettin' all the love you never gave
Woo, yeah
And you've been up all night
Diggin' my grave, yeah

So keep on runnin' around
Ain't no need to hurry back
Cause I'll be gone from here
And you'll be all dressed up in black

Six feet under baby that's where I'll be
By the time that you're done with me
All these tears I cry
Drownin' in a tidal wave
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave

So keep on runnin' around
Ain't no need to hurry back
Cause I'll be gone from here
And you'll be all dressed up in black
Woo

Six feet under baby that's where I'll be
By the time that you're done with me
All these tears I cry
Drownin' in a tidal wave
Yeah, yeah
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave

Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my
Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my
Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my grave
Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my
Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my
Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my grave
