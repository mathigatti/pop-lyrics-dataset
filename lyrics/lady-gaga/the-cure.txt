I'll undress you, 'cause you're tired
Cover you as you desire
When you fall asleep inside my arms
May not have the fancy things
But I'll give you everything
You could ever want, it's in my arms


So, baby, tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So, baby, tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So, baby, tell me yes
And I will give you everything
I will be right by your side

If I can't find the cure, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you know, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure
(Be the cure)

Rub your feet, your hands, your legs
Let me take care of it, babe
Close your eyes, I'll sing your favorite song
I wrote you this lullaby
Hush now, baby, don't you cry
Anything you want could not be wrong

So, baby, tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So, baby, tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So, baby, tell me yes
And I will give you everything
I will be right by your side

If I can't find the cure, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you know, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure
(Be the cure)

I'll fix you with my love
(I'll fix you with my love-lo-love)
I'll fix you with my love
(I'll fix you with my love-lo-love)

If I can't find the cure, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you know, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure
(Be the cure)

Promise I'll be the cure
(Be the cure)

I'll fix you with my love
