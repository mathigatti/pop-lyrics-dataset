Girl's muscles in my bones
But I'm too poor to pay the penance
You know the cadilac's her man
But I don't have a licence


I drive, I'm mean
Boys that I choose
Never come out clean

I doubt you are sleeping
And dreaming 'bout me on your own
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, don't

Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's not nice

Yeah, my little rapture
Boy, I think maybe I'll capture it
Yeah, you met your matcher
You know you've met the master heartbreaker

Well there's a devil in my mouth
And when you kiss I'll pull him out
Trust me my love is sworn
Up with my bros we're sitting on

I kiss, I'm mean
Boys like you
They never come out clean

And while you are cursing
And crying 'cause I sent you home
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, don't

Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's not nice

Yeah, my little rapture
Boy, I think maybe I'll capture it
Yeah, you met your matcher
You know you've met the master heartbreaker

Huh, huh huh, huh
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, huh, huh, huh

Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's, no she's not nice

Yeah, my little rapture
Boy, I think maybe I'll capture, oh yeah
Yeah, you met your matcher
You know you've met the master heartbreaker

Heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heartbreaker
