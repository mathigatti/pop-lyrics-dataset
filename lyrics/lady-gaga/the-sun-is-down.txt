The sun is down
The sun is down
The sun is down
It's getting so dark
What is stars? Or the moon?
The stars should shine the river.. Up


Maybe the river even to cold for them (hmm)
The sun is down
The sun is down
The sun is down, it's getting so dark.

That mirror, oh that mirror!
I'm throwing away the mirror, in the river
I don't need it,
I can walk without it (yeah)
It's time for me to,
Go on a walk (uh!)
You know

The sun is down
The sun is down
The sun is down, it's getting so dark.
Does that matter? Yeah I like it! Uuuh!
(I... My own....)
And when I'm alone I like to walk
Caressed by the wind and nobody else

The sun is down
The sun is down
The sun is down, it's getting so dark
The suns is down in the secret garden
