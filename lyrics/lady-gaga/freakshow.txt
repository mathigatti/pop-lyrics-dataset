‘Cause I guarantee you’ve never seen
A show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can’t ignore
Wanna take a peek!?
Then open up the curtains
Baby it’s a freakshow
Cause I guarantee you’ve never seen
A show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can’t ignore
Wanna take a peek!?
Then open up the curtains
Baby it’s a freakshow


I wanna know, what do you like?
What would you say, if I said I’d
Do anything to you you want?
I wanna know, yeah it’s alright
New positions, bet you would like
You’ve been screamin’: Stop, yes, please, hon
Baby you’ve got tricks in my head
Craziest chick you’ve ever had
I heard what you said in your sleep
You wanna win, you wanna mend
I like it rough, I like it fast
I know that deep down you’re a freak

You say the mention once and I’ll come
I’ll hypnotize you
You’re gonna lose your mind, don’t you know?
Cause baby it’s a freakshow

Cause I guarantee you’ve never seen
A show like this before
Gonna show you something
That you can’t ignore
Wanna take a peek?
Then open up the curtains
Baby it’s a freakshow
Cause I guarantee you’ve never seen
A show like this before
Gonna show you something
That you can’t ignore
Cause I’m sure by now
You’re tired of being certain
Baby it’s a freakshow
Baby it’s a freakshow

When you’re alone what do you dream?
I wanna know your fantasy
Don’t matter how wrong it might be
I wanna see, know what it means
Psycho and fun, sexy and mean
It’s just different when you’re with me
I want it all, I got a spell
Put it on you and I won’t tell
Your secret ’cause I am your slave
You want it hard, you want it tough
I like it long, never enough
I promise that I won’t behave

You say the mention once and I’ll come
I’ll hypnotize you
You’re gonna lose your mind, don’t you know?
Cause baby it’s a freakshow

Cause I guarantee you’ve never seen
A show like this before
Gonna show you something
That you can’t ignore
Wanna take a peek?
Then open up the curtains
Baby it’s a freakshow
Cause I guarantee you’ve never seen
A show like this before
Gonna show you something
That you can’t ignore
Cause I’m sure by now
You’re tired of being certain
