This is the Manifesto of Little Mons?ers
There is something heroic about
The way my fans operate their cameras


So precisely, so intricately and so proudly
Like Kings writing the history of their people
Is their prolific nature that both creates and procures
What will later be percieved as the kingdom

So the real truth about Lady Gaga fans
My little monsters, lies in this sentiment:
They are the Kings, they are the Queens
They write the history of the kingdom and
I am something of a devoted Jester
It is in the theory of perception that we have established our bond
Or the lie I should say, for which we kill

We are nothing without our image, without our projection
Without the spiritual hologram of who we percieve ourselves
To be or rather to become, in the future

When you are lonely
I'll be lonely too
And this is the fame

Love and Art
