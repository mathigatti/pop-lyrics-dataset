Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown


I lay around, touch myself to pass the time
I feel down, I wish you were mine
I close my eyes, take a breath and I picture us
In a place I can't recognize

In the fire I call your name out
(Call your name out, call your name out)
Up full night tryin' to rub the pain out
(Rub the pain out)

I'm singin'
Baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

I fool myself
Swirl around as if I'm someone else
Your hands are mine
I do a trick
Pretend that I am you until it clicks
I come alive
Come alive

In the fire I call your name out
(Call your name out, call your name out)
Up full night tryin' to rub the pain out
(Rub the pain out)

I'm singin'
Baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

Hurts inside, but not this time
All the things that are on my mind
Vanish as I touch myself
Call out loud for you
Oh, can you hear me singin'?

Baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown
