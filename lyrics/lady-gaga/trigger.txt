In the white room, with the yellow chair
Was her baby, with his angry stare
In the white room, through their violet eyes
Shes just a baby taken by surprise


They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a-ding
They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a-ding

In the white room, she had jet black hair
She held his head down, but he left her there
In the white room, you could hear their cries
Sound of a baby heard his very first lie

They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a-ding
They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a-ding

Ring, ring, ring
She goes
The telephone, the telephone
Ring, ring, ring
She goes
The telephone, the telephone

They never really knew it then
How to do it when
He had her
They never really knew it then
How to do it with
The safety off the trigger
