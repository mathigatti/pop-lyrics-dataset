It's over,
It's over.


You're like the definition of negative.
Always complainin', you're such a pessimist.
(Your) Cup is always half empty.
I'm just so sick of it.
I got a different perspective.

(My) Cup is half full.
(My) Sky is never gray.
(You...) You cant bring be down anymore baby.
(My) Future is bright.
(Cant) Wait to face the day.
There's one thing you should know about me. (Mee...)

Im an optimist. (Stop!)
So positive. (Bitch!)
You'll never get another chance with me baby.
Im an optimist. (Out!)
So positive. (Bitch!)
Your chances blown, boy you're gone, spread your negativity.

(I'm an optimist, toppop-timist-toppop-timist)

You're such a downer, You're never satisfied.
Lucky for me, there's always a silver line.
On the horizon, so boy dont even try.
Injectin' me with your negative vibes.

I'm spontanious.
I need fun and excitement, ready set.

Grab life by the horns, While i'm still young.
And If you wanna act old, If you wanna be cold.
