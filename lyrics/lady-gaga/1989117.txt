If you want me, meet me at electric chapel
If you want me, meet me at electric chapel
If you want to steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
Come on, meet me in electric chapel

My body is a sanctuary, my blood is pure
Doo-doo-roo
Doo-doo-doo-roo
You want me bad, I think you're cool
But I'm not sure

Doo-doo-roo
Doo-doo-doo-roo

Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something more from you
It's not about sex or champagne, you holy fool

Doo-doo-roo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (doo)

If you want me, meet me at electric chapel
If you want to steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place

Ohh-o-h-o-h

Don't ask to me where you have been (next to the bar)
Doo-doo-roo
Doo-doo-doo-roo
Pray for your sins, right all the wrong (qu'est-ce que la foi?)
Doo-doo-roo
Doo-doo-doo-roo

Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something sacred from you
Together, we'll both find a way to make pure love work in a dirty way

If you want me, meet me at electric chapel
If you want me, meet me at electric chapel
If you want to steal my heart away

In electric chapel
