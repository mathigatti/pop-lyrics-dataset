I've got to turn on ya
For the minute I saw
That style and your swagger
You're so predictable


Trust me I already know
Inside you're just a man ho
I don't wanna know
You're so predictable

Got on my white gloves and my criminal kit
You'd be surprised, how I've got you down
Even got your fingerprints

Trust me I already know
Inside you're just a man, ho
Known about you for a while
Baby 'cause I've got your file

Double O seven on you

Put you on lockdown
Gonna be quarantined
I've got a few questions that need some answering

You don't even wanna know
What I got on you 'cause whoa
Baby, you're just a man ho
I don't mess with no man ho

Heard about your girl
Back at home from your friends
You'd be surprised how I've got you down
Even if you still pretend

Trust me I already know
Inside you're just a man ho
Known about you for a while
Baby 'cause I've got your file
