I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall


'Cause inside, we are really made the same
In life, waiting's just a stupid game

Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves

I'd do anything if you would just believe me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall
If I had a painter's mind, then I would paint it
Or a sculptor's hands, then I would shape it
But instead, I guess I'll sing it in this song

I cry more than I ever say
Each time, your love seems to save the day

Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
