Sometimes
My heart, sometimes
Feels so black


In the dunes of sand
And other days
My heart feels like rainbows

Amen
Jesus is the new black

I am mugler woman
I am quiet
I am strong
Amen

Don’t fuck with me
Don’t fuck with mugler
Don’t f- f-
Don’t fuck with mugler woman

Take me, paris

Do not anger a mugler woman
She will eat you
