I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream


So do what u want, what u want with my body
Do what u want, don't stop, let's party
Do what u want, what u want with my body
Do what u want, what u want with my body

Write what u want, say what u want about me
If you're wonderin' know that I'm not sorry
Do what u want, what u want with my body
What u want with my body

U can't have my heart and u won't use my mind, but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body
U can't stop my voice, cause u don't own my life but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body

My bones hurt
From all the shows
But I don't feel the pain cause I'm pro, I
I sink in
Then I'm okay
Cause my body belongs to you
When I'm on stage

So do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
Don't stop, let's party
Do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body

Write what you want
Say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know
That I'm not sorry
Do what you want
What you want with my body
What you want with my body

You can't have my heart and
You won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party

You can't have my heart and
You won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world

Help me now
What you want with my body, world
