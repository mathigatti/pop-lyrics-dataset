Even after everything we’ve seen
We’ve barely caught a glimpse of what it means
In the architecture of the soul
The universe began with our eyes closed


We claim our land
We tame our seas
We carve our names
On the surface of history
Til our hands get tied
By the stubborn will
Of gravity

Even after everything we’ve seen
We’ve barely caught a glimpse of what it means
In the architecture of the soul
The universe began with our eyes closed

In the rise and fall
Of a newborn’s chest
Like the ocean swells
We inhale, exhale and reset
Every living thing
Is in this constant state of unrest

Even after all our history
We’ve barely caught a glimpse of what it means
In the architecture of the soul
The universe began

Even after everything we’ve seen
We’ve barely caught a glimpse of what it means
In the architecture of the soul
The universe began with our eyes closed
