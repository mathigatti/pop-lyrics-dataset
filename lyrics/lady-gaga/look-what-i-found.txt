One, two, three

I'm alone in my house
I'm out on the town
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
I'm been knockin' them down


I can't get back up on my feet
See the lights on the street like stars

But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

Under the foggy day
I’m looking for a light
And my only friend
Is working tonight

I can’t get myself out of bed
Hear these voices in my head like a song

But look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what I found
Somebody who carry
Round a piece of my heart
Just laying on the ground

When I met you I was blown to pieces
Heart all over the floor
Ever since you put me back together
I can’t believe it, can’t believe it

Look what you found, yeah, baby
Look what I found
Someone who carry
Round a piece of my heart
Look what I found
Woo, c'mon

Look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what we found
Someone who carry
Round a piece of my heart, heart
Just layin' on the ground
