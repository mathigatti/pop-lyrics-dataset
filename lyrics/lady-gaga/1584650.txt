I love that lavender blonde
The way she moves
The way she walks
I touch myself can't get enough

And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears
And all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright

Just give in
Don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me

Just know when
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend

Happy in the club, with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) so happy I could die

Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) so happy I could die, and it's alright

Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha

Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha

I am as vain as I allow
I do my hair
I gloss my eyes
I touch myself all through the night

And when something fall out of place
I take my time
I put it back
I touch myself till I'm on track

Just give in
Don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me

Just know when
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend

Happy in the club, with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) so happy I could die

Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) so happy I could die, and it's alright

So happy I could die, and it's alright
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
So happy I could die, and it's alright

Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha

Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha

Happy in the club, with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) so happy I could die

Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) so happy I could die, and it's alright

Happy in the club, with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) so happy I could die

Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) so happy I could die, and it's alright
