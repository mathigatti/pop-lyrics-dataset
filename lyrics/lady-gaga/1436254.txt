I can't remember when
You looked to me and cried,
Said something broke inside of you...
Were my best friend
But ever come our way,
You know I'm your girl till the end


And I finally go away
I know you'll look for me one day (Ooh)

when you let love down, oh you let love down
I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
When you let love down, oh you let me down
Can you let our love down oh own, let it down oh own

I can't remember when
You put your hand on mine
But coudn't play in time when we
were not together
Just sing our little song
Blueberry kisses forever

And I finally go away
I know you'll look for me one day
Oh yeah, it's so sad

When you let love down, oh you let love down
I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
When you let love down, oh you let me down
Can you let our love down oh own, let it down oh own

Oooh Oooh
Don't let me down
Oh Don't let me down
Oooh Oooh

When you let love down, oh you let love down
I don't have to remind, but you know that I'm around
When you let love down, oh you let me down
Don't let me down oh own, let it down oh own
Can you let our love down oh own, let it down oh own
Never let our love down oh own, let it down oh own
