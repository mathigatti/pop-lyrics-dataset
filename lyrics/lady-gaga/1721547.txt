Never seen so many purple doubts
Situation's inside out


Love sick girl
Where does it hurt?
Where does it hurt?
The temperature's goodbye
But don't look me in the eye

'Cause you know
I spin U around
Spin U around
Spin U around

Spin U around
Spin U around
Spin U around

Body lays inside the broken glass
How did we make such a mess?

Love sick girl
Where does it hurt?
Where does it hurt?
The temperature's goodbye
But don't look me in the eye

'Cause you know
I spin U around
Spin U around
Spin U around

Spin U around
Spin U around
Spin U around

Love's not something you can fix
Sound of phobic music stick
I get lost in everything you say
Something about you and me
Has made our steam a little mean
But I prefer us both that way

I spin U around
Spin U around
Spin U around

I spin u around
Spin U around
Spin U around

Around
And around
And around
And around
And around

Around
And around
And around
And around
And around

Around, around, around
