Lady Gaga:
Uuuuuu
Something about you
Makes me wanna loose
All control
I just fall in the hoop
Somehow you
Get my thoughts
I just thank you
Got me hypnotized
By eyes but I can’t fall
You got me out of the spell
Somebody get me out of the spell
I end up hating my self
The situation can’t go well
I can´t figure what is true
I don’t know what to do
I promise but you already knew
That I end up hurting you


Lady Gaga and Asher Roth:
The situation can’t go right
When wrong really can’t go right
I promise I wouldn’t do what I did
And now we are here and it makes us sick

Asher Roth:
I got to tell it but, I don’t know what to say see
Now my dirty conscience come to place she
Set 4 you got something to say?
I just said there where nothing in pay
Before I make that decision at all huu
Think about the moments that we caught
Nights at the park, late night walks,
Nights on the car late night course
Buuut haaa
Caught wasn’t the only one I toke,
I toke love 4 game huu what a croke
We pinky promise we weren’t thoughts
Freud’s honest look at the spot
Look at this book I can write with touché
We were so good but I divided the kiss
I’m full of ... every lie every bliss ... how I supussed to do this

Lady Gaga and Asher Roth:
The situation can’t go right
When wrong really can’t go right
I promise I wouldn’t do what I did
And now we are here and it makes us sick
Huuuu
Something about you
Makes me wanna
Core up, so core up

Lady Gaga:
There’s something you need to know
Back when young up the phone

Asher Roth:
Baby girl you should sit down 4 this
You might not like the sound of this
Cause…

Lady Gaga:
Nooo I have to tell you first
Before the thing can get any worst

Lady Gaga and Asher Roth:
Well…
I haven’t been telling the true,
And I haven’t been faithful to you.
The situation can’t go right
When wrong really can’t go right
I promise I wouldn’t do what I did
And now we are here and it makes us sick
