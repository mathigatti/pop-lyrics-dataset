Hush up, don't speak don't wanna hear another
Not another word (from you)
You're just a ani-mal, tryin' to act real special
But deep down you are (just a shrew)


Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
Cuz it's when I'm not thinking with you
That I act like a swine
Act like a swine, act like a swine

I know I know I know I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya I know I know I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Swine! Swine! Swine!

Swine!

Be that hog sweat it out you squeala
Let your body jiggle
Slap her skin-he, love to watch her ass go wiggle
It's the feel of ecstasy

Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cuz it's when I'm not thinking with you
That I act like a swine
Act like a swine, act like a swine
I know I know I know I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body

Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya I know I know I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Swine! Swine! Swine!
Swine!

Paint your face and
Paint his face and (catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Paint her face and (catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Be a swine just (catch the beat)
For the weekend
Catch the beat
Swine!
