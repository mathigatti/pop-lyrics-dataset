Corks off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this
Drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Cuz I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins
Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'd hate myself until I die


My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, Bell Bottom Blue
I'll keep on searching for an answer, cause I need you more than dope

I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

Toast one last puff
And two last regrets
Three spirits and
Twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul
Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high

My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low, from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, Bell Bottom Blue
I'll keep on searching for an answer, cause I need you more than dope

I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

I need you more
Need you more
I need you more than dope
