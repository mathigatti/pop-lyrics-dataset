How could you ever let me go
How could you ever-ever let me, go-ooh
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young
Guitar, guitar


No, I just can't seem to forget you
Not ever just as long as I left you
You're my baby, you
never made it through, to you

If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
And here on this planet, there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
There was an earthquake
If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
And here on this planet, there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
There was an earthquake

How could you ever let me go
How could you ever-ever let me, go-ooh

I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young
Guitar, guitar
No, I just can't seem to forget you
Not ever just as long as I left you
You're my baby, you
never made it through, to you

If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
And here on this planet, there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
There was an earthquake
If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
And here on this planet, there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
There was an earthquake

If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
And here on this planet, there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
There was an earthquake
If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
And here on this planet, there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
There was an earthquake
