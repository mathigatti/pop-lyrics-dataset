Everybody just clap your hands
just clap your hands and have a ball yah
...
Everybody just clap your hands
..and have a ball yah (clap yours hands)
Everybody just clap your hands
and have a ball yah


I've been looking
been trying
Continuousy seeking
and searching and burning
explore and then hunting
...and everywhere..
For that powerful foutain
The fountain of the truth

No answer at all
in the streets or the mall
I saw at the auction
That raging emotion
Nothing is stable
I'm really not able
to find that powerful foutain,
The fountain of the truth

(RAP by Melle)
