[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
You make me feel so pretty
When i'm not feeling so cool today
Yeah, you pull me out when you know that i'm afraid
Something about you, it dries up every tear in the way
And when i trip myself on the sidewalk
You put my boots back on me babe
Cause you're my cowboy, you're my everything
And you know when you get me


[Chorus]
Sometimes i'm feeling up, sometimes i'm down
You lift my feet up off the ground
Sometimes i'm moving fast, sometimes i'm slow
You know where to make me go
Sometimes i am a happy girl you love, sometimes i don't feel good enough
Sometimes, sometimes, oh
You're there when i need you sometimes! uh oh! uh oh!
When i need you sometimes, uh oh! uh oh!

[Verse 2]
Ask myself these questions
About you that i cannot explain
How you ride with me when you know that i'm the plane
You put your love out don't need to hear the words that you say
But i know you'll say them anyway
Just to keep me feeling sane
And the words become a yesterday
And baby you get me!

[Chorus]
Sometimes i'm feeling up, sometimes i'm down
You lift my feet up off the ground
Sometimes i'm moving fast, sometimes i'm slow
You know where to make me go
Sometimes i am a happy girl you love, sometimes i don't feel good enough
Sometimes, sometimes, oh
You're there when i need you sometimes! uh oh! uh oh!
When i need you sometimes, uh oh! uh oh!

[Bridge]
And the words become a yesterday
Cause baby you that know i...
