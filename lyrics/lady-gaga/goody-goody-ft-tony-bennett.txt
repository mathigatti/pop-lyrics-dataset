So you met someone who set you back on your heels?
Goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels (Tony!)
Goody goody!
So you gave him your heart too
Just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces
Now how do you do? (Well, I miss you)


So you lie awake
Singing the blues all night
Goody goody!
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite?
Hurray and hallelujah!
You had it coming to ya
Goody goody for him (oh, c'mon, Tony!)
Goody goody for me (won't you take me back?)
And I hope you're satisfied, you rascal you
(I'm not a rascal! I'm just a baddy baddy)

So you met someone who set you back on your heels
Goody goody! (He's nothing like you)
So you met someone and now you know how it feels
Goody goody! (I don't like how it feels)
So you gave him your heart too
Just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces
Now, how do you do? (Why you break my heart, Tony?)

So you lie awake
Singing the blues all night (Yeah, I am)
Goody goody!
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite
Hurray and hallelujah!
You had it coming to ya (come on!)
Goody goody for him
Goody goody for me (I'm just a baddy baddy)
Love has win tonight
You've been taken for a ride
And I hope you're satisfied, you rascal you
Oh, come on, Tony, won't you take me back?
I'm not so bad!
