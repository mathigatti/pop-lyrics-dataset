Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination


I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this
Brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake up in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?

And I say: Hey! Yeah yeaaah, Hey yeah yea
I said hey, what's going on?

And I say: Hey! Yeah yeaaah, Hey yeah yea
I said hey, what's going on?

Ooh, ooh ooh

And I try, oh my god do I try
I try all the time, in this institution

And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution

And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake up in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?

And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what's going on?

Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
