It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
Dooa, doa, doa, doa, doa, doa
No, it don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is swing
Dooa, doa, doa, doa, doa, doa
Makes no difference if it's sweet or it's hot
Give all that rhythm that you've got


Oh, It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
Dooa, doa, doa, doa, doa, doa, Tony, Gaga

It's makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give to the rhythm everything you got

Oh, It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
Dooa, doa, doa, doa, doa, doa
Dooa, doa, doa, doa, doa, doa
Dooa, doa, doa, doa, doa, doa
