Open-minded, I'm so blinded
Mystery man, woman phantom
Violet light smears the atmosphere
I'm so scared, but I'm standing here


Is what I am seeing real, or is it just a sign?
Is it all just virtual?

We could be lovers, even just tonight
We could be anything you want
We could be jokers, brought to the daylight
We could break all of our stigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma

Can't stop staring, I'm so naked
Wrapped in shadows, my heart races
Dragon's eyes watch, goddess breathing
Give me something to believe in

Is what I am seeing real, or is it just a sign?
Is it all just virtual?

We could be lovers, even just tonight
We could be anything you want
We could be jokers, brought to the daylight
We could break all of our stigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma

Did you hear what I said? (What?)
Did you hear what I said? (Yeah)
Is it all in my head?
Is it all in my head? (Ooh, yeah)
Is it all in my head?

We could be lovers, even just tonight
We could be anything you want
We could be jokers, brought to the daylight
We could break all of our stigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma, even just tonight
I'll, I'll be your enigma, brought to the daylight
I'll, I'll be your enigma, even just tonight
I'll, I'll be your enigma, brought to the daylight, daylight
