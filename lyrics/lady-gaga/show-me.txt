Say, say what you wanna say say
Tell it to me every day, day
But if you don't show me
Words, words all they are is words words
Stupid poetry and first, first, do you even know me?
That first thing that I saw in your eyes
Did you mean, or was it only lies? Only lies?
About, about have you ever thought about
How this is supposed to go, yeah
So do you know, do you, oh!


Love is not a gimme, gimme
If you really with me you gotta
Show me, show me
Show me, show me
Tell it to me with your mouth
But when it all comes down
You gotta show me, show me
Show me, show me
You can say it feels right, say it to me all night
I don't think you understand
Love is not a gimmie, gimmie
If you really with me you gotta show me
Show me, show me
Show me love
Show me love, eyes, eyes, open up your eyes
Don't hide what you got inside inside
If you wanna know me
Hey, hey, I'm not gonna stay, stay
Keep it with you night and day, day
No, if you don't show me
Everything hidden in your heart
All your feels every single part, single part
About, about, have you ever thought about?
How this is supposed to go, yeah
Do you know, do you, oh!

Love is not a gimme, gimme
If you really with me you gotta
Show me, show me
Show me, show me
Tell it to me with your mouth
But when it all comes down
You gotta show me, show me
Show me, show me
You can say it feels right, say it to me all night
I don't think you understand, oh!
Love is not a gimmie, gimmie
If you really with me you gotta show me
Show me, show me
Show me love
Show me love, everything you got, is everything you need!
Everything you want is inside of me!

Love is not a gimme, gimme
If you really with me you gotta
Show me, show me
Ye-ye-yeah

Tell it to me with your mouth
But when it all comes down
You gotta show me, show me
Show me, show me
If you can say it feels right, say it to me all night
I don't think you understand, oh
Love is not a gimmie, gimmie
If you really with me you gotta show me
Show me, show me
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
Show me
