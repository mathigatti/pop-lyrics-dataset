Hey there sugar baby
Saw you twice at the pop show
You taste just like glitter
Mixed with rock n' roll
I like you a lot lot
Think you're really hot hot
Know you think you're special
When we dance real crazy
Glamophonic
Electronic
Disco baby
I like you a lot, lot
All we want is hot, hot

Baby is a bad boy
With some retro sneakers
Let's go see the killers
And make out in the bleachers
I like you a lot, lot
Think you're really hot, hot
Let's go to the party
Heard our buddy' the DJ
Don't forget my lipstick
I left it in your ashtray
I like you a lot, lot
All we want is hot, hot

I'm not loose, ilike to party
Let's get lost in your Ferrari
Not psychotic or dramatic
I like boys and that is that
Love it when you call me legs
In the morning buy me eggs
Watch your heart
When we're together
Boys like you love me for ever
