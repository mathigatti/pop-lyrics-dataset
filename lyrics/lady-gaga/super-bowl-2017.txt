God Bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her, and guide her
Through the night with the light from above


This land is your land
This land is my land
This land was made for you and me

One nation, under God
Indivisible
With liberty and justice for all

(J-j-just dance)
(Let's play a love game, play a love game)
(Pa-pa-paparazzi)

I'm on the edge

(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)

I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas Plays
One, two, three!
Fold 'em, let 'em, hit me, raise it
Baby, stay with me
LoveGame intuition play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked
I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
Come on Houston!
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me to love nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

There's nothin' wrong with lovin' who you are
She said: 'Cause he made you perfect, babe
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way

Ooo, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby, you were born this way

No matter gay, straight or bi
Lesbian, transgendered life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white or beige
Chola or orient made
Right track, baby
I was born to be brave

Hello, hello, baby, you called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you see, see
Wha-wha-what did you say? Oh, you're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You shoulda made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kinda busy

Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my hand and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush (start to rush by)
A dizzi twister dance
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone

What's goin' on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, alright

Just dance, gonna be okay
Da da doo doot-n
Just dance, spin that record babe
Da da doo doot-n
Just dance, gonna be okay
D-d-d dance, dance, dance
Dance

How you doing tonight, Texas?
America, world
How you doin' tonight?
We gonna make you feel good
You gonna feel good with us?

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
You're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a millio-on

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Hey dad! Hi mom!

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a millio-on
(About a million reasons)

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one
Why don't you stay?
Stay
