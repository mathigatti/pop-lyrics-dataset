Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together, dancing cheek to cheek


Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together, dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

And I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through

To heaven (heaven)
Yes, I'm in heaven (I'm in heaven)
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together, dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through

To heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
Oh, Tony, when we're out together, dancing
Out together, dancing
Out together, dancing cheek to cheek
