We are a generation twisted by a myth
Confused and ludicrous
Holding onto love


Consumed by all the pleasures in out midst
A life with all the lips we've kissed
And losing all control

We're gonna start a resistance.
We want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this.

Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
we'll live together in peace, love,
Solitude and happiness
Electric Kiss

Fame is our felony
We're so in love with it
Some superstars and masochists
Who dont know where to go

But the poets and the fighters of our time
Put down their weapons and their rounds
And know what they must do

They're gonna start a resistance
They want independence
Theyre gonna give the world some of this

Electric Kiss.
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love,
Solitude and happiness

Electric Kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips

Oh, one voice forever
We'll live together in oeace, Love,
Solitude and happiness
Electric kiss, kiss.
