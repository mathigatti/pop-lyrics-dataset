Let's get into trouble
Lots of trouble, rock star
You know how to rock hard
Hello midnight lover, lover
Hold that lady tighter
Shoot that bullet through her

My heart beats just like a cherry soda
In the summer
Go, go, go, don't be difficult about it
Get off it

Off the wall, get your ass
Off the wall, throw that girl
Against the wall, Retro-Physical

Off the walls, get your ass
Off the walls, move that boy
So sexual, Retro-Physical

Let's get down to business
Funny business
In the middle of the night he
Starts to get feisty
Don't forget your money, little honey
There are killer and blonde bunnies
They dance for money

My heart beats just like a cherry soda
In the summer
Go, go, go, don't be difficult about it
Get off it

Off the wall, get your ass
Off the wall, throw that girl
Against the wall, Retro-Physical

Off the walls, get your ass
Off the walls, move that boy
So sexual, Retro-Physical

Everyone is famous
Running round real aimlessly
We dance, we're the garage team
In between the spaces
Happiness can trace us down
We're not gonna leave this town
In between the spaces
Happiness can trace us down
We're not gonna leave this town

Off the wall, get your ass
Off the wall, throw that girl
Against the wall, Retro-Physical

Off the walls, get your ass
Off the walls, move that boy
So sexual, Retro-Physical
