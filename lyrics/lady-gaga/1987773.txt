There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it's right when it's so wrong
Tonight yeah baby, tonight yeah baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong tonight


I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

Another shot before we kiss the other side
Tonight yeah baby, tonight yeah baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight
Alright, alright

Put on your shades
'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
It isn't a hell if everybody knows my name tonight
Alright, alright

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you

Edge with you
Edge with you
Edge with you
Edge with you

I'm on the edge
I'm on the edge
I'm on the edge
I'm on the edge
