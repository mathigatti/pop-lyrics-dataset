I don't know why you hurt inside,
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see
You are the greatest thing to me and when
you feel like you're not enought.
I'll give you winds, i'll lift you up.
I hope that you can see
you are the Greatest thing to me.


I don't wanna waste another day,
I'm thinking of you,
Up, in the middle of day.
And I can see you waste another day.

Cause when I'm with you I-I fall apart,
I see your permantely broken heart.
Baby, you're the greatest to me,
No, no matter what, what, what.

I don't know why you hurt inside,
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see
You are the greatest thing to me and when
you feel like you're not enough.
I'll give you winds, i'll lift you up.
I hope that you can see
you are the Greatest thing to me.
