I can’t help myself
I’m addicted to a life of material
It’s some kind of joke
I’m obsessively opposed to the typical
All we care about is
Runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something I wanna be
Retro glamour, Hollywood yes
We live for the


Fame, (fame) doing it for the fame (fame)
’Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame, (fame) doing it for the fame (fame)
’Cause we gotta taste for champagne
And endless fortune

Fame fame baby, the fame fame fome
We live for the fame fame baby, the fame fame
Isn’t it a shame shame baby, a shame shame
In it for the fame fame baby, the fame fame

I can see myself
In the movies with my picture in city lights
Photograph my mind
And whatever else you’d like to shoot
You decide
All we care about
Is pornographic, girls on film and body plastic
Give me something I wanna see
Television and hot blondes in odd positions

Fame, (fame) doing it for the fame (fame)
’Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame, (fame) doing it for the fame (fame)
’Cause we gotta taste for champagne
And endless fortune

Fame fame baby, the fame fame
We live for the fame fame baby, the fame fame
Isn’t it a shame shame shame, a shame shame
In it for the fame fame baby, the fame fame

Don’t ask me how or why
But I’m gonna make it happen this time
My teenage dream tonight
Yeah, I’m gonna make it happen this time

Fame!

(Fame, doing it for the fame,
’Cause we wanna live the life of the)
Rich and famous
Fame, (fame) doing it for the fame (fame)
’Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame, (fame) doing it for the fame (fame)
’Cause we gotta taste for champagne
And endless fortune
Fame, (fame) doing it for the fame (fame)
’Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame, (fame) doing it for the fame (fame)
’Cause we gotta taste for champagne
And endless fortune

Fame!
