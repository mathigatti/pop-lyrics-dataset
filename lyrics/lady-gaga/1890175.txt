I never was the kind of girl that's naturally sure when it comes to love
Oh no
I was insecure
Insecure
But when it comes to you and me I can't deny
This feeling inside oh no
I never felt like this before
This before
No no no


Oh I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love
Oh yeah

I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
'Cause honey I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love

You know that I'd never cheat on a man
'Cause I'm not like that
I'm physically crafted to be
As fitting as McQueen

But when it comes to clothing I'm bad
I'm fashionably just designed to grand
Oh and he's no accessory to me
To me
No no no!

No I just can't seem to forget you
No I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my babe right through
I was made for you

Oh I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love
Oh yeah

I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
'Cause honey I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love

They say I need a strong man, not just a friend
But baby my search is done
No longer reason to cry or to justify
How I feel for you my love

Oh I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
Oh yeah

Oh I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love
Oh yeah

I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
'Cause honey I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love

I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
'Cause honey I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love
