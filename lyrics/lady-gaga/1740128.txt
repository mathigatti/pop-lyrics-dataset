You know your mine nears
my songs are written all, for you
I'm feeling so confused
i can't find a way to you
I need you almost in my life
to flashes 'em back to me
I caught you belong in my eyes
bleeding it easy, bleeding me


I need you email me love mail
we don't use no word no
when I need to hear your voice
Baby may your kisses chill me
send your flowers near to me, Love Mail

You're playing with me
not answering my calls, oh no
and gotten no replies on my messages to you, no more
I feel like to got crazy
thinking of you, all day
but something tells me you're still my life
i remain to find for your cards

I need you email me love mail
we don't use no word no
when i need to hear your voice
Baby may your kisses chill me
send your flowers near to me, Love Mail


You promise me now before leaving good
The moment you needed my warm love long lost
(oh yeah) I am a steady in your arms
thought that I could loose you one day
i run far away, so far from you i love..


I need you email me love mail
we don't use no word no
when i need to hear your voice
Baby may your kisses chill me
send your flowers near to me, Love Mail

I need you email me love mail
we don't use no word no
when I need to hear your voice
Baby may your kisses chill me
send your flowers near to me, Love Mail

I need you email me love mail
we don't use no word no
when I need to hear your voice (chill hear your voice)
Baby may your kisses chill me (chill me)
send your flowers near to me, Love Mail
