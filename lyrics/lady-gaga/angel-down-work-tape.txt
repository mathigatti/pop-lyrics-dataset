I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful


Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?

Shots were fired down the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
Why do people just stand around?

I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
