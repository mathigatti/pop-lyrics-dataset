Smile though your heart is breaking
Smile even though it's aching
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by


If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the Sun come shining through for you

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll see that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
