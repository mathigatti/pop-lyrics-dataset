I've had a little bit too much, much (oh, oh, oh-oh)
All of the people start to rush, start to rush by
A dizzy twister dance, can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone (oh, oh, oh-oh)

What's going on-on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright

Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Spin that record, babe
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just j-j-just dance

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth (oh, oh, oh-oh)
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? Inside out, right
Control your poison, babe, roses have thorns, they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight (oh, oh, oh-oh)

What's going on-on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright (woo!)

Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Spin that record, babe
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just j-j-just dance

When I come through on the dance floor checkin' out that catalogue (hey)
Can't believe my eyes, so many women without a flaw (hey)
And I ain't gonna give it up, steady tryna pick it up like a call (hey)
I'ma hit it up, beat it up, latch on to it until tomorrow, yeah

Shawty, I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirlin' up them hips round and round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime stay and let me watch you break it down and

[Lady Gaga &amp; (Akon)]
Dance, gonna be okay (oh-oh)

Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic
Got my blueprint, it's symphonic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic
Got my blueprint, electronic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic
Got my blueprint, it's symphonic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic
Got my blueprint, electronic

Go, use your muscle, carve it out, work it, hustle
(I got it, just stay close enough to get it on)
Don't slow, drive it, clean it, Lysol, bleed it
Spend the last dough (I got it)
In your pocko (I got it)

Just dance
Gonna be okay

Spin that record, babe
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Gonna be okay

Gonna be okay
