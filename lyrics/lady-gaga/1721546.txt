Making love in an ice cold room
We start 'til the candle burns - gone
Kissing each other 'til the moon says bye-bye
And the sun says hello


Lying here with no blanket
The room's temperature is sub-zero
Baby bring your body closer
'Cause you keep me warm when you're naked

Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Making out in this ice box 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Let's keep on, (keep) on freezin'
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)

Sweat drippin' up our bodies, breathin' small
While you're whispering to me
Ice crystal in this small, small bed
But we make frost when we're touching like that.

Laying here with no blanket
The room's temperature is sub-zero
Baby bring your body closer
'Cause you keep me warm when you're naked

Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Let's keep on, keep on freezin'
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)

Snowflakes at the tip of my fingers.
Frozen in time, our love lingers
Livin' in a world so cold,
Sometimes our hearts are just like icicles

Being with you is all I need
There's nothing we can't handle babe
Lay on my chest, please cover me
Deep frost, on this bed memories

Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Let's keep on, keep on freezin'
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)

Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Let's keep on, keep on freezin'
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)

Freezer Burn...
