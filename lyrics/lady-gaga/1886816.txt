I grew up in New York City
Since I was born on Broadway, baby
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen
To start a new life on the New York scene


There's no way I could be stopped
Was taking my best shot
I had a better plan
There's no way I could be stopped
Was coming for your spot
I met a better man

Amen
On the runway
Dressed in his best
Amen fashion
On the runway
Work it, Black Jesus

Amen
On the runway
Dressed in his best
Amen fashion
On the runway
Work it, Black Jesus

Dancing in my revelation
Underground pop civilization
Concrete poetry to feed my mind
Old symbolism was left behind

There's no way I could be stopped
Was taking my best shot
I had a better plan
There's no way I could be stopped
Was coming for your spot
I met a better man

Amen
On the runway
Dressed in his best
Amen fashion
On the runway
Work it, Black Jesus

Amen
On the runway
Dressed in his best
Amen fashion
On the runway
Work it, Black Jesus

Put it on amen fashion
Celebrate, oh, oh, a new compassion
Put it on amen fashion
Celebrate, oh, oh, style your passion

Put it on amen fashion
Celebrate, oh, oh, a new compassion
Put it on amen fashion
Celebrate, oh, oh, wear out your vision

Black Jesus, Black Jesus, Black Jesus
Jesus is the new black! Oh

Amen
On the runway
Dressed in his best
Amen fashion
On the runway
Work it, Black Jesus

Amen
On the runway
Dressed in his best
Amen fashion
On the runway
Work it, Black Jesus

Amen
On the runway
Dressed in his best
Amen fashion
On the runway
Work it, Black Jesus

On the runway
Dressed in his best
Amen fashion
On the runway
Work it, Black Jesus
