I'm calling cause I need you
You know I need you so desperately
You know how bad I can get
And you know, how good I can be


I'm calling just to tell you
Get here and I'll make it worth your while
I can make you some food
Boy, and then I can make you smile

'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
(Nothing) nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
With me tonight

You better get here soon
Or you know what I will do
Got too much time on my hands
Wait 'til I get my hands on you

'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
(Nothing) nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
With me tonight

When you get here, boy, we can dance
Our hands on the headboard, it's our defense
I've turned the lights down low
And I've got nothing on but the radio

Got too much time on my hands
Wait 'til I get my hands on you

'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
(Nothing) nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
With me tonight

Oh, oh, oh
I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
(Nothing) nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
With me tonight
