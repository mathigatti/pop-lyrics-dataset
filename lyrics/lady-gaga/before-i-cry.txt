I can’t believe the things you said
Right now I wish that you would try
Try to stay near me
Try to be near me
Before I cry
‘Cause I’m gonna need a well
To catch the pain and lift the spell
Like you won’t hear me
Can you try to heal me
Before I cry?


Hurry up, hurry up
Before I lose you
Hurry up, hurry up
Before you lose me too
Hurry up, hurry up
Before I change my mind

'Cause I’m gonna cry
If you say you don’t need me
I’m gonna cry if you act like you don’t care
Promise me, baby, you know I can’t fake it
Why don’t you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry

Could you please find another way?
I start to think I'm insane
Trying to stay here
Let me just lay here
Before I cry

Hurry up, hurry up
Before I lose you
Hurry up, hurry up
Before you lose me too
Hurry up, hurry up
Before I change my mind

'Cause I’m gonna cry
If you say you don’t need me
I’m gonna cry if you act like you don’t care
Promise me, baby, you know I can’t fake it
Why don’t you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry

I'm 'bout to lose it
It's that so confusing?
Am I just repeating myself?
Say something loving to me before I crumble
Tell me, tell me, tell me

'Cause I’m gonna cry
If you say you don’t need me
I’m gonna cry if you act like you don’t care
Promise me, baby, you know I can’t fake it
Why don’t you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry
Before I cry

Have I said what I needed to say?
Have you said what you wanted to say?
Did you say what you wanted to say?
Would you try and stop me before I cry?
