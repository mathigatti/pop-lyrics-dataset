I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream


So do what u want, what u want with my body
Do what u want, don't stop, let's party
Do what u want, what u want with my body
Do what u want, what u want with my body

Write what u want, say what u want about me
If you're wonderin' know that I'm not sorry
Do what u want, what u want with my body
What u want with my body

U can't have my heart and u won't use my mind but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body
U can't stop my voice cause u don't own my life but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body

My bones hurt from all the shows
But I don't feel the pain 'cause I'm a pro
I, I sink in and then I'm okay
'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage

So do what u want, what u want with my body
Do what u want, don't stop, let's party
Do what u want, what u want with my body
Do what u want, what u want with my body

Write what u want, say what u want about me
If you're wonderin' know that I'm not sorry
Do what u want, what u want with my body
What u want with my body

U can't have my heart and u won't use my mind but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body
U can't stop my voice cause u don't own my life but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body

Sometimes I'm scared I suppose if you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body and don't stop the party

U can't have my heart and u won't use my mind but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body
U can't stop my voice cause u don't own my life but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body

Do what u want with me, what u want, Lady Gaga
What u want with me, Christina, what u want with my body
Do what u want with me, what u want with my body
Do what u want with me, what u want with my body, world
