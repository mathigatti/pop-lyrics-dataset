Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around


Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Hot shit, in Brooklyn
Painted green watermelon
That guy's ride is good lookin', good lookin'
He tells me that he loves me
And even though I'm real sexy
He loves his car, car, car
He's always with his car, car, car

So, I rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around

Start it, pump it, wash it, bump it
Rub that glitter and grease, he loves it
Me so grimy, make her shiny
There's more glitter and grease behind it

New York on the weekend
Ain’t nothing without your woman
That guy’s girl is good lookin', good lookin'
He’d buy me presents, baby
But gas costs him a lot of money
He loves his car, car, car
He spends it on his car, car, car

So, I rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around

Start it, pump it, wash it, bump it
Rub that glitter and grease, he loves it
Me so grimy, make her shiny
There's more glitter and grease behind it

Start it, pump it, wash it, bump it
Rub that glitter and grease, he loves it
Me so grimy, make her shiny
There's more glitter and grease behind it

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around
