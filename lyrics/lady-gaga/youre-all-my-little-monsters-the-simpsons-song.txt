When they're young
All little monsters learn
That they are scary


Ugly, stupid
Shunned by cupid
Overweight, and hairy

But every monster needs to find
That secret deep inside
That transforms Dr. Jekyll into sexy Mr. Hyde!

All my monsters are beautiful!

Discostoodiful
Squarerootiful
Oldcootiful

Monsters don't need implants
Or a bitchin' monster car
Monsters only need to love
The monsters that they are

Oh, yeah!
Gaga, Dada, Jawa
Peace!
