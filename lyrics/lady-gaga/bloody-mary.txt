Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone I'll tell them my religion's you
When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones


I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head like
Jesus said

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, dance together
Forgive him before he's dead

Because I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you
See, when you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary

(Love, love, love, love)

(Dance, dance, dance)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

We are not
Just art for Michaelangelo to carve
He can't, rewrite the agro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris cold
Je ne veux pas mourir toute seule

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head like
Jesus said

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, dance together
Forgive him before he's dead

Because I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
Because I won't cry for you
See, when you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary

(Love, love, love, love)

(Dance, dance, dance)

Bloody, bloody, bloody
