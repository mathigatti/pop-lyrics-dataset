Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine
I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside banging but I won't let you in
Cuz it's a hard life, with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl
Lovin' me is like chewing on pearls


You got me wondering why I-
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I-
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough

Won't go without my fix tonight
It's a little too rough
Prom Girl wipes her tears with silver lines
And she can't get enough

I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside banging but I won't let you in
Cuz it's a hard life, with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl
Lovin' me is like straightening curls

You got me wondering why I-
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I-
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough
(baby likes it a-rough)
I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough
(baby likes it a-rough)
(repeat)

Is it cuz you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it?
Unless it's rough
Is it cuz you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it?
Unless it's rough

You got me wondering why I-
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I-
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I-
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I-
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
