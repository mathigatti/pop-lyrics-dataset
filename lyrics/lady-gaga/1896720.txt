I was walking along, minding my business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash, bam, alacazam, wonderful, you came by
.
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
Wham, bam, alacazam, I got a look at you
.
One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit, This is it, this is it
.
I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alacazam
Out of the orange colored sky


.
Well, one look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit, this is it, this is it
.
I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alacazam
Out of the orange colored, purple stripes
Pretty green polka-dot sky
Flash, bam, alacazam
Went the sky
