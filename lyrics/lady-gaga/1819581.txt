You have got a wild side
You're an animal tonight
I see that you are my type
Wild like a tiger, hunting the prey we'll keep
The neighbors up all night
Hot in the jungle
Exotic apparel


I can see the way that you're lookin at me
Like you're hungry and I am the only thing that you see
Won't tame you love the way
Your watching me (watching me)

Baby, I'mma keep you up all night
Gonna tie you up incase you bite
Animal, animal
My animal, animal

Baby, imma lock you in my cage
And I wont stop until you behave
Animal, animal
My animal, animal

Baby, I'mma gonna keep you up all night
Like an animal, animal
My animal, animal

I'm gonna tie you up incase you bite
You're an animal, animal
My animal, animal

I don't need to blame you
I'm just trying to tame you
You're an aniaml, animal
Animal, animal

I don't need to blame you
I'm just trying to tame you
You're an anmial, animal
Animal, animal

Oh
You're a hunter, I feel your way
I'll do what ever you say
Hold me down and take control
Messing my hair all, crazy sex-ual
Do it like an animal
Hot in the jungle
Exotic apparel

I can see the way that you're lookin at me
Like your hungry and I am the only thing that you see
Won't tame you, love the way
