I'm not bad, I just sound that way

All the girls, they like their presents, like their presents
When boys wrap 'em up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
Doesn't matter if they're precious or expensive
If they're well thought out, sexed up, wrapped right
Every time, get in line and give me mine


We like black, white, big striped
Polka-dotted, cafe latte
Presents come in many sizes
Wrap them up in ribbons

Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons

Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons

I'm not a Hallmark card expression
Need material attention wrapped in ribbons
Richard Simmons; silly ribbons, ribbons, ribbons

If you can't afford the best
Don't be stressed, take a rest
Get a job, do it right
It's my birthday all night

We like black, white, big striped
Famous, super-sizing fries
We don't care what you put inside it
Wrap it up in ribbons

It's the life style that I like
I'll give you yours, you'll give me mine
But don't forget to wrap them up
In pretty, pretty ribbons

Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons

Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons

Only difference between downtown and uptown
Is therapy and valium, therapy and valium
Not lying when I say this, there's a price to being famous
Yeah, it's therapy and valium, therapy and valium

It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up, everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up, everybody wrap it up

(Lots of presents)
It's not complicated
(Filthy riches)
Just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up, everybody wrap it up
(Got good presents)
It's not complicated
(Filthy riches)
Just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up, everybody wrap it up

Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons

Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons
Wrap their presents up in ribbons

Wrap their presents up
Wrap their presents up
