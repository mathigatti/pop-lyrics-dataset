We love each other so deeply
That I ask you this, sweetheart
Why should we quarrel ever
Why can't we be enough clever
Never to part


Every time we say goodbye
I die a little
Every time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

When you're near
There's such an air
Of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it

Theres no love song finer
But how strange the change
From major to minor
Every time we say goodbye
Every time we say goodbye
