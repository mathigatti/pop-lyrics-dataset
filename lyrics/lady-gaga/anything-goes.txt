In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now, heaven knows, anything goes


Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words writing prose
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good’s bad today
And day’s night today
And black’s white today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

And, though I’m not a great romancer
I know that you’re bound to answer
When we propose, anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good’s bad today
And day’s night today
And black’s white today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

And, though I’m not a great romancer
I know that you’re bound to answer
When we propose, anything goes

Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
