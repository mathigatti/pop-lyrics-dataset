I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream


So do what u want, what u want with my body
Do what u want, don't stop, let's party
Do what u want, what u want with my body
Do what u want, what u want with my body

Write what u want, say what u want about me
If you're wonderin' know that I'm not sorry
Do what u want, what u want with my body
What u want with my body

U can't have my heart and u won't use my mind, but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body
U can't stop my voice, 'cause u don't own my life but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body

Early morning, longer nights
Tom Ford, private flights
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, 'cuz it's our life

(Let's slow it down)

I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusher man
Yea, I got what you want

You wanna escape
All of the crazy shit
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president
I love to hear you say, girl

Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Back of the club takin’ shots gettin’ naughty
No invitations it's a private party

Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Yea, we takin’ these haters and we roughin’ ‘em up
And we layin’ the club like we don't give a fuck

U can't have my heart and u won't use my mind, but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body
U can't stop my voice, 'cause u don't own my life, but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body

Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose if you ever let me go
I would fall apart, if you break my heart
So just take my body and don't stop the party

U can't have my heart and u won't use my mind, but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body
U can't stop my voice 'cause u don't own my life, but
Do what u want with my body, do what u want with my body

Do what u want with me, what u want with my body
Do what u want with me, ARTPOP, with my body
Do what u want with me, what u want with my body
Do what u want with me, what u want with my body, world
