What if I were to leave you
But then you fell back in love with me?


How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever-ever let me, go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young
Guitar, guitar

No, I just can't seem to forget you
Not ever just as long as I left you
You're my baby, you
Never made it through, to you

If I were the last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet, there was an Earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet, and there was an Earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever-ever let me, go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young
Guitar, guitar

No, I just can't seem to forget you
Not ever just as long as I left you
You're my baby, you
Never made it through, to you

If I were the last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet, there was an Earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet, and there was an Earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

If I were the last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet, there was an Earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet, and there was an Earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, maybe then you'd love me
