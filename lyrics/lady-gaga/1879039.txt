Money, money, money, money
Oh-oh-woah-oh


Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone I'll tell them my religion's you
When pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

I'll dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head head head
Like Jesus said

I'm gonna dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands above my head
Hands together forgive him before he's dead because

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you see
When you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary

We are not just art for michelangelo
To carve he can't rewrite the agro
Of my furied heart I'll wait
On mountain tops in paris cold
Je ne veux pas mourir tout seule

I'll dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head head head
Like Jesus said

I'm gonna dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands above my head
Hands together forgive him before he's dead because

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you see
When you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary

(Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga)

Dum dum da di da
Dum dum da di da
Dittie da di da

Dum dum da di da
Dum dum da di da
Dittie da di da
Dum dum da di da

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you see
When you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary
