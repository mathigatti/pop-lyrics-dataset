I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream awhile, scheme awhile, you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for


Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, Tony
With diamond watches Tiffany's just won't sell, baby
'Till that lucky day, you know darn well
I can't give you anything but love

I can't give you anything but love, lady
That's the only thing I've plenty of, lady
Dream awhile, scheme awhile, you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess
All the things you've always pined for

I'd like to see me looking swell, lady
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, Gaga
'Till that lucky day, you know darn well, baby
I can't give you anything
I don't want just anything
I can't give you anything but love
