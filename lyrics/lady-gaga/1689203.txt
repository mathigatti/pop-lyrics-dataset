(Intro)
Family tree, love, love your roots
Family tree


If you love your mother please tell her that you love her
And don't forget to tell your brother and don't miss your sis
Amidst all this family bliss
And give your mom a big hug and a kiss
Kind words go a long way, write a song today
And you might stop someone from going the wrong way
Don't delay, it's my advice think twice and be nice
You just might save a life
Just one life, is just like saving the world
It's more than wealth, it's just like saving yourself
The family tree, love your roots
And if we all follow suit, then we can begin to bear fruit

(Chorus)
We're gonna make a pact and stop at the roots and take it back
We all need a family. Oh
Family tree, love, love your roots
Family tree

It takes a village to raise a child
It might take the whole world just to save a child
And one of the children just might save the world
So we need every boy and girl
And we all need to walk in the same path stride for stride
With hearts and arms open wide
With the same kind of mind
With a true love divine
And never let the blind lead the blind

And never have no fear be a voice for the deaf to hear
Spread the word so the voiceless ones can be heard
Build a road where even the lame can roam free
For you and me
A new world family tree

(Chorus)
We're gonna make a pact and stop at the roots and take it back
We all need a family. Oh
Family tree, love, love your roots
Family tree

Sisters and brothers may attack you
But stop to think, why do what they do
Just think first, never burst
Or you'll find out, that you're only making things worse
(Repeat 3x)

(Chorus)
We're gonna make a pact and stop at the roots and take it back
We all need a family. Oh
Family tree, love, love your roots
Family tree

Brothers and sisters fill your life with happiness and harmony
And just follow me and the whole world will be your family tree
Peace
