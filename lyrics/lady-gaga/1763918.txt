[Elton John]:
I feel I'm feeling light
And I'm up to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?


[Lady Gaga]:
Ducking up and down
All those crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool

[Elton John]:
Just when you think
Your chain is just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool

[Both]:
Hello hello
Hello hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

[Lady Gaga]:
Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know

[Elton John]:
Someone dropped right in to say hello

[Both]:
Hello!

[Elton John]:
Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy
Nothing comes for free

[Lady Gaga]:
Sniffing on a flower
Run through an autumn shower

[Both]:
I'm better off with someone else like me

Hello hello
Hello hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

[Lady Gaga]:
Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know

[Elton John]:
Someone dropped right in to say hello

[Both]:
Hello hello
Hello hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

[Lady Gaga]:
Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know

[Elton John]:
Someone dropped right in to say hello

[Both]:
Hello Hello
Hello hello

[Elton John]:
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

[Lady Gaga]:
Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know

[Elton John]:
Someone dropped right in to say hello

[Both]:
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
