Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa

Whenever I'm dressed cool
My parents put up a fight
(Uh huh, uh huh)
And if I'm hotshot
Mom will cut my hair at night
(Uh huh, uh huh)


And in the morning
I'm sure of my identity
(Uh huh, uh huh)
I scream mom and dad
Why can't I be who I wanna be?
(Uh huh, uh huh)
To be

I just wanna be myself
And I want yo端 to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself
And I want yo端 to know, I am my hair

I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on the streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm a free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair

Free as my hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair
Free as my hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair

Sometimes I some raccoons
Or red highlights
(Uh huh, uh huh)
Just because I want my friends
To think I'm dynamite
(Uh huh, uh huh)

And on friday rock city
High school dance
(Uh huh, uh huh)
I got my bangs to hide
That I don't stand a chance
(Uh huh, uh huh)
A chance

I just wanna be myself
And I want yo端 to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself
And I want yo端 to know, I am my hair

I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair

And I want lots of friends
That invite me to their parties
Don't wanna change
And I don't wanna be ashamed
