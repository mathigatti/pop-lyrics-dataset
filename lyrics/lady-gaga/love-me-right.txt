Would you love me right?
My life is a story
Do you wanna know the truth?
I'm tall in high heels
But I am only five foot two
What you see ain't always
What you gonna get, it's true
You see the best in me
Even when I have no clue


I don't wanna feel this way no more
I don't wanna feel this weight
I'm sick of hiding from myself
I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna run far from my home
I don't wanna lose my way
I don't wanna be my friend no more
I don't wanna play this game

Would you still love me if 
I gave it all up just to cry?
Would you still love me?
Would, would you still love me right?
Would you still need me if 
I didn't t-tell you goodbye?
Would you still love me?
Would, would you still love me right?

Take my picture from me
And imagine what I'd do
I know what's best for me
Try to do what's best for you
This could all be fiction
I know that it sounds taboo
I wear my heart on my sleeve
It's making its debut

I don't wanna feel this way no more
I don't wanna feel this weight
I'm sick of hiding from myself
I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna run far from my home
I don't wanna lose my way
I don't wanna be my friend no more
I don't wanna play this game

Would you still love me if 
I gave it all up just to cry?
Would you still love me?
Would, would you still love me right?
Would you still need me if 
I didn't tell you goodbye?
Would you still love me?
Would, would you still love me right?

Would you still love me right?
Would you still love me right?
Would you still love me right?
Would you still love me right?
