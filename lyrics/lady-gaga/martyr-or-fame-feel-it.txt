What is wrong
When I know
We got a feeling
Daddy song
Is gong in my mind (all night)
I feel like we are loosing control
And we're singin even more
And I wanna know
And I wanna know
And I wanna know


What you feel?

What you feel? Its right!
Let's not waste our time
We were burned 'till the night
In the flames of fire
We both know we can't denny it

What is wrong
When I know
We can't escape
The beat goes on and on
And never ends
There's nothing we can do
We, ve got ours bodys in the groove

What is wrong
When I know
When just get stuck
It's dangerous, it's so close
I attack
This music drives me
Wild
I guess I'm lossing my mind
All I wanna know

What is wrong
When I know
We got a feeling

What is wrong
When I know
We got a feeling

What you feel? Its right!
Let's not waste our time
We were burned 'till the night
In the flames of fire
We both know we can't denny it
We are filled with desire
Now I play 'till tomorrow

You'll see control

What you feel? Its right!
Well let's not waste our time
We were burned tonight
In the flames of fire

What you feel? Its right!
Let's not waste our time
We were burned 'till the night
In the flames of fire
We both know we can't denny it
We are filled with desire
Now I play 'till tomorrow

What you feel?

What you feel?
What you feel?
What you?
