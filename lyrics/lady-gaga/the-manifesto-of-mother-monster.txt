This is The Manifesto of Mother Monster
On G.O.A. t, a Government Owned Alien Territory in space
A birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place
But the birth was not finite, it was infinite
As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began
It was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal
And thus began the beginning of the new race
A race within the race of humanity
A race which bears no prejudice, no judgment
But boundless freedom
But on that same day, as the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse
Another more terrifying birth took place
The birth of evil
And as she herself split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces
The pendulum of choice began its dance
It seems easy, you imagine
To gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good
But she wondered
How can I protect something so perfect without evil?
