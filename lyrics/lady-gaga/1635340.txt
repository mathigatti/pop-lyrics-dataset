(You know what I like)
(Know-Know I-I)


Do it
(Do it, do it)

Feel like getting dirty now
One, two, three, my pants are down
Not gonna reason, you're gonna do, whatever I like
'Cause I'm happy as a clam tonight

I want everything, baby
Everything, baby
You know what I like
(You know what I like)

I need everything, baby
Everything, baby
And you're doing me right

When you're out with all your friends
And you got money to spend
Do me right-right
Do me right-right
Do me right (do it, do it)

I don't wanna
In the club, or in the corner
Do me right-right
Do me right-right
Do me right (do it, do it)

Lick me, slap me, do it, do it
Do me right, there's nothing to it

It's 'bout time you ice my cake
Wants someone who milks my shake
Want to arrest me? Don't interest me, with your talk
Hapiness is a loaded gun

I want everything, baby
Everything, baby
You know what I like
(You know what I like)

I need everything, baby
Everything, baby
And you're doing me right

When you're out with all your friends
And you got money to spend
Do me right-right
Do me right-right
Do me right (do it, do it)

I don't wanna
In the club, or in the corner
Do me right-right
Do me right-right
Do me right (do it, do it)

When you're out with all your friends
And you got money to spend
Do me right-right
Do me right-right
Do me right (do it, do it)

I don't wanna
In the club, or in the corner
Do me right-right
Do me right-right
Do me right (do it, do it)

Lick me, slap me, do it, do it
Do me right, there's nothing to it

Lick me, slap me, do it, do it
Do me right, there's nothing to it

I want you in my bed, alright?
Can't sleep without my fix tonight

It's not polite or lady like
Can't sleep without my fix tonight

Do it right, do it right, do it right
Do me right. Do me right

(Right)

When you're out with all your friends
And you got money to spend
Do me right-right
Do me right-right
Do me right (do it, do it)

I don't wanna
In the club, or in the corner
Do me right-right
Do me right-right
Do me right (do it, do it)

When you're out with all your friends
And you got money to spend
Do me right-right
Do me right-right
Do me right (do it, do it)

I don't wanna
In the club, or in the corner
Do me right-right
Do me right-right
Do me right (do it, do it)

Lick me, slap me, do it, do it
Do me right, there's nothing to it

Lick me, slap me, do it, do it
Do me right, there's nothing to it
