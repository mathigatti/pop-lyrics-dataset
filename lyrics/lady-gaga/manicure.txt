Put some lipstick on
Perfume your neck and slip your high heels on
Rinse and curl your hair
Loosen your hips and get a dress to wear
I'm the one who's
Been comin' 'round lookin' lovin' you
You're the medicine
I need to heal the way you make me feel


I'm gon' be manicured
You wanna be man cured
Ma, ma, ma, manicure
She wanna be man cured
Salon's enough for her
Not to feel so insecure
Ma, ma, ma, manicure
She wanna be take care'n of (man cured)
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?
I'm addicted to the love that you garner (man cured)
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Like a serial killer, man is a goner (man cured)

Touch me in the dark
Put your hands all over my body parts
Throw me on the bed
Squeeze, tease me, please me, that's what I said
'Cause I'm the, trick who's
Been comin' 'round lookin' lovin' you
You're the, the medicine
I need to heal the way, the way, the way you make me feel

I'm gon' be manicured
You wanna be man cured
Ma ma ma manicured
She wanna be man cured (man cured)
Salon's enough for her

I'm addicted to the love that you garner (man cured)
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it

Man cure!

Heal me, cause I'm addicted to love
Save me, cause I'm addicted to love
