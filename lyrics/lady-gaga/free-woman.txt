(I'll remember that, I'll remember that)
(I'll remember that, that I)
(I'll remember that, I'll remember that)
(I'll remember that, that I)


I walk the downtown, hear my sound
No one knows me yet, not right now
But I am bound to set this feeling in motion
I walk the downtown, hear my sound

I say that I want it, want it (be free)
Don't fight it, fight it
But if I'm gonna go for it
I'll remember that, that
I say that I want it, want it (be free)
Don't fight it, fight it
But if I'm gonna go for it
I'll remember that, that I

I'm not nothing without a steady hand
I'm not nothing unless I know I can
I'm still something if I don't got a man
I'm a free woman, oh-oh (be free)

Oh, yeah
(Be free)

This is my dancefloor I fought for
A heart, that's what I'm livin' for
So light up my body and kiss me too hardly
We own the downtown, hear our sound

I say that I want it, want it (be free)
Don't fight it, fight it
But if I'm gonna go for it
I'll remember that, that
I say that I want it, want it (be free)
Don't fight it, fight it
But if I'm gonna go for it
I'll remember that, that I

I'm not nothing without a steady hand (I'm a free woman)
I'm not nothing unless I know I can (I'm a free woman)
I'm still something if I don't got a man
I'm a free woman, oh-oh (be free; c'mon, woo)

I'm a free woman
I'm a free woman (be free)
I'm a free woman
I'm a free woman, oh-oh (be free)
Oh, yeah (I'm a free woman)

I'm not nothing without a steady hand (I'm a free woman)
I'm not nothing unless I know I can (I'm a free woman)
I'm still something if I don't got a man
I'm a free woman (oh), oh-oh (be free)
