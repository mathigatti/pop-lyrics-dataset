I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,
Just like the ones I used to know.
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen,
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.


I'm dreaming of a white white Christmas,
With every Christmas card I write.

Oh, may your days be so merry merry and bright,
And may all your Christmases be white.

So, as you can tell I'm very outgoing.
And a little bit shy,
But I've decided that this song is just too short.
It's such a beautiful Christmas song,
But it's only one verse,
So I added one extra one.
Here it goes.

I'm dreaming of a white snowman,
With a carrot nose and charcoal eyes.
Oh, and when he cries, I'm gonna tell him,
It's okay, because Santa's on his sleigh,
And he's on his way.

Oh, oh, oh, I, I'm dreaming, oh, oh, white Christmas,
With every Christmas card I write.
Oh, may all your days and your Thanksgivings be so right.
And may all, all your Christmases be white.
