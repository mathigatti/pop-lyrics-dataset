All my life, and the hereafter
(I've never seen one like that before)
I've never seen someone like you


You're a knife, (you're a monster)
Sharp and deadly, (don't call me Gaga)
And its me, that you cut into (you amaze me)

But I don't mind, in fact I like it, (don't look at me like that)
Though I'm terrified, I'm turned on but scared of you

She's a monster, she's a monster
That boy is a monster, that boy is a monster
Beautiful monster, beautiful monster
That boy is a monster, that boy is a monster

No, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
No, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
No, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)

Ohh

(He ate my heart)
No, I don't mind

He licked his lips
Said to me
Girl you look good enough to eat
Put his arms around me
Said: Boy now get your paws right off me

But I don't mind
In fact I like it
Though I'm terrified
I'm turned on but scared of you

She's a monster, she's a monster
That boy is a monster, that boy is a monster
Beautiful monster, beautiful monster
That boy is a monster, that boy is a monster

Playin with my heart
And she's playin with my mind

And I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
No I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
No I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
No I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)

Ohh

No I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
No I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
No I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
No I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)

Beautiful monster

She's a monster, she's a monster
That boy is a monster, that boy is a monster
Beautiful monster, beautiful monster
That boy is a monster, that boy is a monster

No I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
No I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
No I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)
No I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind, (he ate my heart)

No I don't mind
