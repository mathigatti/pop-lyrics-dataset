Where did they go?
Where did everybody go?
I wanna know


We could've tried.
Why did everybody cry,
If you weren't mine?

Now, everything is gonna change
You've made your mind up. well, my friend,
You've got a lot to learn, ya do.
Why do we deny ourselves?
In terms of love,
I'm at a loss. Oh well.
Oh Well, oh Well
Oh Well, Oh Well

Can't find the words
But hey, man, everbody hurts
When it doesn't work

Now, everything is gonna change
You've made your mind up. well, my friend,
You've got a lot to learn, ya do.
Why do we deny ourselves?
In terms of love,
I'm at a loss. Oh well.
Oh Well, oh Well
Oh Well, Oh Well

Your love drowned us in a hole.
You never ever wanted her to grow.
To grow. Oh, Oh,
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

If everything is gonna change
Was it worth it? Oh, my friend,
You've got a lot to learn, ya do.
Why do we deny ourselves?
In terms of love,
you weren't strong enough (Oh Well) for me..

Oh Well, oh Well
Oh Well, Oh Well

Oh Well
