And I always think of you, oh,
I text you pictures! (pic, pic)
All the time I'm on my phone.


Baby you know (know), you left a mark (mark).
Do you remember when we taped it in the dark (dark)?
I talk for free (free), and honestly (ly).
Do you remember when we taped it in the dark (dark)?
Sometimes I see (see), you’re wanting me (me),
But baby I don’t care, I’ll text you one for free (free).
