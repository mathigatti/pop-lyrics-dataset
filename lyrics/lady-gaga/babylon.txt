We only have the weekend
You can serve it to me, ancient-city style
We can party like it's B.C.
With a pretty sixteenth-century smile


It's the thing that you bring
That you bring, that you bring
Him, you and me
That's gossip

Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon

Ba-Ba-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon (battle for your life)
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon

Body's moving like a sculpture (ooh)
On the top of Tower of Babel tonight
We are climbing up to Heaven (heaven)
Speaking languages in a BloodPop moonlight

It's the thing that you bring
That you bring, that you bring
Him, you, and me
That's gossip (That's gossip)

Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon

Ba-Ba-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon (battle for your life)
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon
Battle for your life, Babylon

Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon

Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
