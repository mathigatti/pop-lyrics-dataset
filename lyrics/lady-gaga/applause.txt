I stand here waiting for
You to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying
Is it right or is it wrong?


If only fame had an I.V.
Baby, could I bear
Being away from you, I
Found the vein, put it in here

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love
(I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love
(I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)

A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
(Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
(Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch

I've overheard your theory
Nostalgia's for geeks
I guess, sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read

One second I'm a Koons then
Suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art
Now art's in pop culture, in me!

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love
(I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love
(I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)

A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
(Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
(Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch

Touch, touch
Touch, touch now

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love
(I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love
(I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)

A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
(Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
(Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-R-T-P-O-P
