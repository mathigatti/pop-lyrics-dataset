Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter Wonderland


Gone away is the Bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter Wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?"
We'll say, "No, man
But you can do the job when you're in town"

Later on, we'll conspire
As we drink by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter Wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter Wonderland

Tony, it's snowing!
Merry Christmas!
