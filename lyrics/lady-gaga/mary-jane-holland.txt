Lady of the ‘dam
Won't be a slave to the blonde
Or the culture of the popular
She won't, she won't!
Sing at you I'll
Fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil in sight
I will, I will!


‘Cuz I love, love
‘Cuz I love, love
You better than
You better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers
And cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary Jane Holland
Whoooh-Whooo

Mary Jane Holland
Whoooh-Whooo

I don't like to boast
But our truffles are the most
Mad magical in Amsterdam
She won't, she won't!
So if you have fear
Apollo sit on my lyre and
Play him like a piano man
I will, I will!

‘Cuz I love, love
‘Cuz I love, love
You better than
You better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers
And cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary Jane Holland
Whooh-Whoo

Mary Jane Holland
Whooh-Whoo

I know that mom and dad think I'm a mess
But it's alright because I am rich as piss
When I ignite the flame and put you in my mouth
The grass eats up my insides and my brunette starts to sprout

Introducing, ladies and gentlemen, Mary Jane Holland!

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary Jane Holland
Whooh-Whoo
