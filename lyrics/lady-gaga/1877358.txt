I-i-i have these visions.
I'm just a glamorous woman.
I believe in the glamorous life style.
The whole world might not understand.
I don't really care, i-i-i don't really care.
I-i-i'm just a magical angel, in heaven!
It's true.
I have these psychotic/iconic visions everyday.
I came up with this idea that I called "Kermit"
&amp; i think you gotta make make my (BEEP) blow up.
You gotta make make my (BEEP) blow up.
I'm just a glamorous woman.
I believe in the glamorous lifestyle.
I'm just a magical angel!
I, believe in the magical lifestyle.
It's true.
