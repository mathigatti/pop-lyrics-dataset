We could have been perfect
We could have been perfect


We could of been perfect
If you let it
But you let it, let it go
We could of been perfect
If you let it
But you let it, let it go
Could of been happy and still alive
Now Im going through hell in his single life
We could of been perfect
If you let it
Now this is klling us

I need you, but I don't need you
I just need you to go, I want you, but I don't want too
I just wanna let it go

I know it's easier said then done
I keep pretending that I've moved on
And after all these lies,
I keep telling myself
Help me from falling,
I'm broken, not perfect and it hurts

We could of been perfect
If you let it
But you let it, let it go
We could of been perfect
If you let it
But you let it, let it go
Could of been happy and still alive
Now Im going through hell in his single life
We could of been perfect
If you let it
Now this is klling us

I tried to forget you
Don't wanna forget you
So I keep forgetting too improfections,
Why do you let them hurt you?
You know they were hurting me too

I know it's easier said then done
I keep pretending that I've moved on
And after all these lies,
I keep telling myself
Help me from falling,
I'm broken, not perfect and it hurts

We could of been perfect
If you let it
But you let it, let it go
We could of been perfect
If you let it
But you let it, let it go
Could of been happy and still alive
Now Im going through hell in his single life
We could of been perfect
If you let it
Now this is klling us

Day by day, I would run away
The clock ticks, but doesn't change
Are we living?
Or just existing?
Afraid to face our fears

We could of been perfect
If you let it
But you let it, let it go
We could of been perfect
If you let it
But you let it, let it go
Could of been happy and still alive
Now Im going through hell in his single life
We could of been perfect
If you let it
Now this is klling us.
