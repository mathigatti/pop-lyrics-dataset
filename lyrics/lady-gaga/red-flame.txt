Uh
You know, ah
Ha
Let's go


Patent leather
6 inch, high heel
Ostrich, platform
Mary Jane, thirty-seven, red flame (yes girls, pump it)
Now walk, now walk, now walk
I wanna see you pump it
Now walk, now walk, now walk
Ha don't be mad cause they always said you'd free-fall
I wanna see you pump it

Pump it bitch to the haters a verse
6 inch, lizard skin, alligator, the purse
Shoot gang six, six, and steipers and berks
I like it, I perch
Vixon and viper the first
Viper the first
You like two and a third
Like who is this bird
Like who in the fur
You heard it a her
Little heffa in the flat 10 dollar skirt
Bitch, never spit the stack on the frock of the purse
The buzz of the block, why nah-nah be the word
The stock of the hills
Fifth fire flavor for real
When I vamp down the catwalk, I pump it for real
Liquorice lipstick, candy coated, the deal

Patent leather
6 inch high heel
Ostrich, platform
Mary Jane, thirty-seven, red flame (yes girls, pump it)
Now walk, now walk, now walk
I wanna see you pump it
Now walk, now walk, now walk
Ha don't be mad cause they always said you'd free-fall
I wanna see you pump it

Pump this, promote this
I know you notice this heel
Notice these high boots plus the focus could kill
Beauty Bambi, young, determined and willed
No previews baby, it's only premieres

I don't, I don't kn-know what you want
But I know, kn-know that you don't want
None, no you don't want none of me
No, not today
Not today, boy don't misbehave
Ok, ok

Cause it's little A-B, Lady G-A G-A
Tell your little DJ better hit that replay
Listen up my nigga when I'm sipping Clicquot
Lemme hit that we-hay, lemme feel that freak-ay
Finna pop a pill and get that feeling she chased
When I dip and pli√©
Gimme-gimme leeway
Bitches on my rhythm and they hear me he say
He remember me-ay
He remember me-member me

Patent leather

Now walk, now walk, now walk
I wanna see you pump it
Now walk, now walk, now walk
Ha don't be mad cause they always said you'd free-fall
