Ground control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Check ignition, and may God's love be with you
This is ground control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare


Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strain
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band

Oh, don't lean on me man 'cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me man 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know, my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Ah, wham bam, thank you, ma'am
My Suffragette City

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy, or a girl
Rebel, rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel, rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel, rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so

There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name
Oh, fashion
That people from bad homes do again and again
Oh, fashion
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Oh, fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town

Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame

Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's sway
To the song they're playin' on the radio
If you say run, I'll run with you
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

I, I could be king
And you, you can be my queen
Though nothing, could drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
