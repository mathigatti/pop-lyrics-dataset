I've got no friends
I'm my own queen
But I'm living on, living on the the radio
That's my dream


Stone river eyes
And a lonely heart
If I'm living on the radio
They won't tear me apart

10 steps and roses on the tree
10 steps and lonely nights
But you've still got me
On the road
Road paved in gold

Baby you must believe
Baby you must be free
Keep living on, living on the radio
That's my dream

Baby you've gotta friend
And so many little monsters, yeah
Keep living on, living on the radio
That's your dream

And when there's nowhere to go
And your friends are gone
And you only got your daddy to call
It will be all right, honey
'Cause your songs are on the radio

'Cause the showbiz, all the caviar
The champagne and the sold out shows
But it will be all right honey
'Cause your songs are on the radio
