I wanna be your G.U.Y, yeah
I wanna be the grave and earth you (oh, yeah)
Our sexes tell us no lies

I'm gonna wear the tie, want the power to leave you
I'm aiming for full control of this love (of this love)
Touch me, touch me, don't be sweet
Love me, love me, please retweet

I don’t need to be on top
To know I'm worth it
'Cause I'm strong enough to know the truth
I just want it to be hot
Because I’m best when I’m in love
And I’m in love with you

Touch me, touch me
(Mount your goddess)
Touch me, touch me
(A summer moon comes into full phase)
Get on top of me
(And Mars warring spirit rams into the atmosphere)

Touch me, touch me, don’t be shy

I lay down face up this time
Under you like a G.U.Y.

I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
The girl under you (GUY)

I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
I’ll wreck you right up, guy (G.U.Y.)
I’ll lie down face up, guy (G.U.Y.)
The girl under you (GUY)
