There's no exame with Jean-Paul Sartre
Hope you don't think my obsession is awkward

Princess High Die

There's no particular thing that I want
There's no particular drug that I love
But when I can't find my stache I give up
I need to deal with myself and get messed up

Where's my stache?
Can you feed my love
Cannabis
Can you feed my love?

Where's my stache?
Where's my stache?
Cannabis?
High Princess
Where's my stache?

And turn, turn it up

Let's party, let's get messed up
Let's get messed up
Let's get messed up
You're so messed up
