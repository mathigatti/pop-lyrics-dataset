I am so fab
Check out, I’m blonde
I’m skinny
I’m rich
And I’m a little bit of a bitch


I wanna dress you up in silk taffeta
Tailor these clothes to fit your guilt
What’s your size?
This purse can hold my black card and tiara
Versace promises I will
Dolce vita

What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

Donatella
(I’m smoking ’em on full tank of gas)
Mi-mi-bella
(I’m a rich bitch, I’m the upper class)
All of the day
(I’m the pearl to your oyster, I’m a babe)
I’m gonna smoke marlboro lights and drink champagne
(I smoke marlboro reds and drink champagne)

Donatella
’Cause she walks so bad like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows, she’s misunderstood
Who do? Who do? Who-don-na-na

Walk down the runway but don’t puke
It’s okay
You just had a salad today
Boulangerie
Just ask your gay friends their advice
Before you
Get a spray tan on holiday
In taipei

What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

Check it out
Take it in
’Cause that bitch
She’s so thin (voo-don-na-na)

She’s so rich
And so blonde
She’s so fab
It’s beyond

What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

Donatella (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Donatella (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
All of the day (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I’m gonna wear designer and forget your name
