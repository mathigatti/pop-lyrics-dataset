Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand
Inkin Lincoln, sand-script with a fan
Remembering me before it began
Sometimes I feel so Def in the Jam


But the ones who loved me, told me to stop
Like homegirl can't catch shit if it drops
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man

'Cuz I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous

Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone whose got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers

Don't want no paper gangsta uh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta uh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta

Got something really shiny to start
Want me to sign there on your Range Rover heart?
I've heard it before
Yeah, the dinners were nice
Till your diamond words melted into some ice

You should been rapping to the beat of my song
Mr. California, paper gangsta and
I'm lookin' for love, not an empty page
Full of stuff that means nothing but you've been played

'Cuz I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous

Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone whose got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers

Don't want no paper gangsta uh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta uh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta

Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone whose got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers

Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone whose got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers

Don't want no paper gangsta uh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta uh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
