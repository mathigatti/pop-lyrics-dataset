Oh tonight I'm gonna show
Them what I'm made of, oh
The killer queen inside me's coming to say hello


Oh tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you I'd watch them all be burned
Woah woah

Whenever I start feeling strong I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a warrior, I insist, it's my life

I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you
You'll see

I can be the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed it's happening
I can be the queen

I am wind and hurricane
The stormy sky and rain
When you run dry I'll flood your pain
Woah woah

In between the moments of
The lady I've become
A voice beats through the
Noise like drums
Rum pum pum pum

Whenever I start feeling strong I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman I insist, it's my life

I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you
You'll see

I can be the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed it's happening
The que ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-eeen
The queen queeen queeeen
Queen queeen queeeen
Queen queeen queeeen

Starry night
Come inside me like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to heaven's door

I will fly
On a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix
So you can remind them of the dream I bore
