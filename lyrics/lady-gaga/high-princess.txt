Where’s my stache high?
Want to get high guy


I need my

Where’s my stache?
Can you feed my love?

There’s no exit we're in Jean-Paul Sartre
Hope you don’t think my obsession is awkward

Princess Die High

There’s no particular thing that I want, want, want
There’s no particular drug that I love, love, love
But when I can’t find my stache I give up, up, up, up
I need to deal with myself and get messed up, messed up, messed up

Where’s my stache?
Can you feed my love
Cannabis
Can you feed my love?

Where’s my stache?
Where’s my stache?
Cannabis?
High Princess
Where’s my stache?

Anton, turn it up
Let’s party, let’s get messed up
Let’s get messed up
Let’s get messed up
You’re so messed up
Psychotic music head
