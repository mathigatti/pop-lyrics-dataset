All my friends are going out
But I've been thinking
Maybe I better stay in bed
The ceilings spinning round
Like I've been drinking
I've got this banging in my head


Boom Boom Boom
I need my Medicine
And the cure aint aspirin

I don't care about tomoro-o-o-o
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance flo-o-o-r
When this party ends, When this party ends
I don't even care (no), I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I was there
I don't even care (no), I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I was there

I sleep through the alarm
Head under pillow
I know I'm gonna pay for this
I can't stand missing out
So when you call me, call me
I say okay if you insist

Boom Boom Boom
I need my Medicine
And the cure aint aspirin

I don't care about tomoro-o-o-o
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance flo-o-o-r
When this party ends, When this party ends
I don't even care (no), I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I was there
I don't even care (no), I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I was there

Never wanna Stay Wish I was there
Never wanna Stay Wish I was there
Never wanna Stay Wish I was there

I don't care about tomoro-o-o-o
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance flo-o-o-r
When this party ends, When this party ends
I don't even care (no), I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I was there
I don't even care (no), I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I was there
