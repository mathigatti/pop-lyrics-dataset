Everybody's got to love each other
Stop throwin' stones at your sisters and your brothers
Man, it wasn't that long ago we were all living in the jungle
So why do we gotta put each other down
When there's more than enough love to g-g-go around?


Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Dude in a lab coat and a man of God
(Come on to mama, come on to mama)
Fought over prisms and a forty-day flood
(Come on to mama, come on to mama)

Well, I say rainbows did more than they've ever done
So why do we gotta fight over ideas?
We're talkin' the same old shit after all of these years

Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Psychic guru catches minnows in the harbor
(Come on to mama, come on to mama)
Everyone tells him he should work a little harder
(Come on to mama, come on to mama)
(Hey, man, get to work, catch up)

They all tell you that freedom must be bought
But, baby, he's already caught them
So why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in

Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Come to mama (come on to me)
(Woah, oh-oh oo oh-oo-oh)
Come on to mama
Come on to mama
Come on
Woohoo-hoo, woohoo hoo-oo-hoo
Woohoo-hoo, woohoo hoo-oo-hoo

'Cause I wanna be there
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be there

Why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in
Why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
Look what that rainbow did
Oo-hoo, woohoo-oo-hoo, woohoo-hoo
Oo-hoo, woohoo-oo-hoo, woohoo-hoo
