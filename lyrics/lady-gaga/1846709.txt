It's nothin' you can't handle babe,
Domino, not Splenda made.
So lick your lips and brace your tongue,
Get over here, you love me some.


[CJ Holland]:
I see you baby, and I got it bad.
I said it lady, I won't take it back.
I just don't know what's come over me,
But if you taste like you look,
Then you taste sugar sweet.

Girl,
So hot, make me lose my cool. (cool)
May I suggest we head to the room. (this room)
I just wanna be alone with you.
I'm young but I know what I wanna do.

Not saccharin or fake my dear.

Your sugarcane, on your mind.

Get over here, you love me some.
