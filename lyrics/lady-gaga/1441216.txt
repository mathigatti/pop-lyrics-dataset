No good boys ever go to heaven
But it's loving wonderland
Open mouth kiss and we dance
I can't believe c-c-c-can't believe that I met you


Pink champaigne
Merryround spinning round again
In this wonderland, where I met you

So dj play
Let the record spin again
In this wonderland, where I met you

Hold your breath, count to 11
Bodies moving wonderland
Open mouth kiss and we dance
I can't believe c-c-c-can't believe how I met you

Pink champaigne
Merryround spinning round again
In this wonderland, where I met you

So dj play
Let the record spin again
In this wonderland, where I met you

Talk to me baby
Talk to me baby
Talk to me baby

Talk to me baby
Take my hand
Talk to me baby
