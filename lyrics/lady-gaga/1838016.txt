I met a girl in east la
In floral shorts as sweet as may
She sang in eighths into barrio chords
We fell in love but not in court


I don't
I don't 

Ah, America, americano
Ah, America, americano

Mis canciones son de la re-revolución
Mi córazon me duele por mi generación
If yoü love me, we can marry on the west coast
On a Wednesday, en el verano, en agosto

I don't speak your
I don't speak your
Language, oh no!

I don't speak your (won't speak your)
I won't speak your (won't speak your)
Jesus Cristo

Ah, America, americano
Ah, America, americano

I will fight for, I have fought for how I love yoü
I have cried for, I will die for how I care
In the mountains, las campanas están sonando
Todos los chicos (chicas) y los chicos (chicas) están besando

I don't speak your
I don't speak your
Languagono

I don't speak your
I won't speak your
Jesus Cristo

I don't speak your (won't speak your)
I won't speak your (won't speak your)
Americano

I don't speak your (won't speak your)
I won't speak your (won't speak your)
Jesus Cristo

Ah, America, americano
Ah, America, americano
Ah, America, americano
Ah, America, americano

Don't you try to catch me
Don't you try to catch me
No, no, no, no
I'm living on the edge of
Living on the edge of
The law, law, law, law

Don't you try to catch me
Don't you try to get me
No, no, no, no
Don't you try to catch me
I'm living on the edge of
The law, law, law, law
