Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh


I, need somebody who calls my name
When clouds are smokin up my way
You get me through these cha-changing skies

I, don't wanna be afraid again
It's just that I could use a friend
You get me through these cha-changing skies

Give me something that I
Can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I cant handle now-iow
Believe me when I say
That I will be okay
And listen there's some voice
And my Cha-Changing skies

Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Changing skies
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I
Don't wanna be the kind to cry
I wanna dance right through the night
You get me through these cha-changing skies

Know, that I am not emotional
It's just that I dont wanna fall
Without my parachute tonight

Give me something that I
Can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I cant handle now-iow
Believe me when I say
That I will be okay
And listen to some advice
And my cha-changing skies

Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Changing skies
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
