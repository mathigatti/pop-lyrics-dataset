When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon
Is the only light we'll see


No, I won't, be afraid
Oh I won't
Be afraid
Just as long as you
Stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin'
Stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky
That we look upon,
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain
Should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long
As you stand
Stand by me

And darlin', darlin'
Stand, by me
Oh stand by me
Woah stand now
Stand by me
Stand by me

Darlin', darlin'
Stand, by me
Oh stand, by me
Oh stand now
Stand by me
Stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble,
Wont you stand by me, oh stand by me
Wow stand by me
Oh stand by me
