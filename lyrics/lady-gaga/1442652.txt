There he goes
My baby walks so slow
Sexual tic-tac-toe
Yeah, I know we both know
It isn't time
But would you be m-mine
We'll never get too far
Just you, me and the bar
So in a menage a trois sometimes
Would he be mine? Would he be mine?
Would you be m-mine?


Oh baby, lights on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever yeah

There it goes
You stole my soul and so
'Cause, sweetheart
A-no-no-nobody a-no-no-knows
They're occupied
Tell me you'll be mine
Let's get inside your car
Just you, me and the stars
Kind of menage a trois sometimes
Would he be mine? Would he be mine?
Could you be mine?
Yeah!

Oh baby, lights on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh baby, your lights on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever, yeah

Fever, fever, yeah
