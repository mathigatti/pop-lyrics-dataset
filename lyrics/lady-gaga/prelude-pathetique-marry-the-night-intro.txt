When I look back on my life
It's not that I don't want to see things exactly as they happened
It's just that I prefer to remember them in an artistic way


And truthfully, the lie of it all is much more honest
Because I invented it
Clinical psychology tells us, arguably, that trauma is the ultimate killer
Memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics
They can be lost forever

It's sort of like my past is an unfinished painting
And as the artist of that painting
I must fill in all the ugly holes
And make it beautiful again

It's not that I've been dishonest
It's just that I loathe reality
For example, those nurses
They're wearing next season Calvin Klein
And so am I

And the shoes, custom Giuseppe Zanotti
I tipped their gauze caps to the side like parisian berets
Because I think it's romantic
And I also believe that mint will be very big in fashion next spring

Check out this nurse on the right
She's got a great ass

Bam

The truth is, back then at the clinic
They only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair
And that girl on the left
She ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago
They only gave her the gummy bears
I'd wished they'd only given me the gummy bears
