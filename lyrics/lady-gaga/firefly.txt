I call her Firefly
'Cause, oh, my
She radiates moon glow
Wants none of that noon glow
She starts to glitter when the sun goes down


'Bout eight PM, it's mayhem
She switches those brights up
Lights up and gives me a call
Take me to the Fireflies ball

But when I get her there, set her there
Do I get to pet her there
Grab me some glow

No, she's a gad about, mad about
Luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch on to you know how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on me

He calls me Firefly
'Cause, oh, my
I radiates moon glow
Wants none of that noon glow
Starts to glitter when the sun goes down

'Bout eight PM, it's mayhem
I switch those brights up
Light up and give him a call
Take him to the Fireflies ball

But when I get 'er there, I set 'er there
Do I get to pet her there
Grab me some glow

Oh she's a gad about, a mad about
Luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch on to you know how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on
(Shine a little light on)
Shine a little light on me (On me)
In the mornin'
