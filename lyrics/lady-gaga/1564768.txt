I saw a shadow
And I knew that it wasn't mine
You and her I know that you were intertwined
Even though her clothes were on and everything
Your eyes were somewhere else and you were both to blame


Don't say a word, I'm sure that it won't be enough
To erase what I know
Just happens now what dreams are made of
This is my Haus and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you

'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
We went so wrong, that what you did
But I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wonderin' if I'm staying

The answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay
No way-ay-ay-ay
No way-ay-ay-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay

Thought that I saw something I know did not belong to me
But then I thought there was no way you would do that to me
And then last week when you went aside to use your phone
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold

And I just woke up but I wish that it was a nightmare
'Cause when I have those it isn't real like this one is
This is my heart and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you

'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
We went so wrong, that what you did
But I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wonderin' if I'm staying

The answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay
No way-ay-ay-ay
No way-ay-ay-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay

Get your things and go
You can take the dinner leftover from last night
I made you your favorite goodbye

'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
We went so wrong, that what you did
But I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wonderin' if I'm staying

The answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay
No way-ay-ay-ay
No way-ay-ay-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay

Ehh-ehh-ohh-noo way
No way
