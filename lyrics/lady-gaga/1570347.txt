I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro


She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you
Won't look at you
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger
Around you (ah)

You know that I love you, boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Stop, please
Just let me go, Alejandro
Just let me go

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, got-cool the bad

You know that I love you, boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Don't bother me
Don't bother me, Alejandro
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch, Fernando

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

(Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro)
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
(I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando)
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
(Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush)
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
(Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto)

Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
