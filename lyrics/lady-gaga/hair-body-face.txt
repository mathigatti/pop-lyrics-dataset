Hair, body, face
Hair, body, face


Your friends are in the other room
Heard every cruel thing they said
They're all just trying to be cool
So I wrote this song in my head
I'm not mad as long as I am perfect in your eyes, your eyes
Doesn't make a difference, yeah
As long as I am perfect in your eyes, your eyes

'Cause baby when I look at you
I just don't know what to do with you
A man loves a triple threat
Did the party room just see that?
Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat, do it, for ya
Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat

Try to leave here, but you won't let me leave
Saying that if I care what they think, I'll never succeed
I won't leave here, if you promise to me
I've got my hair, body, face (face)
Hair, body, face for you
(Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat, do it, for ya)
For you
(Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat)

Wasn't the it girl at school (not me)
No, I wasn't queen of the prom
But don't take me for a fool
Now I know I've got my own charm
I'm not mad as long as I am perfect in your eyes, your eyes
Doesn't make a difference, yeah
As long as I am perfect in your eyes, your eyes

'Cause baby when I look at you
I just don't know what to do with you
A man loves a triple threat
Did the party room just see that?

Try to leave here, but you won't let me leave
Saying that if I care what they think, I'll never succeed
I won't leave here, if you promise to me
I've got my hair, body, face (face)
Hair, body, face for you
(Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat, do it, for ya)
For you
(Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat, do it, for ya)

Everything is all right
When you look in my eyes
You lift me when I feel small
Triple threat, I've got it all
Everything's alright
When you look in my eyes
You lift me when I feel small
(Hair, body, face)

Try to leave here, but you won't let me leave
Saying that if I care what they think, I'll never succeed
I won't leave here, if you promise to me
I've got my hair, body, face (face)
Hair, body, face for you
(Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat, do it, for ya)
For you
(Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat, do it, for ya)
For you
(Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat, do it, for ya)
For you
(Hair, body, face, for you)
Hair, body, face, for you
