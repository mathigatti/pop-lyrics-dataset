Oh, oh, oh
Welcome to the panty circus
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Ladies and gentlemen, Lady Gaga (Gaga)


Who's that girl running round
With no clothes on, heels in the ground
Almost famous on the scene
She looks like a celebrity
Who's that girl, she's so shiny
Ain't no way her waist that tiny
Sequins in her hair
Homegirl doesn't care

Baby, shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties

Oh, oh, I lost my clothes, but everybody knows
We get naughty at the panty party
It's time to get undressed and make it glamorous
Let's get naughty at the panty party

Oh whoa, whoa, ah
Oh whoa, whoa, ah

What are you doing over there?
We're gonna play in underwear
Spanky pants, curious
Bubble wrapper, furious
Who's that girl, she's so pretty
Bet you she's from New York City
Sequins in her hair
Homegirl doesn't care

Baby, shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties

Oh, oh, I lost my clothes, but everybody knows
We get naughty at the panty party
It's time to get undressed and make it glamorous
Let's get naughty at the panty party

Oh whoa, whoa, ah
Oh whoa, whoa, ah
Oh whoa, whoa, ah
Oh whoa, whoa, ah

Baby, shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties
Baby, shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties

Oh, oh, I lost my clothes, but everybody knows
We get naughty at the panty party
It's time to get undressed and make it glamorous
Let's get naughty at the panty party
Oh, oh, I lost my clothes, but everybody knows
We get naughty at the panty party
It's time to get undressed and make it glamorous
Let's get naughty at the panty party
