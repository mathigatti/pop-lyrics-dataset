Io ritorne, Io ritorne
Io ritorne, Io ritorne

Government Hooker

I can be cool
I can be anything
I'll be your everything
Just touch me baby.

Back up and turn around
Dance on the ground
Back up and turn around
Get down

Hooker!
Hooker!
Hooker!
Government Hooker!

I'm gonna drink my tears tonight
I'm gonna drink my tears and cry
Cuz' I know you love me, baby
I know you love me, baby

I'm gonna drink my tears tonight
I'm gonna drink my tears and cry
Cuz' I know you love me, baby
I know you love me, baby

Put your hands on me, John F. Kennedy
I'll make you squeal baby

Hooker!
