Hey Babe.
I'm feeling something kinda crazy.
I know that we've got something special, boy.
But lately I've been feelin' naughtier.
Than usual.


You see I,
I need a love that's crazy, don't you see?
I'm lookin' for someone who can handle me.
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so.
I'm sorry when I met you that I did not know.
That you and me were kind of incomplete.
Need someone who's stayin' in love with me.
Give it up, Put it up.
Not enough, not enough.
Not enough, I need it.
Out of Control!

Give it up, just let'cho body.
Out of Control!
Give it up, just let'cho body.
Out of Control!
Give it up, just let'cho body.

Give it up, just let'cho body.
