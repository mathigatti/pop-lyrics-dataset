Songbird, rebirth, unearth creature
Submerge from hurt, pain, broken pieces
Emergency, heartbeat increases
Rise up lotus, rise, this is the beginning
This is the beginning
This is the beginning
This is the beginning

Songbird, rebirth, unearth creature
Submerge from hurt, pain, broken pieces
Emergency, heartbeat increases
Rise up lotus, rise, this is the beginning

And now the lotus rises
We are never dyin’
Forever flyin’
And always survivin’

Songbird, rebirth, unearth creature
Submerge from hurt, pain, broken pieces
Emergency, heartbeat increases
Rise up lotus, rise, this is the beginning
This is the beginning
This is the beginning
This is the beginning

Songbird, rebirth, unearth creature
Submerge from hurt, pain, broken pieces
Emergency, heartbeat increases
Rise up lotus, rise, this is the beginning
This is the beginning
This is the beginning

To the sky, I rise
Spread my wings, and fly
I leave the past behind
And say goodbye to the scared child inside
I sing for freedom, and for love
I look at my reflection
Embrace the woman I’ve become
The unbreakable lotus in me
I now set free
