She gets too hungry for dinner at eight (I'm starving)
She loves the theater and never comes late
I never bother with people that I hate
That's why this chick is a tramp


She doesn't like crap games with barons or earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
And I definitely won't dish our dirt with the rest of those girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I love the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
I'm so broke
It's "oke"

I hate California, it's crowded and damp
That's why the lady is a tramp (I'm a tramp)

Sometimes I go to Coney Island
Oh the beach is divine
And I love the yankees
... Is just fine
I follow...
She sings every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I love the...
That isn't a fake (no fakes)
And I love the.. with you and your wife in central park
She goes to the opera and stays wide awake (yes, I do)
That's why this lady is a tramp

She likes the green (green) grass (grass) under her shoes
What can I lose?
'cause I got no dough! oh no?
I'm all alone...
That's why the lady is a tramp

I love your free, fresh, I love your handkerchief in my hand
Life without care
But I'm so broke
That's "oke"
Hates California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
That's why this lady is a tramp
That's why the lady is a tramp
