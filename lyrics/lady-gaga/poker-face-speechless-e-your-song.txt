Excuse me! Excuse me! I have returned!
I bought a Lady Gaga, but she sold me a fake.
All my money looks great. Hahaha.
I want the real Gaga.
Can't fake it, gotta make it.
The real Gaga.
I want the... Poker Face. Won't fake it, gotta make.
Want the real Gaga.


You see the real Gaga comes complete with 5 number 1 singles.
And the best part is, she has her own disco stick. Hahaha.
And she has no soul. Hahaha
I'll take it.

[Lady Gaga]
I just wanna hold em' like they do in Texas plays
Fold em' let em' hit me, raise it baby stay with me, ooh yeah
LoveGame, intuition.
Play the cards with spades to start,
And after he's been hooked,
I'll play the one that's on his heart

(Mum mum mum mah), (Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah), (Mum mum mum mah)

I wanna hold em' like they do in Texas plays, (Ay)
Fold em' let em' hit me, raise it, baby stay with me

LoveGame intuition play the cards with spades to start,
And after he's been hooked,
I'll play the one that's on his heart

Can't read my, can't read my

[Dancers]
What's going on?
[Elijah Kelly]
Everyone is going goo goo for Gaga!
[Lady Gaga]
Stop! No!
[Elijah Kelly]
Her mind controlling pop music is ruining my business.
[Lady Gaga]
No!
[Elijah Kelly]
Take her away. She's a monster, she's a monster, she's a monster.
She's turnin' on you to the monster.
She's a monster, she's a monster, she's a monsteer.

[Lady Gaga]
Take my picture Hollywood.
I'm gonna be a star!
I can’t believe what you said to me
Last night when we were alone

[Elton John]
You threw your hands up
Baby you gave up, you gave up

[Lady Gaga]
I can’t believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes

[Elton John]
oh, in your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies
I know that it’s complicated

[Lady Gaga]
But I’m a loser in love, so baby
[Elton John]
Raise a glass to mend
[Lady Gaga]
All the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends

[Elton John]
Oh, I’ll never talk again
Oh boy you’ve left me speechless
You’ve left me speechless, so speechless

[Lady Gaga]
And I'll never love again
Oh friend, you’ve left me speechless
You’ve left me speechless, so speechless
And you can tell everybody

[Elton John]
Oh, this is your song

[Lady Gaga]
I hope you don't mind

[Elton john]
I hope you don't mind
And after all the boys and girls that we’ve been through

[Lady Gaga]
Would you give it all up?

[Elton John]
Could you give it all up?

[Lady Gaga]
If I promise boy, to you

[Elton John]
And you can tell everybody this is your song

[Lady Gaga]
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind

[Elton John]
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is with Gaga in the world

[Lady Gaga]
Oh, I’ll never write a song
Won’t, won't, won't even sing along
Thank you, love you
Sir Elton John..

So speechless
