There ain't no reason you and me should be alone tonight
Yeah, baby, tonight, yeah, baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong tonight


It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to
To the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you

I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

Another shot before we kiss the other side tonight
Yeah baby, tonight yeah baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight
Alright!
Alright!

Put on your shades 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames tonight
Yeah, baby, tonight, yeah, baby
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name tonight
Alright!
Alright!

It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to
To the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you

I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you

I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you
