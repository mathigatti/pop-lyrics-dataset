We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love


Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-

Run, run with her top down, baby, she flies
Run, run with the fury of a saint in her eyes
Run, run ha cha cha cha, baby, she goes
With blonde hair and a gun smoking under her toes

Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
Ride, ride, pony, ride, ride
Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
Ride, ride, pony, tonight

We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely road, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

I'm on the road oh, oh woah oh
I'm on the road to love
I'm on the road oh, oh woah oh
I'm on the road to love

She's just an American riding a dream
When she's got a rainbow syrup in her heart that she bleeds
They don't care if your papers or your love is the law
She's a, free soul burning roads with a flag in her bra

Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
Ride, ride, pony, ride, ride
Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
Ride, ride, pony, tonight

We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely road, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

I'm on the road oh, oh woah oh
I'm on the road to love
I'm on the road oh, oh woah oh
I'm on the road to love

Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna drink until we die

Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna drink until we die, die, die
