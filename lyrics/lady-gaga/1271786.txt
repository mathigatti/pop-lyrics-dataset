Beautiful and dirty, dirty rich, rich dirty

We've got a redlight pornographic, dance fight
Systematic, honey
But we got no money

Our hair is perfect while we're all getting shit-wrecked
It's automatic, honey
But we got no money

Daddy I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah
We just like to party, like to p-p-party, yeah

Bang bang
We're beautiful 'n dirty rich
Bang bang
We're beautiful 'n dirty rich

We live a cute-life
Soundfematic,
Pants tighter than plastic, honey
But we got no money

We do the dance right
We have got it made like
Ice cream topped with honey
But we got no money

Daddy I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah
We just like to party, like to p-p-party, yeah
