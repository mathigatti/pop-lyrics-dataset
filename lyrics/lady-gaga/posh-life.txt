He went to them
They turned away
He just wanted something to eat
A place to love, a place to pray


In God we trust
And it’s okay
He said, "I’m black, latin and gay
I went to them, they turned away"

When life is holding you down
And you’re having trouble finding peace
You gotta be brave
Be brave until you bleed

When life is holding you heart
In a place that it don’t want to be
You’ve got a posh life
'Cause life is all you need

We live a posh life
The world says we’re not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us, believe
We live a posh life
We're nothing but our leather and our dreams
We gotta trust in the future of us, believe
Posh life, posh life, posh life
Posh life until you bleed

Grew up north of the Florida bay
Nineteen, moved to the big city
To find a dream, to find a way

Burning concrete of lower east
Inscribe in Sharpie William’s “h”
Passionately only serving him, yeah

When life is holding you down
And you’re having trouble finding peace
You gotta be brave
Be brave until you bleed

When life is holding you heart
In a place that it don’t want to be
You’ve got a posh life
'Cause life is all you need

We live a posh life
The world says we’re not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us, believe

Posh life, we live a posh life
We’re nothing but our love and our dreams
You gotta trust in the future of us, believe
Posh life, we live a posh life, a posh life
Posh life until you bleed
Posh life, we live a posh life, posh life
Live life until you bleed

This ain't no chapel
Ain’t no pauper’s prison
We love this posh life
For just one reason

We got each other
When the church ain’t given
We love this posh life
Just for one reason

We live a posh life
The world says we’re not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us, believe

We live a posh life
We’re nothing but our love and our dreams
We gotta trust in the future of us, believe
Posh life, we live a posh life, a posh life
Posh life until you bleed
Posh life, we live a posh life, posh life
Posh life until you bleed
