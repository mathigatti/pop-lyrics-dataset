I always thought it was you
You always thought it was me
We always thought we were it
Seemed like a real perfect fit
Those brooklyn nights set us free!
I always thought even though
We were so young we could grow up
And in the end it would be us
We would take the f by the bus
Where brooklyn nights set us free


Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I really over it, you know, you know
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
Where we used to be
Brooklyn nights happy!

I miss that cheap chandelier
Remember when dad hung it there
We would watch rocky four
The one where the russian scored
I love brigitte nielsens hair
I'd cry you're my champion
But we had already won
And cracked open one last beer
Falling asleep in our tears
Those Brooklyn nights set us free!

Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I really over it, you know, you know
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
Where we used to be
Brooklyn nights happy!

I found an old pair of keys in my purse
That opened the lockup we shared
How did they get there, jerk.?
I wanna see you there
I wanna make it work
I didn't brush my hair
And my lashes are falling
After seven years of our bad luck dating
I want one last night there
A Brooklyn night affair

Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I really over it, you know, you know
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
Where we used to be
Brooklyn nights happy!

It's not that I don't want to love you
'Cause I really tried and I
Just wanna hang with the ol' you
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu!

Have a drink with you for myself
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we both tell the truth
For one just more Brooklyn night, adieu!
