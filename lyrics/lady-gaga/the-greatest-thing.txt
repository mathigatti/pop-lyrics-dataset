I don't wa-wanna waste another day
Without telling you that, baby, you're great
And I can see it written on your face
G-R-E-A-T
Something you can face


'Cause when I'm with you I fall apart
To heal your permanently broken heart
Baby, you're the greatest to me
No, no matter what, what, what

I don't know why you hurt inside
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see
You are the greatest thing to me
And when
You're feeling like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see
You are the greatest, greatest thing to me

When all your thoughts are dark and insecure
I'll build you a light, cause baby, I'm sure
That loving you has made me better
I'll take all your shadows
And make sure that you shine
'Cause when I'm with you I fall apart
I hear your permanently broken heart
Baby, you're the greatest to me
And no, no matter what, what, what

The greatest thing, greatest thing, greatest thing to me
I will repeat myself so I know that you're l-listening
The greatest thing, greatest thing, greatest thing to me
I will repeat myself so I know you're l-listening
'Cause when I'm with you I fall apart
To heal your permanently broken heart
Baby, you're the greatest to me
No, no matter what, what, what

I don't know why you hurt inside
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see
You are the greatest thing to me
And when
You're feeling like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see
You are the greatest, greatest thing to me
