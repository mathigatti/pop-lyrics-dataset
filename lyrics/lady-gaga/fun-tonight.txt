Feelin' something that I can't explain (oh)
Think it's a wound I still entertain (oh)
I'd do anything to numb the flame (oh)
I guess I'm just on fire these days (oh)
I can't see straight, I can't see me
There's too much hurt caught in between
Wish I could be what I know I am
This moment's hijacked my plans


I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too

Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight

You love the paparazzi, love the fame
Even though you know it causes me pain
I feel like I'm in a prison hell
Stick my hands through the steel bars and yell
What happens now? I'm not okay
And if I scream, you walk away
When I'm sad, you just wanna play
I've had enough, why do I stay?

I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too

Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not havin' fun tonight
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not havin' fun tonight

Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight
