Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face


Amidst all of these flashing lights
I pray that fame won't take my life

We are the crowd, we're co-coming out
Got my flash on it's true, need that picture of you
It's so magical, we'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means, but this photo of us
It don't have a price, ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi
Baby there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Papa-Paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind, but I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

I'll be your girl backstage at show
Velvet ropes and guitars, yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar
In between the sets, eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt, yellow dance and return
My lashes are dry, purple teardrops I cry
It don't have a price, loving you is Cherry Pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi
Baby there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Papa-Paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind, but I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Real good, we're dancing in the studio
Snap, snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop, for anyone
We're plastic but we still have fun

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi
Baby there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Papa-Paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind, but I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
