Boy we've had a real good time
And I wish you the best
On your way
Eh, eh

I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought we'd fall
Out of place
Eh, eh

I had something that i love long long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me that something's wrong
Then I met someone
And, eh, there's nothing else I can say

Eh, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh, eh, I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh, eh

Not that I don't care about you
Just that things got so compliqu√©
Eh, eh

I met somebody cute and funny
Got each other and that's money eh
Eh, eh

I had something that I love long long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me that something's wrong
Then I met someone
And, eh, there's nothing else I can say

Eh, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh, eh, I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh, eh

I had something that I love long long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me that something's wrong
Then I met someone
And, eh, there's nothing else I can say

Eh eh wish he never looked at me that way
