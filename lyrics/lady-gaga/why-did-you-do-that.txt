Why do you look so good in those jeans?
Why'd you come around me with an ass like that?
You're making all my thoughts obscene
This is not, not like me
Why you keep on texting me like that? (damn)
Got other things I need my mind on, yeah
Other responsibilities
This is not, not like me


Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

Boy, could you please stop being so fine?
When I stare at you I wish I were blind
'Cause I begin to lose control
No I can't, can't let go
'Cause ever since I met you I've been praying on my knees
That you would always stay around, that you would never leave
But I'm the kind of girl that always needs to be free
Why did you do that to me?

Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
(Why did you do that?)

I can't stop talking about what you do to me
You keep keeping me from how I'm supposed to be
To be

Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
(Do that to me)
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
(Why you do that?)
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
(Why?)
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
