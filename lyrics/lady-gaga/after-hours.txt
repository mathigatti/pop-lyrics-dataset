If you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the wineglass out
And drink a toast to never


Oh, someday I know someone
Will look into my eyes
And say hello, you're my very special one
But if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again

Dark cloudy bars
Shiny Cadillac cars
And the people on subways and trains

Looking gray in the rain
As they stand disarrayed
All the people look well in the dark

And if you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out
And say hello to never

All the people are dancing
And they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me
'Cause if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again
I'd never have to see the day again
(Once more)
I'd never have to see the day again
