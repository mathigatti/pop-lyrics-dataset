Can't help myself, I'm in love
And when I get back from outer space
I'm gonna punch him in his face
Tears run
'Cause bad that boy
Got me twisted... Ah
If he's the Moon, then I'm eclipsed
I'm so lunar yeah when I get to him
I'll run him over with my rocket ship


My eyeliner runs
In constellations for you dear
If only I could reboot my
Mechanical heart
I'd think clear

Baby I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby with you I'm a different girl
Oh, you're my future love
Baby could we make a hole in the stars
Baby somewhere in the galaxy far
Oh, you're my future love

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-future love?
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-future man?
I wanna fu-fuck you hard as I can
Would you put me in your fu-future plans
I want a fu-fu-fu-fu-future man

Ah
I've been working in engineering
All our chemestries and our situations
Working out our sex equations
And I know, I'm no Nostradamus, yeah
'Cause my hair is blonde, but my heart's brunette
If I'm not on you, then at least I'm honest

My mascara runs in constellations
For you dear
My dear
If only I could space my brain
For a minute
I'd think clear

Baby I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby with you I'm a different girl
Oh, you're my future love
Baby could we make a hole in the stars
Baby somewhere in the galaxy far
Oh, you're my future love

Oh
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
I want you fo-fo-for love you, for love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu-future man
I wanna fu-fuck you hard as I can
Would you put me in your my fu-future plans
I want a fu-fu-fu-fu-future man

Fuel me up and take me in
To a place where we've never been
He's so unreal, he's a mannequin
A synthetic, plastic rubber man
I'll buy a flying car on a shooting star
To get to you my future love
He's my rubber hunk
My mechanical guy
And I'm stuck in his metal
Rubber eyes, rubber eyes
My future guy
