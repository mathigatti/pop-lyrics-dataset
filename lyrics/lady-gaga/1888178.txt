My heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover
My heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover

I want your whiskey mouth
All over my blonde south
Red wine and cheap perfume
And a filthy pout

Tonight bring all your friends
Because a group does it better
Why river with a pair
Let's have a full house of leather

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who
Heavy metal lover

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who
Heavy Metal lover

Dirty pony I can't wait to hose you down
You've got to earn your leather in this part of town
Dirty pearls and a patch for all the Rivington Rebels
Let's raise hell in the streets drink beer and get into trouble

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who
Heavy metal lover

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who
Heavy Metal lover

I could be your girl girl girl girl girl girl
But would you love me if I ruled the world world world?

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who
Heavy metal lover

Whip me slap me, punk funk
New York clubbers, bump drunk
Budlite liquors, bar slam
Move it, this is your jam
Wash the night, with St. Jameson
Like a baptism
Heavy metal lovers play
Because we born this way

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who
Who-who-who ooh-who-who

Heavy metal lover

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who
Heavy metal lover

I could be your girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But would you love me if I ruled the world, world, world?

Heavy metal lover
