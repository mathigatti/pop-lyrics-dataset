Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as


Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Gaga

Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Gaga

When he calls to me I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

Ah-ah-ahhh-ow, ah-ah-ahhh-ow
I'll bring him down, bring him down down
Ah-ah-ahhh-ow, ah-ah-ahhh-ow
A king with no crown, king with no crown

I'm just a holy fool
Oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool
Oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Gaga

I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick, you can
Build a house or sink a dead body

Ah-ah-ahhh-ow, ah-ah-ahhh-ow
I'll bring him down, bring him down down
Ah-ah-ahhh-ow, ah-ah-ahhh-ow
A king with no crown, king with no crown

I'm just a holy fool
Oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool
Oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Ew!

In the most biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me if offenced, or wear ear condom next time

I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue
And Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

I'm just a holy fool
Oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool
Oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Juda-ah-as
Judas, Gaga
