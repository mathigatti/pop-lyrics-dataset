I don't want to rule the world
It's a change I'm here to see
I walk along on a lonely road
Of many wonders to believe


You can try to hear their talk
Or sell it out, a masterpiece
You got a trunk full of gold
I got someone to believe

This ain't about kings or queens
In a battle you and me
Do you need a dose of truth?
What am I supposed to do?
How can you deal with it?
Do you just avoid the guilt?

There's something you gotta know
If you can't deal with me
Shut your mouth
Sip on that tea

It's been so long since
I've had a sip and I get this feeling
I need a green detox
The truth will be the winner tonight
