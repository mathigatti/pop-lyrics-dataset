Hello everybody!
Get a ride to the west side
Kiss the girl with her tongue tide


Hello everybody!
Well get out cause you don't care
Sit down like software

Hello everybody!
Take a sip for the hip-hop
If you look for the rest stop

We're just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the fra-disco scene

Retro, dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance ...)
Singing with her dance beat
Retro, dance, freak!
Undercover the girl needs a lover

Whats up everybody?
Take a ride on the air plane
Take a bath in champagne

Whats up everybody?
Watch the girl curtsy for the paparazzi!

Let's go everybody!
It's time that we rotate, 'cause it's getting real late

We're just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the fra-disco scene

Retro, dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance ...)
Singing with her dance beat (retro, retro, freak ...)
Retro, dance, freak!
Undercover the girl needs a lover

Retro, dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance ...)
Singing with her dance beat (retro, retro, freak ...)
Retro, dance, freak!
Undercover the girl needs a lover

Retro, dance, freak!
Singing with her dance beat
Retro, dance, freak!
Undercover the girl she needs a lover

We're just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the fra-disco scene

Retro, dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance ...)
Singing with her dance beat (retro, retro, freak ...)
Retro, dance, freak!
Undercover the girl needs a lover

Retro, dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance ...)
Singing with her dance beat (retro, retro, freak ...)
Retro, dance, freak!
Undercover the girl needs a lover (fade)
