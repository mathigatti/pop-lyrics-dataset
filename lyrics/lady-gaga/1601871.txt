Baby, I've got a lot of questions
You better listen up please
I wanna know what you want and need
To charge up your batteries
You got the flow and the intention
Boy but have you got the mouth
Show me that you've got the ammunition
That you're good for a while
For a while
For a while


Charge it up, because, ba-by, you could be mine
I don't need a red soldier
I need you to reload it
Bring it reloaded
Charge it up, 'cause, baby, I'm one of a kind
I don't need a red soldier
I need you to reload it
Bring it reloaded

Reloaded, loaded
Lo-oaded, lo-oaded
Reloaded, loaded
Relo-oa-de-ed, lo-oa-de-ed
Reloaded, loaded
Lo-oaded, lo-oaded
Reloaded, lo-oaded
Relo-oa-de-ed, lo-oa-de-ed

You had better rest up your energy
You better reserve yourself
Cause tonight I'm expecting to get plenty
And I wont do it myself
Conserve your juices cause I'm gonna
Take you on a marathon
I'm not ridiculous, I'm just a girl
Who like's a man who can go long
Can go long
Can go long

Charge it up, because, ba-by, you could be mine
I don't need a Red Soldier
I need you to reload it
Bring it reloaded
Charge it up, 'cause, babe, I'm of a kind
I don't need a red soldier
I need you to reload it
Bring it reloaded

Reloaded, loaded
Lo-oaded, lo-oaded
Reloaded, loaded
Relo-oa-de-ed, lo-oa-de-ed
Reloaded, loaded
Lo-oaded, lo-oaded
Reloaded, lo-oaded
Relo-oa-de-ed, lo-oa-de-ed

Baby, you can check for yourself
I'm gonna spin you when I doubt I'm gonna do you right
And I wont complain if your Buggin
Can't handle my lovin tonight
Tonight

Yo, mama, get low, mama
Hit the floor mama
Black like Obama
Mad like Osama
I'mma get the drama
I've got the hall light
If you've got the tosser
Say what?
Say what?
Hold up, before this room blow up
I'm gonna release the clip, there be no other

Charge it up, because, ba-by, you could be mine
I don't need a red soldier
I need you to reload it
Bring it reloaded
Charge it up, 'cause, babe, I'm one of a kind
I don't need a red soldier
I need you to reload it
Bring it reloaded
