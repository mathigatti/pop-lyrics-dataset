It's been a hard day, harder night.
The rockstar's, girlfriend, she lost the fight.
Well it's all right baby, I'm nobody's mother,
When you don't want the last cigerette to be over.


You fooled me again, fooled me again,
With your honest, honest, honest eyes,
Again, fooled me again, with your dirty mouth,
Full of honest lies.
Again, oh when, you fooled me again, oh yeah.
You're so honest, full of, honest eyes.

It's been two days, since he left home.
She dried her eyes, picked up her microphone.
She sang, it's all right baby,
I'm nobodys mother,
But I dont want this last cigerette to be over.

You fooled me again, fooled me again,
With your honest, honest, honest eyes,
Again, fooled me again, with your dirty mouth,
Full of honest lies.
Again, oh when, you fooled me again, oh yeah.
You're so honest, full of, honest eyes.

You fooled me again, fooled me again,
With your honest, honest, honest eyes,
Again, fooled me again, with your dirty mouth,
Full of honest lies.
Again, oh when, you fooled me again, oh yeah.
You're so full of it, full of honest,
ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eyes.
Again, honest, honest, so freakin' honest.
na na nana na na nanananana.
You're so full of it,
At least your honest eyes.
