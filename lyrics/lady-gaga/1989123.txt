Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone I'll tell them my religion's you
When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones


I'll dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head head head

I'll dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head head head

We are not just art for Michelangelo
To carve he can't rewrite the agro
Of my furied heart I'll wait
On mountain tops in Paris cold
Je ne veux pas mourire tout seule

I'll dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head head head

I'll dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head head head

I'll dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head head head

I'll dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head head head
