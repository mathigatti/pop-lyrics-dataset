(So-sour candy)


I'm sour candy, so sweet then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho, make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ask me to be nice and then I’ll do it extra mean

Uh-huh, uh-huh

I'm hard on the outside but if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside but if you see inside, inside, inside

I might be messed up, but I know what's love
You want a real taste, at least I'm not afraid
Come, come unwrap me
Come, come unwrap me
I'll show you what's me
Close your eyes, don't peek
Now I'm undressin'
Unwrap sour candy
Come, come unwrap me
Come, come unwrap me
Come on, sour candy

I'm hard on the outside but if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside but if you see inside, inside, inside

I'm sour candy, so sweet then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho, make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Take a bite, take a bite
So-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite
So-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite
So-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite
Sour candy
