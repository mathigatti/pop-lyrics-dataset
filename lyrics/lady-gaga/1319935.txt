Thats m-o-n-e-y, so sexy, I

Damn, I love the jag, the jet and the mansion
Oh, yeah
And I enjoy the gifts and the trips to the islands
Oh, yeah


It's good to live expensive
You know it, but my knees get weak intensive

When you give me k-kisses
That's money honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money honey
Baby when you tear me to pieces
That's money honey

Thats m-o-n-e-y, so sexy, I

Damn, I'd love a boat by the beach on the west coast
Oh, yeah
And I'd enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast
Oh, yeah

It's good to live expensive
You know it but my knees get weak intensive

When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby when you tear me the pieces
That's money, honey

You know I appreciate the finer things
But it's not what makes me happiest baby
(I can do without it babe)
Your tender loving's more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle baby, baby

K-k-k-k-kisses, that's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
Thats money, honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
Thats money, honey
Baby when you tear me the pieces
Thats money, honey

When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby when you tear me the pieces
That's money, honey

When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby when you tear me the pieces
That's money, honey

That's m-o-n-e-y, so sexy, I
