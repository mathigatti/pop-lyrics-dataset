We don’t care what people say
We know the truth
Enough is enough of this horse shit
I am not a freak, I was born with my free gun
Don’t tell me I’m less than my freedom


I’m a bitch
I'm a loser, baby, maybe I should quit
I'm a jerk
Wish I had the money but I can't find work
I'm a brat
I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried
Till they got divorced 'cause I ruined their lives

I'm a bad kid
And I'll survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right
I'm a bad kid
And this is my life
One of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right
(This is my life)

Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

I'm a twit
Degenerate, young rebel and I'm proud of it
Pump your fist
If you would rather mess up than put up with this
I'm a nerd
I chew gum and smoke in your face
I'm absurd
I'm so bad and I don't give a damn
I love it when you're mad
When you're mad, when you're mad

I'm a bad kid
And I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right
I'm a bad kid
And this is my life
One of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right
(This is my life)

Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

I'm not that typical, baby
I'm a bad kid
Like my mom and dad made me
I'm not that cool and you hate me
I'm a bad kid that's the way that they made me

I'm a bad kid I'm disastrous
Give me your money or I'll hold my breath
I'm a bad kid
And I'll survive
One of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right

Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby

A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
