Groove, slam, work it back, filter that, baby bump that track
Groove, slam, work it back, filter that, baby bump that track
Groove, slam, work it back, Space Cowboy just play that track
Gaga in the room, so starstruck, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, boom, boom


Rollin' up to the club on the weekend
Stylin' out to the beat that you're freakin'
Fantasize I'm the track that you're tweakin'
Blow my heart up

Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Cue me up I'm the twelve on your table
I'm so starstruck

I'm so starstruck
Baby cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up

I'm so starstruck
Baby cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby, cause you blow my heart up

Baby now that we're alone, gotta request
Would you make me number one on your playlist?

Got your Dre headphone, with the leftside on
Wanna scratch me back and forth back and forth? Uh-huh

Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with the original flavor
Get the breakdown first
Up until the chorus to the verse (re-ke-re-ke-reverse)

I'm so starstruck
Baby cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up

I'm so starstruck
Baby cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby, cause you blow my heart up

Hey, lil mamma like really, really is that him
I done seen you before what you got an them big rims
Enter that cash flow, I'm like baby you don't trip

So shawty say hand over you signature right here
Like adjust the dolted line and I supposed to sign
How she at it a fanatic and I think it's goin' down
She so starstruck, the gal all stuck
I should have had an overdose too many Starbucks

Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Notice who let the top back on the Chevy Impalas
Hummers and all that fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars

But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
Complete swagga, they go the dagger
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after

I'm so starstruck
Baby cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up

I'm so starstruck
Baby cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby, cause you blow my heart up

Groove, slam, work it back, filter that, baby bump that track
Groove, slam, work it back, filter that, baby bump that track
Groove, slam, work it back, filter that, baby bump that track
Groove, slam, work it back, filter that, baby bump that track

Baby now that we're alone, gotta request

Baby cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up

I'm so starstruck
Baby cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby, cause you blow my heart up
Blow my heart up

I'm so
I'm so
