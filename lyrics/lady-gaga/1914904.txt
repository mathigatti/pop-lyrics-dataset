It's funny how things, they change,
The clouds they part, rearrange for me
Faces of strangers and I have no familiars to help me see
Where is home?
I want you to know


That I wish you were here
I wish you were here

Sometimes I wonder if God hides out in cities
To set us free
Cuz yeah this room is crowded but I am so alone in it,
Help me please
Where is home?
I want you to know

That I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

And I will be strong
I won't give in
I won't deny you
I know where we've been

I am so much more
Than all of my fears
Than all of these tears
My tears, yeah

I wish you were here
I wish you were here

Where is home?
I want you to know

That I wish you were here
I wish you were here
