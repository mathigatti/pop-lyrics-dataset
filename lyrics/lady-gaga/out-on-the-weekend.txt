See the lonely girl
Out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay


She can't relate to joy, oh-oh
She tries to speak and,
Can't begin to say

The boy fooled me again
Ooh, he loves me all up
But I'm so down today-ay-ay, yeah

See the lonely girl
In Hollywood on the weekend
Trying to make it pay

[She start to play "Fooled Me Again"]
