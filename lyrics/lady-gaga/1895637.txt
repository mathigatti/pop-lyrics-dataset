Your mom says: Hi, jinx!

Summertime in the city
And everybody's having sex
You know I just got a page from a girl
That I met last week at the payless shoe stores
I also have a cutie to call
Who likes the way I knock on her boots


Well let's help them back
Let's handle that
In two-to-six hours
We'll meet back here and regroup
Now let's shoop
Roll up to her crib with some bartles &amp; james
Hop off the buss with the aliz√©
Now hold up player, whatchu diggity-doing here?
I should diggity-ask you the same

And she sang
Hey, boys I want you both
I hope that you think that's cool
(Say word?)
I know most guys won't freak together
She forgot about the golden rule 
It's ok to put us in a three-way
It's not gay when it's in a three-way
With a honey in the middle there's some leeway
The area's grey in a one, two, three-way
Normally, I don't get down with dudes
But tonight is a special exception (great)
See you're my best friend
Through thick and thin

Now it's time to make a triple connection
Lights off
Here in the dark (here in the dark)
It's so hard to tell (so hard to tell)
Where her body ends (la la)
And my homie's begins (ew wee)
This rule dates back (the golden rule)
To ancient Greece (takin' about cesar)
We're two Jack trippers and a chrissy
The new three's company

It's ok to put us in a three-way
It's not gay when it's in a three-way
With a honey in the middle there's some leeway
The area's grey in a one, two three-way
Fellas. Get ready
To impress the chick
Helicopter dick, go!
Hellicopter dick, helicopter dick
To impress chick
Helicopter dick
And all of that was ok
'Cuz it was in a three-way
It's right there when you see the instant replay (boom)
Maybe two is enough
That's what they'll say
But we'll say: Hell no
It's a one, two, three-way
