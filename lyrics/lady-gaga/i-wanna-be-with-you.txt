It's off, It's on
The party's just begun
Take off and run
Let's celebrate the fun of being young.
I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna grow up


But when the lights come on
you lift me up and I feel strong

I won't be right without you
and I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone

I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how we'll get through
I'll keep on singing for a living
but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you

I wanna be with you

Lights off, lights on
The music has begun
Merliah run
Get the bad guys gun
I love the songs that you play
And I don't care what they say
Cause I was born this way

I hear you scream
I hit the top of the stage and
Close my eyes and know exactly who I am
Oh woah oh

I won't be right without you
and I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone

I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how we'll get through
I'll keep on singing for a living
but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you

I won't be right without you
and I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone

I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how we'll get through
I'll keep on singing for a living
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Wanna be with you

I wanna be
No matter what breaks me
I wanna be with you
