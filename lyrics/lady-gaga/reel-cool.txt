Hey there weatherman,
What's your name?
Hey, hey.
In this corporation,
The prediction's a high roller game.

Put your hands together for the pony scene.
There's a boat with a sail and some real whip cream.
Ladies on the winning team,
Yeah, all the boys karaoke scream.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ooh, ooh.
Real cool.

Put your cute thing out of my flow, Joe.
Baby, watch yourself and the records,
And no, we don't mess around,
When it comes to being fabulous.
We are real cool,
Keep it real cool.

Real cool.
Huh, huh.
Real, real cool.

Hey there weather girl,

Choose some kind of trap,
But force your hand and a smoking chain.
