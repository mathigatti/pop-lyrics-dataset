You've gotta lotta, lotta nerve

Coming here when I'm still with him
And I care of you, it isn't fair
Born, march of eighty six, my birthday's coming
And if I had one wish, yeah, you'd be it


When you're 'round
I lose myself
Inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes
Like no one else
Baby, make it to me

Again and again, again
Again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again, again
Again, again, again
Never stop

He never really saw me or waited when we
Were hooking up, yeah, he'd a never last
Last week when I was sad, you said that you knew
My eyes changed of kinda green to kinda of blue

When you're 'round
I lose myself
Inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes
Like no one else
Baby, make it to me

Again and again, again
Again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again, again
Again, again, again
Never stop

They tell me if I leave him
Baby, would you be there?
'Cause maybe you could
Be mine all the time
