On a clear day,
Rise and look around you,
And you'll see who you are
On a clear day,
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being
Outshines every star


You'll feel part of every mountain,
Sea and shore,
You can hear from far and near
A world you've never heard before

And on a clear day,
On that clear day,
You can see forever,
And ever more
