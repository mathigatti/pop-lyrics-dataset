Here we go!

I can't wait to smoke them all
Whole pack like Marlboro
Blow it in your face, blow it in your face
Blow it in your, blow it in your face


I can't wait to rev you up
Faster than you can say Ferrari
Tearin' up the gravel, watch you unravel
Now it's a party

Hey, I can't wait to cast my spell
Which one, you'll never tell
'Cause I got it covered, city gravy southern
Got you drippin' like no other

Get off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceilin'
Off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceiling

A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO

I can't wait to blaze for real
Track burns like a road rail
Spin it in your face, spin it in your face
Play it in your, play it in your face

Can't wait to get you shook up
Faster than you can try to hate it
You can try to hate it, you can try to fake it
But, baby, I laced it

Get off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceilin'
Off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceiling

A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceiling (we smokin' 'em all)
A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceiling (we smokin' 'em all)
A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceiling (we smokin' on 'em all)
A-YO, A-YO
Aaaa-YO
A-YO

A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all

Hey
Get it, get it

Get off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceilin'
Off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceiling

A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceiling (we smokin' 'em all)
A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceiling (we smokin' 'em all)
A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceiling (we smokin' on 'em all)
A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceiling

Get get you, get you shook up, babe
Woo

A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all

A-YO
A-YO
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all

A-YO
