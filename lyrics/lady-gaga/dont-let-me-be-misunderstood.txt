Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I am mad
Don't ya know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad


But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ya know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I've got more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

Oh, baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting foolish things
Some simple things I've done

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please, please don't let me be misunderstood
