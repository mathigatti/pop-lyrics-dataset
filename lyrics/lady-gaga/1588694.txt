Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh oh, whoa oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, a oh-oh oh


I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets that I used to own

Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, a oh oh oh

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king! "
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
My missionaries hiding in foreign trenches

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an h-h-h-h-honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, a oh-oh oh

It was the wicked and a wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I've become

Revolutionaries wait
For my blonde head on a silver plate
Just a GaGa on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be queen?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
My missionaries hiding in foreign trenches

For some reason that I can't explain
I know Yves Saint Laraunt no he won't call my name
Never an h-h-h-h-honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Now I'm doing my very best not to mess up all the words but, a strong apology to coldplay, but I think otherwise it's a good job

Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
The Fame won't change us if we don't let it

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Mary won't call my name
Never an h-honest word
But that was when I ruled the world, ruled the world
Ru-u-u-uled the world
Viva La Vida
