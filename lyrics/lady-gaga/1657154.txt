(live on Saturday Nigh Live)

Born in New York, in Lenox Hill of '86
Cheered for the Yankees with my dad in Section 6
And after traveling, just dancing round the world
I still prefer a beer and whiskey with my friends on Rivington street


Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(He's got me like nobody)
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(He's got me like nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
Ah, ah
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face

I miss every little thing about the city
Subway trains
The girls are pretty
Love the hot dogs on 72nd street
They're tasty and they're cheap
Was just a waitress on Cornelia
Now I'm living my dreams baby, oh
Singing about my Poker Face
New York
It's Saturday night
