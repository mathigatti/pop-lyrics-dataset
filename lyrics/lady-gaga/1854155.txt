I feel like I got the world in the palm of my hands
It's like I'm with you when nobody else is here yeah
Me and you in here together are perfect
Just come a little closer, oh, yeah, yeah
Hold on to me, and feel the music
Free yourself tonight


Oh, just do watcha want, watcha want
Like nobodies watchin'
Do watcha want watcha want
Keep the party rockin'
What what what
Give it up
Like nobodies watchin'
You know
The rhythms calling you
Lose control
The rhythms calling you

I can't seem to get this curiosity out my head
'Cause when I'm next to you, you make me wanna take you there
Whatever you need, you can find in me
'Cause I feel like boy touch me there
Chemistry is flowing, keep me going dont stop baby
Hold on to me, and feel the music
Free yourself tonight

Oh, just do watcha want, watcha want
Like nobodies watchin'
Do watcha want watcha want
Keep the party rockin'
What what what
Give it up
Like nobodies watchin'
You know
The rhythms calling you
Lose control
The rhythms calling you

Calling you
Calling you

The rhythms calling you
The rhythms calling you
The rhythms calling you

Oh, just do watcha want watcha want
Like nobodies watchin'
Do watcha want watcha want
Keep the party rockin'
What what what
Give it up
Like nobodies watchin'
You know
The rhythms calling you
Lose control

Oh, just do watcha want watcha want
Like nobodies watchin'
Do watcha want watcha want
Keep the party rockin'
What what what
Give it up
Like nobodies watchin'
You know
The rhythms calling you
Lose control
The rhythms calling you

Oh, just do watcha want watcha want
Like nobodies watchin'
Do watcha want watcha want
Keep the party rockin'
What what what

Like nobodies watchin'
You know
The rhythms calling you
Lose control
The rhythms calling you
