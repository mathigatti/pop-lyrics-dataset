What do you saw? Get outta here kid

One lost lady in the radio creep
Got your hands in my pockets while you spinnin the beat
The vans spins fast while we trippin' on that
She said: The kids dance too
One trick bunny and the haunting man
Got lost in the woods with a gun in the head
She said: Hey love child, take me back
I said: The kids dance too


Shake your head cause she wants to
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming off the girls names
Feel so retrosexual (sexual)

Heard a story bout the medicine man
Drove straight to the coast in his minivan
He learned the ways of the local dudes
He said: The kids dance too
Missy Brown went to pristine high
Met the medicine man for a token around
She said: It's been so long since we got down
He said: I can't stand still

Shake your head cause she wants to
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming off the girls names
Feel so retrosexual

The girls go round and round
The boys go round and round
If the world goes round and round
We all go round and round
The girls go round and round
The boys go round and round
If the world goes round and round
We all go round and round
What do you saw? Get outta here kid!

Shake your head cause she wants to
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming off the girls names
Feel so retrosexual (sexual)
Feel so retrosexual, sexual, sexual, sexual
Sexual
