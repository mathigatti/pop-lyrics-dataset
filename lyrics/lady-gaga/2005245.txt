Last week I saw you out,
and I knew we would be
a match in heaven.
Just the coolest kind of team.


I,I know there ain't no
way that we won't.
Cuz we won't stop 'til we
go, go the distance.
We're a this team
Baby I believe it.

I still believe it.
And you know, won't be defeated.
In my heart, I believe it.
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby.

I'm gonna take you out,
take you out, take you out.
We're gonna show this town
what I know we're about.
Shoot it, run it, what's it called?
Everybody loves it. Football!
