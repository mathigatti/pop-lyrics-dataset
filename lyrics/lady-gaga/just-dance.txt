I'm red one
Konvict
Gaga ohoh ehh


I've had a little bit too much much
All of the people start to rush, start to rush by
How does he twist a dance, can't find my drink oh man
Where are my keys, I lost my phone phone

What's go-ing on on the floor?
I love this record baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool what's the name of this club
I can't remember but it's alright alright

Just dance gonna be ok da da doo doo mm
Just dance spin that record babe da da doo doo mm
Just dance gonna be ok d d d dance
Dance dance just j-j-just dance

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth.
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? Inside outright.
Control your poison babe
Roses have thorns they say.
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight.

What's go-ing on on the floor?
