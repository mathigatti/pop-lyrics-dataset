I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've gotta go away
Baby, it's cold out there
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice


My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Just listen to that fireplace roar
Now really I'd better scurry
Sweetheart, what's your hurry?
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Why don't you put some records on while I pour?

The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I oughta say 'no, no, no sir'
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out!
Oh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
But baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been
So lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out that window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Ooh, baby you're so delicious
Maybe just one little kiss more
Never such a blizzard before

Oh, I gotta go home
You'll freeze to the bone out there
Hey, lend me your coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Making my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old out
Baby, it's cold outside

It is kinda chilly
Just stay right here baby
You ain't gotta be nowhere
All right, you win, ha ha ha
