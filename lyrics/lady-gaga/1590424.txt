Where is it?
Where is it candy?


He ate it

Yes, i don't believe you

Look for yourself
Pop ate my heart

I see

He downed the whole thing
in one efficient gulp
like a beautiful monster
and took off into the city

Oh candy

and now i just feel...
i feel so...

Empty?

no... no...

Candy?

Free... I feel free

I need more to feed my pop heart
Give me more
I want: The future, Gaga, Fashion, Technology
Dance, New York, more music, POP CULTURE
I want... The Fame
I can hear you...
Can you hear me?
Revolution is coming
and I want...
We want...
You deserve...
... The Future

My name is...
Lady Gaga
And this is my... Haus
