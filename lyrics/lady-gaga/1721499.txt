I wanna hold em' like they do in Texas plays
Fold em' let em' hit me raise it baby stay with me
Lovegame intuition play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got...

Can't read my,
Can't read my,
No he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody

Can't read my,
Can't read my,
No he can't read my poker face
He's got me like nobody

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
* snap snap
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
* snap snap

I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be
A little gambling, a little, is fun when you're with me
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love if it's not rough it isn't fun

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, o-oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got...

Yeah!

Can't read my,
Can't read my,
No he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody

Can't read my,
Can't read my,
No he can't read my poker face
He's got me like nobody

I won't... tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying I'm just... stunnin' with my love-glue-gunning
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand cause I am marvelous

I'm marvelous
I'm marvelous
I'm marvelous

So marvelous

He can't read my,
He can't read my...

Poker face
