My body is a sanctuary, my blood is pure
You want me bad, I think you're cool
But I'm not sure


Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something more from you
It's not about sex or champagne, you holy fool

If you want me, meet me at electric chapel
If you want me, meet me at electric chapel
If you want to steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place
Come on, meet me in electric chapel

Confess to me where you have been (next to the bar)
Pray for your sins, Right under the glass disco ball

Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something sacred from you
Together we'll both find a way to make pure love work in a dirty way

If you want me, meet me at electric chapel
If you want me, meet me at electric chapel
If you want to steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place
Come on, meet me in electric chapel

If you want me, meet me at electric chapel
If you want me, meet me at electric chapel
If you want to steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place
Come on, meet me in electric chapel

Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
