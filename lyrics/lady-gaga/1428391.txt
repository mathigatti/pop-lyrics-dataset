I never ever thought I'd live away
From everybody I love and say goodbye
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train
Where everybody here, they know my game
But when I walk down the street I hear them say
"There she goes, that crazy girl
She thinks she's something in this world"


So I just close my eyes and dream yeah
'Cause life is never really what it seems
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm tellin', I'm tellin'

No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town

In a world unknown
You've gotta hold your own
You can't stop me
You're never ever ever gonna stop me now

On every street there is a memory
A time and place where we can never be again
Street lights glow green, red, and yellow too
Do you let signs tell you what to do?
'Cause yeah, when you say stop
Be sure that I'll say go
To the stars in the land
Fire can't burn these hands

No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town

In a world unknown
You've gotta hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never ever ever gonna stop me now

Go ahead and don't believe
But everyone needs a way to breath
And love and dream and you can't stop me
You can't stop me

No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town

In a world unknown
You've gotta hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never ever ever gonna stop me now

I never ever thought I'd live away
From everybody I love and say goodbye
