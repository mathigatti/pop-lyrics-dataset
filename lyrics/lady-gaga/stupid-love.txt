You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this crying, nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me


Freak out, I freak out, I freak out, I freak out (look at me)
I get down, I get down, I get down, I get down (look at me)
Freak out, I freak out, I freak out, I freak out
Look at me now

'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey, hey-uh (ooh-ooh)
Hey, hey-uh (ooh-ooh)
Hey, hey-uh
All I ever wanted was love
Hey, hey-uh (ooh-ooh)
Hey, hey-uh (ooh-ooh)
Hey, hey-uh (higher, higher)

I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Now it's time to free me from the  shame
I gotta find that peace, is it too late
Or could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you (even if I break in two)

Freak out, I freak out, I freak out, I freak out (look at me)
I get down, I get down, I get down, I get down (look at me)
Freak out, I freak out, I freak out, I freak out
Look at me now

'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey, hey-uh (ooh-ooh)
Hey, hey-uh (ooh-ooh)
Hey, hey-uh
All I ever wanted was love
Hey, hey-uh (ooh-ooh)
Hey, hey-uh (ooh-ooh)
Hey, hey-uh (higher, higher)

I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

I don't need a reason (oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
I don't need a reason (oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
Higher, higher

I want your stupid love, love (oh, oh, woo)
We got a stupid love, love (love, love, uh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I want your stupid love, love
