Marilyn, Judy, S-Sylvia, Tell 'em how you feel girls
Work your JonBen√©t Ramsey, we'll haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick

You will never fall apart Diana, you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Togeter want together, want together, want together
Want together, want together, want together
Want together, want together, want together
Want together

I'm free bitch
I'm free bitch
