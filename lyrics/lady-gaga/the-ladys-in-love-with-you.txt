If there’s a gleam in her eye
Each time she straightens your tie
That means the lady’s in love with you
And if she can’t dress for a date
Without that waiting you hate


That means the lady’s in love with you
And when your friends ask you over to join the table
But she will find that far away booth for two
Well jack, here’s just how it stands

You’ve got romance on your hands
Because the lady’s in love with you
