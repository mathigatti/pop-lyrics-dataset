Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I’ll undress you
Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you


A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could
We could belong together
ARTPOP
We could
We could belong together
ARTPOP
We could
We could belong together
ARTPOP
ARTPOP
ARTPOP

Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue
Lovers’ kites
Are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose
Can profit you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything
Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could
We could belong together
ARTPOP
We could
We could belong together
ARTPOP
We could
We could belong together
ARTPOP
ARTPOP
ARTPOP

Brushes with darkness won’t help you create your destiny of self
But ARTPOP could mean anything
Anything
I try to sell myself
But I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
Music not the bling

We could
We could belong together
ARTPOP
We could
We could belong together
ARTPOP
We could
We could belong together
ARTPOP
ARTPOP
ARTPOP

We could
Wecould belong together
ARTPOP
We could
We could belong together
ARTPOP
We could
We could belong together
ARTPOP
ARTPOP
ARTPOP

Free my mind, ARTPOP
You make my heart stop
