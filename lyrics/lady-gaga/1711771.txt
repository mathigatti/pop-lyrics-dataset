There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, "seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind


Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me (2x)
