Yeah, man, play that New York drum, Homer
Show 'em how we do it
Downtown


Just another way to prove I love you
And it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say
That makes me mad
I'll turn away, I'll turn away, I'll turn away

And think of different ways
To keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours
With playful, joyous thoughts

We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey, I love you
And after all
It's just another day

Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet

And pick up unique style
I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts
I'll laugh in humble ways

We both know I could learn a thing or two
About behaving, but I love you
And after all
It's just another day

(Come on, Mark)

(Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Newman)

We both know I could learn a thing or two
About behaving, but I love you
And after all
It's just another day

And after all
It's just another day
