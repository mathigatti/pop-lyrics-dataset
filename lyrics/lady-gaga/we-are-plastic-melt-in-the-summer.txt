We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique


Here we go, 'round on the boulevard
Top, cut that cake, till my sugar flow stop
(Yeah, it don't stop)
Don't stop
(It's a record)
Drip, drip, drip, baby watch me melt
T-take a sip, sip, sip, but it doesn't help me stop
(Yeah, it don't stop)
Can't stop
(It's a record)

Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of the summer
Don't say that you need me
In the middle of the summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in a blender
Yeah, baby, we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer
Melt in the summer

We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique

Wire that girl for the electronic
Underground scene where the beat is chronic, yeah
(We are plastic, ooh, nous sommes plastique)
Oh yeah
(We are plastic, ooh, nous sommes plastique)
Drip, drip, drip, baby watch me melt
T-take a sip, sip, sip, but it doesn't help, it's bad
(Yeah, it don't stop)
So bad
(It's a record)

Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of the summer
Don't say that you need me
In the middle of the summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in a blender
Yeah, baby, we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer
Melt in the summer

We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique

We got a synthetic situation
And we dance with no intermission
Mister, shouldn't kissed her
Before the rockshow was oh-oh-over
Here we go-go, sir
We're making time, it's a record, record, record

Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of the summer
Don't say that you need me
In the middle of the summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in a blender
Yeah, baby, we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer
Melt in the summer

(Melt in the summer)
We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique
(Melt in the summer)
We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique
(Melt in the summer)
We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique
(Melt in the summer)
We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique
(Melt in the summer)
