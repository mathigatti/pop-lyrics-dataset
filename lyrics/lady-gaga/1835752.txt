I'm gonna marry the night
I won't give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen
Live passionately tonight


I'm gonna marry the dark
Gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness
I am a winner

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night
Gonna marry the night

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothin' on these streets to explore

Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

I'm gonna lace up my boots
Throw on some leather and cruise
Down the street that I love
In my fishnet gloves
I'm a sinner

Then I'll go down to the bar
But I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high
Kiss the bartender twice
I'm a loser

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothin' on these streets to explore

Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

Nothing's too cool
To take me from you
New York is not just a tan that you'll never loose
Love is the new Denim or black
Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic

Get Ginger ready
Climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seats with my heels
Cuz that's where we make love

Come on and runnnnnn
Turn the car on and runnnnnn

I'm gonna marry the night
We're gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothin' on these streets to explode

Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

I'm gonna marry
Marry
I'm gonna marry
Marry
C'mon, c'mon
The night, the night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night, the night
The night
