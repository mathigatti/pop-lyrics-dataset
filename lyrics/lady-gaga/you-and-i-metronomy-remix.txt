Yoü and I, yoü
Yoü, yoü and I, yoü, baby
Yoü, yoü and I, yoü, baby
Yoü, yoü and I, yoü, baby


It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leavin' without you

You taste like whiskey when yoü kiss me awe
I'd give anything again to be your babydoll
This time I'm not leaving without you

He said, sit back down where yoü belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and yoü said to me

Somethin', somethin' about this place
Somethin' 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah somethin' about, baby, yoü and I

Yoü and I, yoü
Yoü, yoü and I, yoü
Yoü, yoü and I, yoü
Yoü, yoü and I, yoü, baby

It's been two years since I let yoü go
I couldn't listen to a joke or rock n'roll
And muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart

On my birthday yoü sang me "Heart Of Gold"
With a guitar hummin' and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without yoü

Sit back down where yoü belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and yoü said to me

Somethin', somethin' about this place
Somethin' 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah somethin' about, baby, yoü and I

(Yoü and I
Yoü yoü and I)
Yoü and I
Yoü yoü and I
Yoü yoü and I
Yoü yoü and I

Yoü and I
Yoü yoü and I
Oh yeah I'd rather die, without yoü and I

(Baby, yoü and I)
(Baby, yoü and I)
(Baby, yoü and I)
(Baby, yoü and I)

(Baby, yoü and I)
(Baby, yoü and I)
(Baby, yoü and I)
(Baby, yoü and I)
