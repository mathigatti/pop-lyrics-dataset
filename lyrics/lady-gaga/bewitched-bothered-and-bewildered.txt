After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo Seltzer handy
I don't even shake


Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well, I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

But I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
I could not sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Oh, I lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold, I agree
They can laugh, but I love him
And so the laugh's on me
I'll sing to him, bring springs, to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it?
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it?
Like a babe in arms

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
