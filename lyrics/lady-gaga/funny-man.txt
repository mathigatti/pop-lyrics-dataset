How, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how
How, how, how
How can you sit there and watch me scream?
Oh you're my funny man
How, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how
How, how, how
How can you sit there and watch me scream?


Ooh you're my funny man
You think it's funny to play with me
Do you think it's safe baby?
Wait and see
My heart is not to be played with
I am waiting a long time to say this

I love you, I need you, I want you oh so bad
I wish that I could forget the secrets that we've had
I'm dying, I'm crying, that you're laughing like it's funny
What's funny? What's funny? Lady Gaga is no dummy
How, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how
How, how, how
How can you sit there and watch me scream?
Oh you're my funny man

I can see what we had back then wasn't real
You wear a disguise just to see how we feel
You took my heart and, mamed it
So hard too forget it
I love you, I need you, I want you oh so bad.
I wish that I could forget the secrets that we've had.
I'm dying, I'm crying, that you're laughing like it's funny.
What's funny? What's funny? Lady Gaga is no dummy.

How, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how
How, how, how
How can you sit there and watch me scream?
Oh you're my funny man
I want you to know, that it hurts to hear you laughing.
I wouldn't do that to you.
You stole my heart, you wrecked my soul.
Now tell me, what's so funny?

How, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how
How, how, how
How can you sit there and watch me scream?
Oh, you're my funny man
I love you, I need you, I want you oh so bad
I wish that I could forget the secrets that we've had
I'm dying, I'm crying, that you're laughing like it's funny
What's funny? What's funny? Lady gaga is no dummy

How, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how
How, how, how
How can you sit there and watch me scream?
Oh, you're my funny man
How, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how
How, how, how
