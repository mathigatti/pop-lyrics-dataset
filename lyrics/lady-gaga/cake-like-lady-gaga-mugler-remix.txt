Stuntin' all day
Swag on one hundred million
Private plane, like Lady Gaga
Sip champagne, like Lady Gaga
Sold-out show, like Lady Gaga
Big bank-roll, like Lady Gaga
Iced-out wrist
Iced-out chain


I’m deep up in the fucking game
Everybody knows my name
Diamond ring, like Lady Gaga
Diamond ring in your face
Fuck your face, trick bitch
Fuck your life, trick bitch
I’m shaked up and I’ll fuck your wife
Fuck your life you bitch ass trick

I’m posted in the trap
Strapped with an AK
Aiming at your fitted cap
Cake like Lady Gaga
Cake like Lady Gaga
Cake like Lady Gaga
Cake like Lady Gaga

You rollin’ on that Reggie Bush
I roll like Lady Gaga
Lady Gaga in this bitch
I roll all fucking day
Donatella on your hoes
Donatella, got them clothes
Donatella, dat's fo'sho
Chop her in the chopper
On a way to a sold-out show
Lady Gaga bitch ass trick
I put that on my Papa Joe
I mop you all across the floor
Snatch a fucking weave out, bitch
In front of paparazzi, singing Paparazzi in this bitch

Twitter on thirty million
Under thirty, hundred million
Thirty million fans
Straight fanning, like my children, chiling
Ask my man, Hedi at Yves about EMI
Ask anybody, I’m rich
Homie I got plenty
Shut you down, like Lady Gaga
Iced-out crown and Miuccia Prada
I son you son
Ask your father
Spell tattoo I hate your daughter

Ayo, I’m Lady Gaga
You know I’m Lady Gaga
Laser cut up, ladder mesh
Mugler show, I’m Lady Gaga
Bad bitches gonna walk the runway
Walk bitches, like Lady Gaga
Ortenberg, you can suck my dick
Walk bitch, you ain't Lady Gaga
Nicopanda got style, trick
Cathy Horyn, your style ain't dick
Walk a mile in these foot high heels
I run in these, you ain't running shit
You chew beef, I wear meat and stay on top
I’m gettin’ fat and so is my bank
I’m on a sold out world tour bitch
