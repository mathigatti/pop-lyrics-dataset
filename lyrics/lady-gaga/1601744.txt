Baby you've got a lot of questions
You better listen up please
I wanna know what you want and need
To charge up your batteries
You got the flow and the intention
Boy but have you got (stop) the mouth
Show me that you've got the ammunition
That you're good for a while, for a while, for a while


Charge it up because ba-by you could be mine
I don't need a red soldier
I need you to reload it
Bring it reloaded
Charge it up cause babe you're one of a kind
I don't need a red soldier
I need you to reload it
Bring it reloaded

You better reserve yourself
Cause tonight I'm expecting to get plenty
And I wont do it myself
Conserve your juices cause I'm gonna
Take you on a (miracle?)

Who like's a man who can't go wrong

Charge it up because baby you could be mine

Bring it reloaded
Charge it up cause babe you're one of a kind
I don't need a red soldier
