Don't wanna let this moment slip away
Cause I-I have something that I really need to say
And it's killing me inside
I think that you don't understand
How I-I would give you all I have and all I am
Till the end of time


You got me defenseless, intoxicated senseless
You cut me so deeply, I must confess

Baby I can't breath, when my arms around you
Baby it kills me cause now that I found you
Your love is like a weapon girl, I can't live without you
You're so beautiful, it's tearing me apart
You murder my heart (oh)
You murder my heart (oh girl)

I need to catch my breathe with you sometimes
Cause I-I get dizzy when your body's touching mine
Girl you're killing me inside
The way you move is much too sexy baby
So I-I surrender to your hands, your lips, your taste
And I'm telling you tonight

You got me defenseless, intoxicated senseless
You cut me so deeply, I must confess

Baby I can't breath, when my arms around you
Baby it kills me cause now that I found you
Your love is like a weapon girl, I can't live without you
You're so beautiful, it's tearing me apart
You murder my heart (oh)
You murder my heart (oh girl)

I climb up the past that I could never escape
Girl you hurt me and changed from the start
I'm just a witness to the scene of my heart
And the way you've been slaying my heart

Baby I can't breath when my arms around you
Baby it kills me cause now that I found you
Your love is like a weapon girl, I can't live without you
You're so beautiful, it's tearing me apart
You murder my heart (oh)
You murder my heart (oh girl)
You murder my heart (oh)
You murder my heart (tears me apart)
You murder my heart (girl)
You murder my heart (oh girl)
