One look and I'm done
One glance from your eyes and I'm captivated
The taste of your skin
The warmth of your hungry lips has me so taken


And I love the way you can make me dance
From miles away
When I'm with you I'm so sedated
I'm captivated by you.

You're just like the wind
Cause everything moves when you're around
The sun is just like the sound of your voice in the morning
When you light my world up

And I love the way you can make me dance
From miles away
When I'm with you I'm never jaded
I'm captivated

I'll never stop believing
In this crazy love we're leading
Sugar, hold me close and make me sweeter
I need you, I love you

So please show me that smile
Make me laugh for just a little while
Then breathe me one breath
I only need one to fill the emptiness

And I love the way you can make me dance
From miles away
It's been so long but now I've waited
And now I'm captivated
