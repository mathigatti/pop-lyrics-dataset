Silicone, saline, poison inject me
Baby I'm a free bitch
I'm a free bitch


Some girls won't dance
To the beat of the track
She won't walk away
But she won't look back
She looks good
But her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess, she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess
(Tellem', girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz' when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
(Tellem', girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves dance in the dark
(Tellem', girls)

Run, run, her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way
While she's howlin' at him
She looks good
But her boyfriend says shes a tramp
She's a tramp, she's a vamp
But she still does her dance
She's a tramp, she's a vamp
But she still kills the dance
(Tellem', girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz' when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
(Tellem', girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz' when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
(Tellem', girls)

In the dark
She loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
She love, she loves to dance in the dark

Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia
Tellem' how you feel girls!
Work your blonde Benet Ramsey
We'll haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick
You will never fall apart
Diana you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz' when he's looking
She falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz' when he's looking
She falls apart
Baby loves to dance
Loves to dance in the dark
(Dance in the dark)
