Hold her hand through the black light
Baby it's a forest land of trick slides
Honey just take your time. Close her eyes
"I'm scared," she whispered as she wants to hide
Into a back room where she paints on a smile
She hears a sound. She hears a sound


It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, oh oh
She waited for love
But there wasn't anybody
Around so she left town with the rock show

Keep it cool at the freakshow
Baby its a happy place if you lose it, honey
Just take your time. Close his eyes
"Touch me," he whispered as he walks to the light
From the window, there's visions of a house in the night
He hears a sound. He hears a sound

It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, oh oh
He waited for love
But there wasn't anybody
Around so he left town with the rock show

Hold her, tell her that you need her
Please undress her slowly, oh oh
Never hold the girl too tightly
She can't breathe when you speak, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
We waited for love
But there wasn't anybody
Around so we left town with the rock show, rock show, rock show, rock show
