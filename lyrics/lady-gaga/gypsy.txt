Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"Cuz I’m a wanderin' man", he said to me
"And what about our future plans?
Does this thing we have even make sense
When I got the whole world in front of me?"
So I said


I don’t wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don’t wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don’t wanna be alone forever
Maybe we could see the world together
I don’t wanna be alone forever
But I can be
Tonight
Tonight

So I just packed my baggage and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cuz I left everyone I love at home

And I dont wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we could see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be
Tonight
Tonight

'Cuz I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

And then he asked me, he said
”Baby, why do we love each other?”
I said “Honey, it's simple
it’s the way that you love and treat your mother”
Thought that I would be alone forever
But I won’t be tonight
I’m a man without a home
But I think with you I could spend my life
And you’ll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rear view and fire up the jets
'Cuz it’s you and me

Baby, for life
If you go with me
For life
See the world with me

'Cuz I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

Russia, UK, Paris
I'm Italian, Asia combined
Africa, India
I’m gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
I'm Latin American
I dont speak German, but I try
Some day in Jakarta, I’m American
I’m gypsy
I’m Bangkok, Australia
Malasia, Sweden
Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I’m a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, hey
