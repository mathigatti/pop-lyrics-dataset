Want to
I think I love you
You got ripped jeans
I'm only 19
What do you wanna do?


You got your cigarette
I got my headset
We're two of a kind
You're spades and I'm diamonds
And you know that too

Yeah you can see clearly
That I am the one you want
But I must admit that
I'm everything you're not

Yeah I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I cut lines, you wait you turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Don't shoot
My heart is on mute
Our physical dream
Is only skin deep
How do you wanna groove?

Bang Bang
Should hear my gun ring
You're mine, you're there
You'll hear that
I am all up inside your head

Now you can see clearly
That I am the one you want
But I must admit that
I'm everything you're not

Yeah I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I cut lines, you wait your turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

You won't forget me when I'm gone
This feels so good, it can't be wrong
I recommend a one night stand
I know we're just friends
But you're my kind of man
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
Just for tonight

Even know I'm red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
I know we could be great for tonight
When you're cold, I'll make it burn
You'll never have to wait your turn
Yeah I guess I could forgive you tonight

Yeah I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I cut lines, you wait your turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
