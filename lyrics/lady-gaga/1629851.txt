Blueberry kisses,
My lips they miss his, oh yeah
Where did you go now?
Where did you go?
Blueberry kisses.


I told you baby,
I'd love you, maybe,
But you stopped the clock the second time around.

I need you around (blueberry kisses)
I need you around (blueberry kisses)
I need you around (blueberry kisses)
(Round and round, round and round and round)

Blueberry kisses,
The muffin man, he misses them kisses, yeah.
Where did they go now?
Where did you go?
Blueberry kisses.

I told you baby,
I'd l-o-v you, maybe,
But you stopped the clock the second time around.

You know it's crazy,

But I've been feeling lately,
That I need you around

I need you around (blueberry kisses)
I need you around (blueberry kisses)
I need you around (blueberry kisses)
