Oh oh, oh oh oh!
Your super lover
Oh oh, oh oh, oh!
Your super lover


Black lights and designer blues
With my tattoos of I Love You's
I just put on these dancing shoes
To prove my love for you

I'm livin' it up
Secretly he notices I'm playin' it up
For him
Playin' it up
I'm livin' it up
Dancin' on the tables as the DJ's
Spinnin' it up
For me
Spinnin' it up
For me

When the sun goes down
And the curtain's up
It's time for the show-oh-oh-oh
They new to the scene
Make way for the queen
I'm on a roll-oh-oh-oh
Stare in my direction
Craving your affection
So now

Go back to the beat
Get up on your feet
Gonna be your super lover
Right back to the beat
Get up on your feet
I'ma be your super lover
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh!
Your super lover
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh!
Your super lover

Too hot for the masses
She's on fire
Think I'm gonna let her burn
Champagne in the glasses
Flip the bottle, baby
Come on take your turn
She's on my radar
Catch ya later
Cause she knows
When I push the fader
She aint leaving me alone

Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

I'm livin' it up
Dancin' on the tables
Mister DJ spinning it up
With you, spinning it up
With you

When the sun goes down
And the curtain's up
It's time for the show-oh-oh-oh
They new to the scene
Make way for the queen
I'm on a roll-oh-oh-oh
Stare in my direction
I'm craving your affection
So now

Go back to the beat
Get up on your feet
Gonna be your super lover
Right back to the beat
Get up on your feet
I'ma be your super lover

Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh!
Your super lover
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh!
Your super lover

(C'mon, say it)
Eh, eh, eh!
Look at that girl
Look at that girl
Look at that--eh, eh, eh!
Look at that girl
Look at that girl
Hold up, hold up
Take me where you get to know them
Hold up, hold up
Cause they're tryna get my clothes off

When the sun goes down
And the curtain's up
It's time for the show-oh-oh-oh
They new to the scene
Make way for the queen
I'm on a roll-oh-oh-oh
Stare in my direction
Craving your affection
So now

Go back to the beat
Get up on your feet
Gonna be your super lover
Right back to the beat
Get up on your feet
I'ma be your super lover

Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh!
Your super lover (oh oh, oh oh-oh)
