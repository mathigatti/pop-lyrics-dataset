I was twenty-three
She was thirty-five
I was spiralling out
And she was so alive


A Texas girl real strong
Taught me this strong song
So when I start to bawl
She says: Let your teardrops fall

All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world

Uoh, uoh, make it all make sense
Uoh, uoh, does it all make sense?
Uoh, uoh, make it all make sense

Sisters never pack up
We always run back love
Seven years ago
I said you'd make it so

Sonja was Joanne's friend
Tough girls on the mend
So when I'm feeling small
I toss that cork and call

All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world

Uoh, uoh, make it all make sense
Uoh, uoh, make it all make sense
Uoh, uoh, does it all make sense?

So we'll turn on a bachelorette
Dye Ashley's hair red
And then we'll have our sixth
Spice girl in this bitch

All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world

All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Gather 'round now
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world
