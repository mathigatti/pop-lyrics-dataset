Love is funny or it's sad
Or it's quit or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad


But beautiful
Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all
Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's a play
It's heartache either way

But beautiful
And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go
And that would be
But beautiful
I know
Love is beautifull
I know
