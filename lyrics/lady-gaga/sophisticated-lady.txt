They say into your early life romance came
And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away
Then, with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise
The years have changed you, somehow
I see you now


Smoking, drinking
Never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining
Dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want?
Oh no, sophisticated lady
I know, you miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh, you cry

Smoking, drinking
Never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant

Oh no, sophisticated lady
I know, you miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh
When nobody is nigh
Nobody is nigh, you cry
