Quicksand
I still see your coat hangin' on the door
Never let anybody put one there before
My pillow's got your head printed on it
Baby, of all the guys you were my favorite


Don't ask me why
I just can't say goodbye
No not tonight
No, I just can't say it

'Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holding on to what we had
'Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby 'cause you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby 'cause you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby like quicksand
Baby 'cause you and me are sinking like quicksand

You came along I didn't know of love
But now I know that sometimes it's just not enough
I hear your footsteps in my corridor
But it is just my heart, it's pounding like before

Wish I, could try
But I just can't say goodbye
No not, tonight
No, I just can't say it

'Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holding on to what we had
'Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby 'cause you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby 'cause you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby like quicksand
Baby 'cause you and me are sinking like quicksand

'Cause the ground is breaking
I can feel it shaking
Wish it was that easy
But it's not that easy
Gotta hold my hands up
Gotta keep my head up
Gotta keep on breathing
Baby even if we're sinking
Even if we're sinking
Baby even if we're sinking
Even if we are sinking
'Cause I just-just gotta-gotta hold

'Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holding on to what we had
'Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby 'cause you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, like quicksand

Only got one life to hold on
We don't even need to be so strong
Only you and me, we need to hold on and hold on and
Only got one life to hold on
We don't even need to be so strong
Only you and me, we need to hold on and hold on and hold on
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
(Baby 'cause you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, like quicksand)
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
(Baby 'cause you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, like quicksand)
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
(Baby 'cause you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, like quicksand)
