Wait, I think it's time
Your fire's lit and so is mine
Go turn out the light
Don't be afraid, tonight's the night


And I won't, I won't try to change you
But I will, I will if I want to
Yeah, it always brings me down
When you're not around
I still need you

Oh, You do something for me baby
I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, You do something crazy to me
I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me

And I feel so down
When you're not around

Boy, we're almost there
I'll lay your clothes over my chair
Pull the shades down low
We're both ready so lose control

And I won't, I won't try to tame you
But I will, I will if you want to
Yeah it always brings me down
When you're not around
I still need you

Oh, You do something for me baby
I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, You do something crazy to me
I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me

And I feel so down
When you're not around

And I won't, I won't try to tame you
But I will, I will if you want to
Yeah it always brings me down
When you're not around
I still need you

Oh, You do something for me baby
I cannot control it lately
You do something for me
Oh, You do something for me baby
I cannot control it lately
You do something for me

Oh, You do something crazy to me
I cannot control it, baby
La la la la la la la la
You always bring me down
