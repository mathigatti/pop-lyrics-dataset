Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick


Huh! Huh!

I wanna kiss you (huh!)
But if I do then I might miss you, babe (huh!)
It's complicated and stupid (huh!)
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play (huh!)
A LoveGame, a LoveGame (huh!)

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (huh!)
Dans, the LoveGame
Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame (huh!)
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (huh!)
Dans, the LoveGame

Huh! Huh!

I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A LoveGame, a LoveGame

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick (huh!)
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick (huh!)

Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (huh!)
Dans, the LoveGame
Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame (huh!)
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (huh!)
Dans, the LoveGame

Huh! Huh!

I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your, huh!
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a huh! and a game

And a game! (huh!)
And a game! (huh!)
And a game! (huh!)
A LoveGame!

Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (huh!)
Dans, the LoveGame
Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame (huh!)
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (huh!)
Dans, the LoveGame (huh!)

Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (huh!)
(Let's have some fun, this beat is sick)
Dans, the LoveGame
(I wanna take a ride on your disco stick)
Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame (huh!)
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (huh!)
(Don't think too much, just bust that kick)
Dans, the LoveGame (huh!)
(I wanna take a ride on your disco stick)
Dans, the LoveGame (huh!)
