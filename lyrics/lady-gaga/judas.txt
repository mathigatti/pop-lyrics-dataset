I claim to

Oh oh oh oh oh oh I'm in love with Judas, Judas, Judas
Oh oh oh oh oh oh I'm in love with Judas, Judas, Judas


Gaga

When he comes to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me

I'll bring him down
Bring him down, down, down

Oh oh oh oh oh oh I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh oh oh oh oh I'm in love with Judas, Judas

Judas

I couldn't love a man so purely
Even darkness forgave his crooked way
I've learned love is like a brick, you can
Build a house or sink a dead body

A king with no crown
A king with no crown

Oh oh oh oh oh oh I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh oh oh oh oh I'm in love with Judas, Judas

I wanna love you but something is putting me away from you
Jesus is my virtue and Judas is the demon I claim to
