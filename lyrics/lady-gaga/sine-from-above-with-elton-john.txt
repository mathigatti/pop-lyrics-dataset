When I was young, I prayed for lightning
My mother said it would come and find me
I found myself without a prayer
I lost my love and no one cared
When I was young, I prayed for lightning


Yeah, I looked with my face up to the sky
But I saw nothing there, no, no, nothing there
Yeah, I stared while my eyes filled up with tears
But there was nothing there, no, no, nothing

I heard one sine from above (oh)
I heard one sine from above (oh)
Then the signal split in two
The sound created stars like me and you
Before there was love, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine

Healed my heart, heard a sine
Healed my heart, heard a sine

When I was young, I felt immortal
And not a day went by without a struggle
I lived my days just for the nights
I lost myself under the lights
When I was young, I felt immortal

Yeah, I looked with my face up to the sky
But I saw nothing there, no, no, nothing there
Yeah, I stared while my eyes filled up with tears
But there was nothing there, no, no nothing

I heard one sine from above (oh)
I heard one sine from above (oh)
Then the signal split in two
The sound created stars like me and you
Before there was love, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine

Healed my heart, heard a sine
Healed my heart, heard a sine

Then the signal split in two
The sound created stars like me and you
Before there was love, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine

Healed my heart
Healed my
Heart, heard a sine
Healed my
Heart, heard a sine
