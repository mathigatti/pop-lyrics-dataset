You tell me it gets better, it gets better in time
You say I'll pull myself together
Pull it together, you'll be fine
Tell me, what the hell do you know? What do you know?
Tell me how the hell could you know? How could you know?


'Til It happens to you
You don't know how it feels, how it feels
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real
No, it won't be real, won't know how it feels

You tell me hold your head up
Hold your head up and be strong
'Cause when you fall you gotta get up
You gotta get up and move on
Tell me how the hell could you talk, how could you talk?
'Cause until you walk where I walk
This is no joke

'Til it happens to you
You don't know how it feels, how it feels
'Til it happens to you
You won't know, it won't be real
(How could you know?)
No it won't be real
(How could you know?)
Won't know how I feel

'Til your world burns and crashes
'Til you're at the end, the end of your rope
'Til you're standing in my shoes
I don't wanna hear a thing from you, from you, from you
'Cause you don't know

'Til it happens to you
You don't know how I feel, how I feel
'Til it happens to you
You won't know, it won't be real
(How could you know?)
No it won't be real
(How could you know?)
Won't know how it feels

Til it happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
(How could you know?)
Til it happens to you
You won't know how I feel
