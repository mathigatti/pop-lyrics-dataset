Now the hope for the future took a pounding in the parking lot
And the answer for today is all I got
When your name is called the lights went down
The time is the essence excuse me
And I'm blinking at the vanishing point of what I thought


Staring down the barrel of the middle distance
God knows I've tried
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

I greet despair to a standard prayer
If you call for the future I don't care
And I turn you round to face me here
There's a compass raised with a familiar tone
With a voice that needles me to the bone

Staring down the barrel of the middle distance
God knows I've tried
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

Whose position shifts cause its been effect
If you can't hit play cause the button sticks
Ignorance is bliss, I can't say
There's a compass raised with familiar tone
With a voice that needles you to the bone
You're left with chaos, static and delay

Staring down the barrel of the middle distance
Staring down the barrel of the middle distance
God knows I've tried
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

Staring down the barrel of the middle distance
God knows I've tried
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
