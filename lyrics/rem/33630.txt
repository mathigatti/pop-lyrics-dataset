You're moving through rough waters
Motor boy
And swimming in your sleep
How could I be so blind, mis-sighted
Not to see there's something wounded deep
Anyone could scratch your surface now
It's all amphetamine
You're blasting yourself into the present
To blur some past indignity, say that


You say that
You hate it
You want to re-create it

I've been around, I've been your lover
I let it go, kill devil hills
You're coming onto something so fast, so numb
That you can't even feel

You're drinking raw adrenal baby
And dosey dosey doe
You're eating cartilage, shark-eyes, shark-heart
All present tense
Boy, your blood is running cold
Listen: This is now, this is here
This is me, this is what I wanted
You to see
That was then, that was that
That is gone, that is past
You cast yourself, cast
Passed by, thrown down fast, you say

You say that
You hate it
But you want to recreate it

I've played this round, I've played your lover
I've played it out and to the hilt
You're coming onto something so fast, so numb
That you can't even feel

You love it
You hate it
You want to re-create it
Now this is here, this is me
This is what I wanted
You to see
That was then, that was that
That is gone, that is what
I wanted you to feel

You love it
You hate it
I'm spitting out the bitter pill

I've been around, I've been your lover
I let it go, kill devil hills
You're coming onto something so fast, so numb
That you can't even feel

I've played this round, I've played your lover
I've played it out and to the hilt
You're coming onto something so fast, so numb
That you can't even feel

You've played around, you played me lover
I let it go, kill devil hills
You're moving so hard, so fast, so numb
That you can't even feel
