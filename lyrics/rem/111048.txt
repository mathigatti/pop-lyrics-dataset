You threw away the ballast and you rowed your boat ashore
Didn't you, now? Didn't you?
You made your ultimatum too big to ignore
Didn't you, now? Didn't you?


So you worked out your excuses, 
turned away and shut the door.
The world's too vast for us now, 
and you wanted to explore 

It's a long, long long road
And I don't know which way to go
If you offered me your hand again I'd have to walk away.

When I saw you at the street fair, you called out my name
Didn't you, now? Didn't you? 
You said we could start over, try and make it all okay.
Didn't you, now? Didn't you?

So our past has been rewritten 
and you threw away the pen.
You'd said that I was useless, 
but now you'll take me in again

Well Jesus loves me fine.
And your words fall flat this time.

Was it my imagination, or did I hear you say,
"We don't have a prayer between us."

Didn't you believe that I have finally turned away?
Didn't you, now? Didn't you?
Anything to hold onto to help me through my day.
Didn't you, now? Didn't you?

Jesus loves me fine.
But his words fall flat this time.

It's a long, long long road
And I don't know which way to go
If you offered me your world, did you think I'd really stay?
If you offered me the heavens, I would have to turn away.
Was it my imagination, or did I hear you say,
"We don't have a prayer between us." 
Didn't you, now? Didn't you, now?
Didn't you?
