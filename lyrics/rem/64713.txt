I know what I wanted.
I know what I wanted.
I know how I wanted this to be.
you go down to the water,
drink down of the water,
walk up off the water, 
leave it be.
This is not my dream, sister
it is cold in heaven.
and I'm not sprouting wings.


I'm turning, me.
I'm drowning, me.

brother, can you see those birds?
they don't look to heaven.
they don't need religion, 
they can see.
they go down to the water,
drink down of the water,
fly up off the water, 
leave it be
This is not my time, sister
It is cold in heaven.
but no-one's coming after me.

I'm drowning, me.
I'm drowning, me.

you know I am tired.
cold and bony tired.
nothing is going to save me,
I can see.
I can't say I'm fearful.
I can't say I'm not afraid.
I am not resisting, 
I can see.
That I don't need a heaven.
I don't need religion.
I am in the place where I should be.
I am breathing water.
I am breathing water.
you know a body's got to breathe.

I'm drowning, me.
I'm drowning, me.
