Now I'm not feeding off you, I will rearrange your scales
If I can, and I can
March into the ocean, march into the sea


I had a hat I put it down and it sunk, reached down,
yanked it up, slapped it on my head
All the people gather
Fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years we are concern
We are hope despite the times
All of the sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever....

I wish to meet each one of you
And you, me, you, if I can and I can
We have many things in common, name three (three, three, three)

I had a hat and it sunk, reached down,
yanked it up, slapped it on my head
All the people gather
Fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years we are concern
We are hope despite the times
All of the sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you go.

Now I'm not feeding off you I will rearrange your scales
If I can and I can
I wish to eat each one of you and you, me, you

I had a hat and it sunk, reached down,
yanked it up, slapped it on my head
All the people gather
Fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years we are concern
We are hope despite the times
All of the sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you...
carry each his burden
We are young despite the years we are concern
We are hope despite the times
All of the sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you go.
(Take away the scattered bones of my meal)
