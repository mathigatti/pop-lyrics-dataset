I've been lost
Inside my head
Echoes fall out of me
I took
The price last night
For complicated mess
For saying things
I didn't mean
And don't believe


Believe in me
Believe in nothing
Corner me
And make me something
I've become
The hollow man, have
I become
The hollow man I see?

Oh, I see
This echoing

You have placed
Your trust in me
I went upside down
I emptied up the room
Thirty seconds left
I can't believe
You held your ground

Believe in me
Believe in nothing
Corner me
And make me something
I've become
The hollow man, have
I become
The hollow man I see?

I'm overwhelmed
I'm on repeat
I'm emptied out
I'm incomplete
You trusted me
I want to show you
I don't want to be
The hollow man

Believe in me
Believe in nothing
Corner me
And make me something
I've become
The hollow man, have
I become
The hollow man I see?
I see...
