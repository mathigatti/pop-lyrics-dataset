1. They're going wild, the call came in
At early morning predawn then.
The followers og chaos out of control.
They're numbering the monkeys, the monkeys and the monkeys.
The followers of chaos out of control.


The Call came in to  party central
Meeting of the green and simple
Try to tell us something we don't know.

2. They're meeting at the monument, the call came in themonument.
To liberty and honor under the honer roll.
They've gathered up the cages, the cages and courageous.
The followers of chaos out of control.

The Call came in to  party central
Meeting of the green and simple
Try to tell us something we don't know

Disturbance at the heron house, a stampede at the monument.
To liberty and honor under the honor roll.
The gathering of the grunts and greens, cogs and grunts andhirelings.
A meeting of a mean idea to hold.

When feeding time has come and gone.
They'll lose the heart and head for home.
Try to tell us something we don't know.
