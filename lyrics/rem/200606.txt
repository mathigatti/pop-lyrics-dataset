You're funny and you don't know why
You're funny and you can't even cry
You're funny and you don't know why
You're funny and you don't even try


(chorus)
Cause your head's shaking cause your arms are shaking
And your feet are shaking cause the earth is shaking
Cause your head's shaking cause your arms are shaking
And your feet are shaking cause the earth is shaking

You're hungry and you don't know why
You're hungry and you can't even cry
You're hungry and you don't know why
You're hungry and you don't even cry

(repeat chorus)

You take a walk and you try to understand
Nothing can hurt you
Unless you want it to
There are no answers
Many reasons to be strong
You take a walk, you take a walk
You take a walk and you try to understand

You're in love and you don't know why
You're in love and you can't even cry
You're in love and you don't know why
You're in love and you don't even try
