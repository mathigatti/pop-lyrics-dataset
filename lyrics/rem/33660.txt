The rain came down
the rain came down
the rain came down on me
The wind blew strong
and Summer's song
it fades to memory.


I knew you when
I loved you then
in Summer's yawn, now hopeless.
You laid me bare
and marked me there
the promises we made.

I used to think, as birds take wing,
they sing through life, so why can't we?
We cling to this, and claim the best
if this is what you're offering
I'll take the rain, I'll take the rain.

The nighttime creases
Summer schemes
and stretches out to stay
The sun shines down
you came around
you loved the easy days.

But now the sun
the Winter's come
I wanted just to say
That if I hold
I'd hoped you'd fold
and open up inside, inside of me.

I used to think, as birds take wing,
they sing through life, so why can't we?
We cling to this, and claim the best
if this is what you're offering
I'll take the rain, I'll take the rain, I'll take the rain.

This Winter's song
I'll sing along
I've searched its still refrain.
I'll walk alone
if given this
take wing, and celebrate the rain.

I used to think, as birds take wing,
they sing through life, so why can't we?
We cling to this, and claim the best
if this is what you're offering
I'll take the rain, I'll take the rain, I'll take the rain.
