I see your money on the floor, I felt the pocket change. 
Though all the feelings that broke through that door 
just didn't seem to be too real. 
The yard is nothing but a fence, the sun just hurts my eyes. 
Somewhere it must be time for penitence.  Gardening at night is never where. 
Gardening at night.  Gardening at night.  Gardening at night. 


The neighbors go to bed at ten. 
Call the prayer line for a change. 
The charge is changing every month. 
They said it couldn't be arranged. 

We ankled up the garbage sound, but they were busy in the rows. 
We fell up, not to see the sun, gardening at night just didn't grow. 
I see your money on the floor, I felt the pocket change. 
Though all the feelings that broke through that door 
just didn't seem to be too real. 
Gardening at night.  Gardening at night.  Gardening at night 

Your sister said that you're too young. 
They should know they've been there twice. 
The call was 2 and 51. 
They said it couldn't be arranged. 

I see your money on the floor, I felt the pocket change. 
Though all the feelings that broke through that door 
just didn't seem to be too real. 
We ankled up the garbage sound, but they were busy in the rows. 
We fell up not to see the sun, gardening at night just didn't grow. 
Gardening at night.  Gardening at night.  Gardening at night
