(That beat, that beat, that beat)

Eastern calls from way out wherever
Away I go, anchored in that beat
Thirsting for us too, three's a no man, but


(chorus)
Remember, call that beat
Remember, call that beat

Finger lead them up, crime to rape the beat
Thirsting for us too, three's a no man, but

(repeat chorus 2x)

Finger lead them up (up), crime to rape the beat
Thirsting for us too (too), three's a no man, but

(repeat chorus 2x)
