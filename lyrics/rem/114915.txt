I wore the clothes you wanted
I took your name
If there is some confusion, who's to blame?


I signed your living will
I smiled your face
I'm ready to close the book on NASA in outer space

(chorus)
If there is some confusion
Who's to blame?
Who's to blame?

I sequenced your arrival
I sealed your fate
I pushed the button and erased your master tape

I wrote the sales pitch
I threw the brake switch
I dragged your big ass daddy roth car out of that ditch

(repeat chorus)

I crossed your great divide
I stirred your ocean's tide
I called your bluff until I blew your circuits wide

I'll be your albatross,
Devil, dog, Jesus, God,
I don't wanna be Iggy Pop but if that's what it takes, hey

If there is some confusion
If there is some confusion
If there is some confusion
Who's to blame?
Who's to blame?
Who's to blame?
