As the sun comes up
As the moon goes down
These heavy notions creep around
It makes me think
Long ago
I was brought into this life a little lamb
A little lamb
Courageous, stumbling
Fearless was my middle name
But somewhere there I lost my way
Everyone walks the same
Expecting me to step
The narrow path they've laid
They claim to


Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high

Say "keep within the boundaries if you want to play"
Say "contradiction only makes it harder"
How can I be what I want to be?
When all I want to do is strip away
These stilled constraints
And crush this charade
Shred this sad masquerade
I don't need no persuading
I'll trip, fall, pick myself up and

Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
If I have a bag of rocks to carry as I go
I just want to hold my head up high
I don't care what I have to step over
I'm prepared to look you in the eye
Look me in the eye
And if you see familiarity
Then celebrate the contradiction
Help me when I fall to

Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
