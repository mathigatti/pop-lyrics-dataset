When I was young, a year of hate
My medium, a rattlesnake
When I was young and full of flight
My medium, evening light
When I was young and full of grace
My medium, a pretty face
When I was young and fever fell
My medium, I would not tell
I will not tell


(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
(Don't be a looser)

When I was young, a year of hate
My medium, a rattlesnake
When I was young and full of flight
My medium, evening light
When I was young and full of grace
My medium, a pretty face
When I was young and fever fell
My medium, I would not tell
I will not fight

(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
(Don't be a looser)

Can you turn the guitar up a little bit?

When I would move
And the wind would move
And the wind would move
And I would move and
Our medium was a parachute
Our medium

When I was young and full of flight
My medium, evening light
When I was young and fever fell
My medium, I would not tell
I will not fight

(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)

And now I'm young and full of life
Our medium, is giving up
Giving in

(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
Throw those trolls away
(Don't be a looser)
