A handshake is worthy its all that you got


Metal shoes on wood pushed your arm back
theres a splinter in your eye and it reads react

They shifted the statues for harboring ghosts
reddened their necks and collared their clothes

she gatherd the corners and called it her gown

She said Oh.
Please find my harbor coat
Cant go outside with out it.
Find my harbor coat
cant go outside with out it.
