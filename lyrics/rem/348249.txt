Too, too, took her so long
I was only having fun
I guess I'm really hung
I guess you'd better run


That's what Lisa said

While you running all over town
Why don't you settle down
I told her we were just friends
She believed it till the end

(chorus)
That's what Lisa said
That's what she said

She's a (cherry?) now
She put me on her
She put you on trial
No, I'm in her

Too, too, took her so long
I was only having fun
I guess I'm not so hung
I guess you'd better run

(repeat chorus)
