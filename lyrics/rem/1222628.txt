Turning on the TV 
And what do I see?
A pageantry 
Of empty gestures 
All lined up for me 
Wow
I'd have thought by now 
We would be 
Ready to proceed
But a tearful hymn 
To tug the heart
And a man-sized wreath 
Ow


Throw it on the fire
Throw it in the air
Kick it out 
On the dance-floor 
Like you 
Just don't care, oh
Give me the sound

Wave the palms 
Steal the alms 
Fists in the air
A motorcade up benign 
Shows the people 
That you care 
Ow
Nature abhors a vacuum 
But what's 
Between your ears?
Your judgement clouded 
With fearful thoughts
A headlights and a deer 
Ow

Throw it on the fire
Throw it in the air
Kick it out 
On the dance-floor 
Like you just don't care
Look at what I've found

Everybody look around
Everybody looking 
Like they 
Just don't care, oh
Give me the sound

Well 
I'm not deceived by pomp 
And odious conceit
But a tearful hymn 
To tug the heart
And a man-sized wreath-ow

Throw it on the fire
Throw it in the air
Kick it out 
On the dance-floor 
Like you just don't care
Look at what I've found
Everybody look around
Everybody looking 
Like they 
Just don't care

Throw it on the fire
Throw it in the air
Kick it out 
On the dance-floor 
Like you 
Just don't care, oh
Give me the sound
Give me the sound
Give me the sound
