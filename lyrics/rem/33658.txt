Mercury is rising still
Turn the fan on high
I won't step on my own shadow
no one wants to cry.


Someone put a pox on me
I'll spit in their eye.

Summer turns to high.

With my bedsheet cape and sandals
circle citronella candles.
Summer's here, the light is raising
hopes and dragonflies.

If those hopes are overshadowed
cotton candy, caramel apple.

Summer turns to high
Summer turns to high
Summer turns to high,
Summer high

After wine and nectarines
the fireflies and time
move like syrup through the evening
with a sweet resign.

I won't pine for what could have been -
I'm preoccupied!

Summer turns to high
Summer turns to high
Summer turns to high,
Summer high.
