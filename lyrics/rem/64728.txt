The concrete broke your fall
to hear you speak of it
I'd have done anything
I would do anything
I feel like a cartoon brick wall
to hear you speak of it
you've been so sad
it makes me worry
why not smile?
you've been sad for a while.
why not smile?


I would do anything
to hear you speak of it.
why not smile?
you've been sad for a while.
you've been sad for a while.
