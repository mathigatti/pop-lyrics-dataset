Funtime

(A cover of a track by Iggy Pop, David Bowie and James Osterberg.)

(Fun!) baby, baby, we like your lips
(Fun!) baby, baby, we love your pants
All aboard for Fun Time


(Fun!) baby, baby, we ham to Dracula
(Fun!) oh, and his hips
All aboard for Fun Time

(Fun!) baby, baby, we want in
(Fun!) we want some, we want some
All aboard For Fun Time

(Fun!) baby, baby, we want in
(Fun!) we want some, we want some
All aboard for Fun Time

All aboard for Fun Time
All aboard for Fun Time
All aboard for Fun Time

Fun!
