Light voices scream, nothing seems real's a dream
Leaving the things that you learned behind
Leaving the things that you love behind
All of the things that you learned were real
Nothing except for the years
Voices scream, nothing seems real's a dream


(chorus)
Toys, toys, toys in the attic
Toys, toys, toys in the attic
Toys, toys, toys in the attic

Leaving the things that you love behind
Leaving the things that you learned behind
All of the things that you learned were real
Nothing except for the years
Voices scream, nothing seems real's a dream

(repeat chorus)
