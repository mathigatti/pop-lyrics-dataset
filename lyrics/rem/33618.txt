I sat there looking ugly
Looking ugly and mean
I knew what you were saying
You were saying to me


Baby's got some new rules
Baby said she's had it with me
It seems a shame to waste your time on me
It seems a lot to waste your time for me

Left me to love
What it's doing to me

There's a lot of honey in this world
Baby this honey's from me
You've got to do what you do
Do it with me
It seems a shame to waste your time for me

Left me to love
What it's doing to me

Knocked silly
Knock flat
Sideways down
These things they pick you up
and they turn you around
Say your piece
Say you're sweet for me
It's all the same to share the pain with me
It's all the same, save the shame for me

Left me to love
What it's doing to me

Baby's got some new rules
Baby says she's had it with me
There's a fly in the honey
And baby's got a baby with me
That's a part
That's a part of me

Left me to love
What it's doing to me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me
What about me?
What about me?
