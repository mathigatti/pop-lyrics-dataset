Out there are silver
Dressed darlings
And ramen mein
Delights
When ginger hair
Gets all fired up
She beats them
In the night
That redhead walking
Uh


Don't get close
She'll warn you
With her growl
She's a bud cuttin'
Star studded
Leather chested girl
Out there
A redhead walkin'
Redhead walkin'
The redhead walkin'
Better listen
Keep your distance
From the crimson
Crime warpath

O kiss that girl
Kiss that girl
Kiss that girt

Yeah
She'll cut your heart
Like diamonds
End of story
You bet
You're gonna lose it
To that hellbound
Crimson glory

There a redhead walkin'
A redhead walkin'
A redhead walkin'
Heed what this
Wise man says
Keep away from redheads
