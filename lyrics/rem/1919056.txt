Everybody here
Comes from somewhere
But they would just as soon forget
and disguise
Disguised as they know what I made I feel it
No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
If that apparition had just appeared
Took you up and away from this place and sheer humiliation
Of your teenage station
Nobody cares no one remembers or cares


No one cares if your fantasies are
Dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets
Two, three, four

If you call out safe then I'll stop right away
If the premise explode and the world starts to shake
For the details great
With the stories the same
You don't have to explain
You don't have to explain
Humiliation
Of your teenage station

No one cares if your fantasies are
Dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets

Everybody here comes from somewhere
If they would just as soon forget,
And disguise
Disguised as they know what I feel I feel it
At the summer camp where you volunteered
No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
If that apparition had just appeared
Took you up and away from this place and sheer humiliation
Of your teenage station
A celebration Of your teenage station
Nobody cares no one remembers and nobody cares
Nobody cares no one remembers and nobody cares
