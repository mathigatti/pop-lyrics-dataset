Oddfellows local 151 behind the firehouse
Where Peewee sits to prove a sage to teach
Peewee gathered up his proof
Reached up and scratched his head
Fell down and hit the ground again


(chorus)
Firehouse, firehouse

Why do the heathens rage behind the firehouse
Where Peewee sits upon the wall to preach
This boy and girl that gather pearls
Of wisdom falling from his mouth
Wash off the blood, wash off the rum

(repeat chorus)

Oddfellows local 151 behind the firehouse
Where Peewee sits upon the wall to preach
This boy and girl that gather pearls
Of wisdom falling from his mouth
Wash off the blood, wash off the 151

(repeat chorus 2x)

Firehouse
