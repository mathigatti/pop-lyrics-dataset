It feels in dreams
That everything is there for you
The city breathes and pulses
It's for you electron blue


I knew that you could see right through it
So this is where I give in to the machine
Lift up your voice feel gravity's pull
Drown out the siren's ring (or silent dream)

Oh...

It's all here where I keep it
It's all in the submarine
It's all a lot less frightening
than you would have had it be
But that's the good news my darling
It is what it's going to be
So sing, sing for the submarine

I tried to explain how it all begins
How its all destroyed and built again
I knew that you could not believe me
But now you're here and it's different
How the light shines in your eyes
In every second or situ
It's then that I realised
That the world as we know it
The High speed train
We'll pick it all up and start again

It's all here where I keep it

It's all in the submarine
It's all a lot less frightening
than you would have had it be
But that's the good news my darling
It is what it's going to be
So sing, sing for the submarine

The city did not collapse in a shudder
The rain it never came
At least my confessions made you laugh
I know it's a little crazed
But these dreams...
they seem so real to me

It's all here where I keep it
It's all in the submarine
It's all a lot less frightening
than you would have had it be
But that's the good news my darling
It is what it's going to be
So sing, sing for the submarine

So this is where you trust me
And this where it begins
It's all a lot less frightening
Your tear you let it in
Tyrel and his mechanical owl
A moth disguised as a leaf...
Don't tell me what tomorrow brings
Climb into the hidden machine and
sing sing sing sing sing sing
sing sing for the submarine
