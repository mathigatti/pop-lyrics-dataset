Follow me, don't follow me
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
Collar me, don't collar me
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
We are agents of the free
I've had my fun and now its time to
Serve your conscience overseas (over me, not over me)
Coming in fast, over me


High on the roof
Thin the blood
Another one climbs on the waves tonight
Comin' in, you're home

We'd circle and we'd circle and we'd circle to stop and considerand
Centered on the pavement stacked up all the trucks jacked upand
Our wheels in slush and orange crush in pocket and all this herecounty
Hell any county it's just like heaven here and I was rememberingand I
Was just in a different county and all then this whirlybird thati
Headed for I had my goggles pulled off I knew it all I knew everyback
Road and every truck stop

Follow me, don't follow me
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
Collar me, don't collar me
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
We are agents of the free
I've had my fun and now its time to
Serve your conscience overseas (over me, not over me)
Coming in fast, over me

High on the roof
Thin the blood
Another one climbs on the waves tonight
Comin' in, you're home
