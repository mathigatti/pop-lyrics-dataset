I know you say
Maybe some day
I need never be alone
I know I say
It's the right way
But you'll never be the one


I've been walking alone now
For a long long, long time
I don't wanna hang out now
With the friends that just don't mind

I do party
You've been looking
But your searching never ends
You've been hanging
With the wrong crowd
You've got all the right friends

I've been walking alone now
For a long, long time
I don't wanna hang out now
With the friends that just aren't mine

I don't wanna be with you anymore
I just don't want you anymore
I don't wanna be with you anymore
I just don't want you anymore
