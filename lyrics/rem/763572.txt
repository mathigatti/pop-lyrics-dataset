So long boy you can take my place,
got my papers I've got my pay
So pack my bags and I'll be on my way to yellow river
Put my guns down the war is won
Fill my glass high the time has come
I'm going back to the place that I love yellow river


Yellow river yellow river is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow river yellow river is in my blood it's the place I love
Got no time for explanation got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me sleeping underneath the moon at yellow river

Cannon fire lingers in my mind
I'm so glad that I'm still alive
And I've been gone for such a long time from yellow river
I remember the nights were cool
I can still see the water pool
And I remember the girl that I knew from yellow river

Yellow river yellow river is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow river yellow river is in my blood it's the place I love
Got no time for explanation got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me sleeping underneath the moon at yellow river
(repeat)
