Nothing could be bring me closer.
nothing could be bring me near.
where is the road I follow
to leave, leave?


It's under, under, under my feet.
the sea spread out there before me.
where do I go when the land touches sea?
there is my trust in what I believe.

That's what keeps me,
that's what keeps me,
that's what keeps me down,
to leave, believe it,
leave it all behind.

Shifting the dream
nothing could bring me further from my old friend time.
shifting the dream
it's charging the scene
I know where I marked the signs.

I suffer the dreams of a world gone mad
I like it like that and I know it
I know it well, ugly and sweet,
that temper madness with an even extreme.

That's what keeps me
that's what keeps me
that's what keeps me down
I say that I'm a bantam lightweight
I say that I'm a phantom airplane
that never left the ground.

That's what keeps me,
that's what keeps me,
that's what keeps me down,
to leave it, believe it.
leave it all behind.

Lift me, lift me,
I attain my dream.
I lost myself, I lost the
heartache calling me.
I lost myself in sorrow
I lost myself in pain.
I lost myself in clarity,
memory, leave, leave.

That's what keeps me,
that's what keeps me,
that's what keeps me down,
To leave it, believe it,
leave it all behind.

That's what keeps me,
that's what keeps me,
that's what keeps me down,
to leave it, believe it,
leave it all behind.

Lift my hands, my eyes are still,
I'll walk into the sea
shoot myself in a different place
and leave it

I've longed for this to take me,
I've longed for my release
I've waited for the callin'
to leave, leave.

Leave, leave.
Leavin', leavin'
