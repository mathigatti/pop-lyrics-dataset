There's a problem feathers iron
Bargain buildings weights and pullies
Feathers hit the ground
Before the weight can leave the air


Buy the sky and sell the sky
And tell the sky and tell the sky

Don't fall on me
What is it up in the air for
Fall on me
If it's there for long
Fall on me
It's over it's over me

There's the progress we have found
A way to talk around the problem
Building towered foresight
Isn't anything at all

Buy the sky and sell the sky
And bleed the sky and tell the sky

Don't fall on me
What is it up in the air for
Fall on me
If it's there for long
Fall on me
It's over it's over me

Fall on me

Well I would keep it above
But then it wouldn't be sky anymore
So if I send it to you
You've got to promise to keep it home

Buy the sky and sell the sky
And lift your arms up to the sky
And ask the sky and ask the sky

Don't fall on me
What is it up in the air for
Fall on me
If it's there for long
Fall on me
It's over it's over me
