&amp;#65279;These bastards stole their power from the victims of theUs v. Them years
Wrecking all things virtuous and true
The undermining social democratic downhill slide into abysmal
Lost lamb off the precipice into the trickle down runoff pool


They hypnotized the summer, 1979
Marched into the capital
Brooding duplicitous, wicked and able, media-ready, heartless andlabeled
Super U.S. citizen, super achiever, mega-ultra power dosing
Relax.  Defense, defense, defense, defense.  Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ignoreland
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ignoreland

The information nation took their clues from all the sound-bitegluttons
1980, 84, 88, 92, too.  Too
How to be what you can be
Jump jam junking your energies
How to walk in dignity with throw up on your shoes
They amplified the autumn, 1979
Calculate the capital
Up the republic, my skinny ass, T.V. tells a million lies
The paper's terrified to report anything that isn't handed on apresidential spoon
I'm just profoundly frustrated by all this
So, fuck you man (Fuck 'em)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ignoreland
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ignoreland

If they weren't there, we would have created them
Maybe it is true
But I'm resentful all the same
Someone's got to take the blame
I know that this is vitriol
No solution, spleen-venting
But I feel better having screamed, don't you?
They desecrated winter, 1979
Capital collateral
Brooding duplicitous, wicked and able, media-ready, heartless andlabeled
Super U.S. citizen, super achiever, mega-ultra power dosing
Relax.  Defense, defense, defense, defense.  Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ignoreland
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ignoreland
yeah, yeah, yeah
Ignoreland
Yeah, yeah, yeah
