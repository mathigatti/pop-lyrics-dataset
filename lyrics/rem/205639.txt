He's not to be reached, he's to be reached
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached


Called the fool and the company,
On his own where he'd rather be
Where he ought to be, he sees what you can't see, can't you see
that?

(chorus)
Maybe he's caught in the legend,
Maybe he's caught in the mood
Maybe these maps and legends
Have been misunderstood

Down the way the road's divided,
Paint me the places you have seen
Those who know what I don't know
Refer to the yellow, red and green

(repeat chorus)

He's not to be reached, he's to be reached
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached

The map that you painted didn't seem real
He just sings whatever he's seen
Point to the legend, point to the east,
Point to the yellow, red and green

Maybe he's caught in the legend,
Maybe he's caught in the mood
Maybe these maps and legends
Have been misunderstood, been misunderstood

Is he to be reached? He's not to be reached
Is he to be reached? He's not to be reached
Is he to be reached? He's not to be reached anymore
