Nations call
Par-parallels
Neighbors call
All in all, in all, in all, in all


(chorus 1)
That's worth saving up for
Put our heads down on the chest
Mustn't even race for rest
Easy come, easy go

(chorus 2)
Easy come
Easy go
Easy come
Easy go

Stares conceal
Par-parallels
Neigh-neighbors call
All in all, in all, in all, in all

(repeat chorus 1)

(repeat chorus 2)

Chance is yours
And call the shot
Even in a parking lot
With one romance
One romance

(repeat chorus 2)

Neighbors call
Par-parallel
Late at night nations fall
All in all, in all, in all, in all

(repeat chorus 1)

(repeat chorus 2)
