I ain't got no cigarettes
It takes four hours of pushin' broom
To buy a four-by-twelve two-bit room
I'm a man of means, by no means
King of the road

(chorus)
Trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No cars, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes
It takes four hours of pushin' broom
To buy a four-by-twelve two-bit room
I'm a man of means, by no means
King of the road

(Take slower)

It takes four hours of pushin' broom
To buy a four-by-twelve two-bit room
I'm a man of means, by no means
King of the road

(One more time)

(repeat chorus)
