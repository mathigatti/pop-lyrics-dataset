The sun reflected in the back of my eye
I knocked my head against the sky.


The dragonflies are busy buzzing me
Seahorses if we were in the sea.

Halfway from coal, halfway to diamond.
My fall knocked a mean chip out of me.

I'm gathering as far as I can reach
we're perched upon the precipice
and this is what I've seen.

This is all I want it's all I need
This is all I am it's everything
This is all I want it's all I need.

A bluejay hectors from the felled Catalpa tree
A doctorate in science and a theologian's dream.

The dragonflies are trying to lecture me
Seahorses if we were in the sea.

This is all I want it's all I need
This is all I am it's everything
This is all I want it's all I need.

Beat a drum for me, like a butterfly wing
Tropical storm across the ocean.

Don't explain, I'm sure I'll want to know.
Don't forget, we're just halfway from coal.

This is all I want it's all I need
This is all I am it's everything
This is all I want it's all I need.
