Moon River, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
You dream maker
You heartbreaker
Wherever you're going
I'm going your way


Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waitin' round the bend
My Huckleberry friend
Moon River and me
