Hey
What's the big deal?
Tell me how to feel?
I know where we boomeranged
And fell from grace.
Point me to the stars 
I'm up for the chase.
I - know - where - we - fell - on - our - face.
Jump - with - me.
You - jump - with - me.


Hey
What's the big deal?
I'm an animal.
(The answer landed on my rooftop. Whoa.)
I'm an animal.
(The future and the truth)
(On my rooftop. Whoa.)
I'm an animal.
(It's calling me to work it out.)
(It's calling me to work it out.)

(Whoa)

I don't wanna boomerang.
I don't wanna cannonball.
I'm not angling.
I don't want to fall.
Tell me I'm the anchor
Of my own ascension.
Tell me
I'm a tourist in the 4th dimension?

(It's calling me to work it out.)

(Whoa)

(Work it out.)

I am vibrating 
At the speed of light.
Take my hand 
We'll wind up the night.
Spin me.
Win me.
Lift me.
Kiss me.
Trip me.
Trust me.
Cuss me.
Judge me.
Touch me now.
You - take - my - hand.
You - trust - me - now.
You - un - der - stand.
