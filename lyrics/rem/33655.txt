I've dragged my feet
across the seat
and jumped out the passenger side.
The only thing worth looking for
is what you find inside.
But that had not yet appeared.
Lost, invisible, here.
Tel Aviv and Agadir,
Taroudant and Olomouc
Before I learned to see
the vanishing point appear.


I looked for you and everywhere.
I looked for you and everywhere.

There is a calm I haven't come to yet
I spend half my life figuring what comes next.
I telescoped in.
I'll finally win,
I'll finally win the prize.
That now my eyes see
a comic's perfect timing squeezed.
I'm headfirst fighting everything
the crushed force of memory
erasing all I've been
the vanishing point appears.

I looked for you and everywhere.
I looked for you and everywhere.
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear.

Look at this face.
Can you believe it?
Am I living in a beautiful vacuum,
because I can't see it.
The vanishing point appears.

I looked for you and everywhere.
I looked for you and everywhere.
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear
I came to disappear.
