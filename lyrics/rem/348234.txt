Mmmm...You're so pretty
Not to talk to you would be a crime
Let me put my arms around you
Just wanna use up a little of your time


And I'm going...
Baby baby baby
Baby baby baby
Baby baby baby
Won't you be my girl?

You're eyes, they're so pretty
The clothes you wear, so fine
Won't you come around to my place
Just wanna use up a little of your time

And I'm going...
Baby baby baby
Baby baby baby
Baby baby baby
Won't you be my girl?

Come on, come on, come on

[SOLO]

Baby baby baby
Won't you be my girl?
