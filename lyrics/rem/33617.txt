Hey, I can't find nothing on the radio
Yo! Turn to that station


The world is collapsing
Around our ears
I turned up the radio
But I can't hear it

When I got to the house
And I called you out
I could tell that you had been crying, crying
It's that same sing song on the radio
It makes me sad
I meant to turn it off
To say goodbye
To leave in quiet
That radio song
Hey, hey, hey

I've everything to show
I've everything to hide
Look into my eyes
Listen

When I got to the show
Yo ho ho
I could tell that you had been crying, crying
It's that same sing song, and the DJ sucks
It makes me sad
I tried to turn it off (turn it off)
To say goodbye my love
That radio song
Hey, hey, hey

The world is collapsing
Around our ears
I turned up the radio
But I can't hear it

Yeah, baby, baby, baby

I tried to sing along
But damn that radio song
Hey hey hey

I've everything to show
I've everything to hide
Look into my eyes listen to the radio
I turned up the radio
But I can't hear it
No, I can't hear it
Hey hey hey
Say what?
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Check it out
What are you saying
What are you playing
Who are you obeying
Day out, day in, huh?
Baby baby baby
That stuff is driving me crazy
DJs communicate to the masses
Sex and violent classes
Now our children grow up prisoners
All their lives radio listeners
