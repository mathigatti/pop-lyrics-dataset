There she goes again
She's out on the street again
She's down on her knees my friend
Won't have to ask her please again


Look a little closer there's no tears in her eyes
You know she won't make it with just any guy
What can you do
See her walking down the street
With all your friends she's gonna meet
You'd better hit her
