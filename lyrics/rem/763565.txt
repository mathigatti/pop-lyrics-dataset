(Hi Michael.
Hi Andy thanks for joining us. Do you want to sing a song together.
Sure. Is it a sweet song?
Yeah, it's real sweet.
OK.)


In this friendly, friendly world,
With each day so full of joy.
Why should any heart be lonely.

My turn. In this friendly, friendly world,
With each night so full of dreams,
Why should any hear be afraid?

The world is such a wonderful place to wander through
When you've got someone you love to wander along with you.

(OK. Take every second word)
With the sky so full of stars,
And the river so full of song
Every heart should be so thankful

The world is such a wonderful place to wander through

And the river so full of song.
(Welcome back Andy)
Every heart should be so thankful
Thankful for this friendly, friendly world.

(Thank you Michael.
Thanks Andy.
Thank you all for this friendly, friendly world.
Thanks for nothing.)
