Dream, dream dream dream, dream, dream dream dream 

When I want you in my arms, when I want you and all your charms 
Whenever I want you, all I have to do, is 


Dream, dream dream dream 

When I feel blue in the night, and I need you to hold me tight 
Whenever I want you, all I have to do, is 

I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine, any time, night or day 
Only trouble is, gee wiz, I'm dreamin' my life away 

I need you so that I could die, I love you so, and that is why 
Whenever I want you, all I have to do, is 

Dream, dream dream dream, dream 

I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine, any time, night or day 
Only trouble is, gee wiz, I'm dreamin' my life away 

I need you so that I could die, I love you so, and that is why 
Whenever I want you, all I have to do, is 

Dream, dream dream dream (repeats out)
