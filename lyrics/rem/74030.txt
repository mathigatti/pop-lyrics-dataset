A public service announcement
Followed me home the other day
I paid it, never mind, go away
Shit so thick you could stir it with a stick-
Free Teflon whitewashed presidency
We're sick of being jerked around
Wear that on your sleeve


Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, Lord
Count your blessings
We're sick of being jerked around
We all fall down

Have you ever seen the televised
St. Vitus subcommittee prize Investigation dance?
Those-ants-in-pants glances
Well, look behind the eyes
It's a hallowed, hollow anesthetized
Save my own ass, screw these guys
Smoke and mirror lock down

Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, Lord
Count your blessings
The papers wouldn't lie!
I sigh, not one more

It's been a bad day
Please don't take a picture
It's been a bad day
Please

We're dug in the deep the price is steep
The auctioneer is such a creep
The lights went out, the oil ran dry
We blamed it on the other guy

Sure, all men are created equal
Here's the church, here's the steeple
Please stay tuned - we cut to sequel
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down

Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, Lord
Count your blessings
Ignore the lower fears
Oh, this means war

Its been a bad day
Please don't take a picture
Its been a bad day
Please

Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, Lord
Count your blessings
Ignore the lower fears
Oh, this means war

It's been a bad day
