It's only when your poison spins
Into the life you'd hoped to live
That suddenly you wake up in a shaking panic
Wow!


You set me up like a lamb to slaughter
Garbo as a farmer's daughter
Unbelievable: the gospel according to who?
I lay right down!

All your sad and lost apostles
Hum my name and flare their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to them
Well I'm not one to sit and spin
'Cause living well's the best revenge
Baby, I am calling you on that

Don't turn your talking points on me
History will set me free
The future's ours and you don't even read the footnote
Now!

So who's chasing you? Where did you go?
You disappeared mid-sentence in a judgement crisis
I see my anecdote for it, you weakened shell

All your sad and lost apostles
Hum my name and flare their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to them
Well I'm not one to sit and spin
'Cause living well's the best revenge
Baby, I am calling you on that

You savour your dying breath
Well, I forgive but I don't forget
You work it out
Let's hear that argument again
Camera three:  go now!

All your sad and lost apostles
Hum my name and flare their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to them
Well I'm not one to sit and spin
'Cause living well's the best revenge
Baby, I am calling you on that
Baby, I am calling you on that
Baby, I am calling you on that
