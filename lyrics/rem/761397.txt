After Hours

(A cover of the track by Velvet Underground, written by Lou Reed)

If you close the door
the night could last forever.
Say goodbye to now
and say hello to never.
I've said it before, I'll say it again.
You know it can happen to me.
But if we close the door
I'll never have to see the world again.
