This could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
Turn to a miracle, high alive
My mind is racing, as it always will
My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away, here
My head sworn


To go it alone, and haul it along
And haul it along, and hold it
Go it alone, and hold it along
Oh

Oh, the lonely deep sit hollow
Half a world, half a world away
My shoes are gone, my life spent
I've had too much to drink
I didn't think, I didn't think of you
I guess that's all I needed

To go it alone, and hold it along
And haul it along, and hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
Oh

Oh, this lonely world is wasted
Pathetic eyes, high alive
Blind to the tide that turns the sea
This storm that came up strong
It shook the trees, and blew away our fear
I couldn't even hear

To go it alone, and hold it along
Haul it along, and hold it
Go it alone, hold it along
Oh

Go it alone, and hold it along
Haul it along, and hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
Oh

Oh, this could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
Turn to a miracle, high alive
My mind is racing, as it always will
My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away

Go
