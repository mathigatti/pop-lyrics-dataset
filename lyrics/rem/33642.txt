("a speed zone up here too")

I never thought of this as funny
It speaks another world to me
I want to be your Easter bunny
I want to be your Christmas tree.


I'll strip the world that you must live in
of all its godforsaken greed.
I'll ply the tar out of your feathers.
I'll pluck the thorns out of your feet.
you and me.
you and me.

and if I choose your sanctuary
I want to wash you with my hair.
I want to drink of sacred fountains
and find the riches hidden there.

I'll eat the lotus and peyote.
I want to hear the caged bird sing.
I want the secrets of the Temple.
I want the finger with the ring.
you and me.
you and me.
you will see.

that if you make me your religion
I'll give you all the room you need.
I'll be the drawing of your breath.
I'll be the cup if you should bleed.

I'll be the sky above the Ganges
I'll be the vast and stormy sea.
I'll be the lights that guide you inward.
I'll be the visions you will see.

the visions you will see.

you will see.
you will see.
you and me.
you and me.
you and me.
