Whenever we hold each other
We hold each other
There's a feeling that's gone
Something has gone wrong
And i don't know how much longer i can take it
House made of heart break it
Take my head in your hands and shake it
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough.


Living inside
Living inside
Near wild heaven

Whatever it takes i'm giving
It's just a gift i'm given
Try to live inside
Trying to move inside
And i always thought that it would make me smarter
But it's only made me harder
My heart thrown open wide
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough.

Living inside
Living inside
Near wild heaven

I'm holding my hands together
I'm holding my feet together
I'm holding myself together
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough
