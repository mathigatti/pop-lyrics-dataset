Could it be that one small voice doesn't count in the room?
Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way
Could this by three be ten? Honor marches on
Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way


Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune

Are we grown up way too far?
Taking after rain
Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way

Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune

In my life
Ears that are still
Children of today on parade
Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way

Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune
