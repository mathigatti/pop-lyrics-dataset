On the outside underneath the wall
All the money couldn't buy
You're mistaken no one's standing there
For the record no one tried


Oh I try to
What if we give it away?

Overlooking with a hollow eye
What's pretending is it right
Eye for order a hand for what's in line
Couldn't follow couldn't write

And our life is fine here
Stitch it on your tie here

Here's the trailer Tom
A year has come and gone
We're not moving was it right
Take the order sew it on your tie
We couldn't follow couldn't try
