When I look into your eyes.
Your drop like an anchor eyes.
I scudded and clipped the sky
Just shy of making it.


And you almost got away.
I told you I was afraid.
Did I really want to try 
You're holding me to my claim

I jump on a high speed train
I'll never look back again
I flail like the antelope
Who jumped from the building

and you caught me on the sly
you've taken me by surprise.
you've mirrored my best disguise and 
turned it back on me. 

I jump on a high speed train
I'll never look back again
I flail like the antelope
Who jumped from the building

I jump on a high speed train
I'll never look back again
To Berlin, Kyoto or Marseilles
I'd go anywhere for you

I'll bring you a big bouquet
I picked it myself today
it compliments your eyes
there's love at the end of the line

I jump on a high speed train
I'll never look back again
I flail like the antelope
Who jumped from the building

I jump on a high speed train
I'll never look back again
To Berlin, Kyoto or Marseilles
I'd go anywhere for you

And that's what I always knew
I'd like to have hung the moon.
I'd wrestle you for a spoon inside your sleeping bag.
Just us. 

No war. no hate. no past.
It's real. 
I'm here. I'm yours. I'm fast.
I'm long in the eye
I'm cry when I try 
I just want to fly
Just you and I, together
