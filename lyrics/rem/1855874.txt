So over me
So pie in my face
So talk to me
Tell me where to place these
In my Quasimodo heart
That's where I slipped and fell
I rang the church bell
Till my ears bled red blood cells


I think I'll sing it and rhyme
I'll give it one more time
I'll show the kids how to do it fine, fine, fine, fine

I hold the mirror off
You tell me what is what
You tell me which part of my story baby stuck, stuck, stuck
I'm in a part of your dreams
That you don't even understand
It's just like me to overstay my welcome men

Let's sing it and rhyme
Let's give it one more time
Let's show the kids how to do it fine, fine, fine, fine

Oh...

I just have to get that off my chest
Now It's time to give on with the best
All the best
All the best
All the best
All the best, best, best

It's just like me to overstay my welcome bless

Let's sing it and rhyme
Let's give it one more time
Let's show the kids how to do it fine, fine, fine, fine
Let's sing it and rhyme
Let's give it one more time
Let's show the kids how to do it fine, fine, fine, fine
