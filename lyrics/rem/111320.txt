Ooooo, we were little boys 
Ooooo, we were little girls 
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off 
Cowered in a hole, opie mouth. Question: 
Did we miss anything? Did we miss anything? 
Did we miss anything? Did we miss anything? 
Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. 


Ooooo, we were little boys

Cowered in a hole, opie mouth. 
We in step, in hand, your mother remembers this. 
Hear the howl of the rope, a question: 
Did we miss anything? Did we miss anything? 
Did we miss anything? Did we miss anything? 
Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. 

March could be darker. March could be darker. 
Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. Catapult.
