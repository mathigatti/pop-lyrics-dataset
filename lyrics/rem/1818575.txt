I would dare you, but I know I don't need to
You're going to do just what you want to
You're going to take the leading chair at the fairground
You're going to sing the praises of your fruit


Mine smell like honey, uh!
Mine smell like honey, uh!
Mine smell like hu- hu- hu- honey, uh!

Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper!
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper!
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper!
Track a trail of honey through it all

If the end comes faster than we had expected
And predictions lead us to the final fall
If the flowers crack the grave and leave the pattern of the pavement
I can hear you shouting over it all

Mine smell like honey, uh!
Mine smell like honey, uh!
Mine smell like hu- hu- hu- honey, uh!

Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper!
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper!
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper!
Track a trail of honey through it all

Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper!
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper!
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper!
Track a trail of honey through it all

You track a trail of honey through it all
You track a trail of honey
