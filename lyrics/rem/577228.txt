Maybe tonight you're achin'
For someone you're dreamin' of
Tomorrow you'll be wakin
Into the Arms, into the arms of Love


Maybe tonight you're cryin
Like a poor wounded dove
Tell me you'll soon be flying
Into the Arms, into the arms of love

Maybe tonight you're takin
You couldn't get enough
Honey you'll soon be wakin'
Into the Arms, into the arms of Love

Maybe the world is falling
It wasn't strong enough
Tell me you'll soon be crawling
Into the Arms, into the arms of Love
(repeat to end
