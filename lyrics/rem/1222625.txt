If the storm
Doesn't kill me
The government will
I've got to get
That out of my head
It's a new day today
And the coffee
Is strong
I've finally
Got some rest


So a man's put to task
And challenges
I was taught to hold
My head high
Collect what is mine
Make the best
Of what today has

Houston is filled
With promise
Laredo
Is a beautiful place
Galveston sings
Like that song
That I loved
It's meaning
Has not been erased

And so there are
Claims forgiven
And so there are things
That are gone

Houston is filled
With promise
Laredo
Is a beautiful place
Galveston sings
Like that song
That I loved
It's meaning
Has not been erased

And some things
They fall
To the wayside
Their memory
Is yet to be still
Belief
Has not filled me
And so I am put
To the test
