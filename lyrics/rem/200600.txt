Women got legs, men got pants
I got the picnic, you got the ants,
Put it in the fire heaven knows
Take my torch and touch your toes in hell


It's a burning hell
You can burn in hell
It's a burning hell
You can burn in hell
It's a burning hell

Women don't fret, boys don't bet
Let me see your silhouette in hell
Women above me take my love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love

It's a burning hell
It's a burning hell
Baby, baby, baby, I'm hell
It's a burning hell

Girl stop moving, boy behave
Baby, I'll put you in an early grave in hell
Love on the ceiling, love on the floor
I'm gonna leave you burning for more
Burn in the country, burn downtown
All the best people are burning down in hell, hell, ah hell

It's a burning hell
You'll burn in hell
It's a big, burning, giant, colossal matter
Hell
Oh, baby, I'm hell

Burn, burn, burn!
