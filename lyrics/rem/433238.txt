A public service announcement followed me home the other day,
I bade it nevermind, go away
The shit's so thick, you could stir it with a stick,
The paper wouldn't lie, we assume the loss to mankind and gloat
and jeer with it


Broadcast me a joyful noise into the times, Lord,
Count your blessings, ignore the lowest fear, well you can't
sandblast glisten

Radio no, play the game, three words, first one short,
Magazine, book, cinema, N - O - down,
Many fears are gone, step down, step down,
Watch a heel crush, ah, this means war

I saw the light, it can't be right

Broadcast me a joyful noise into the times, Lord,
Count your blessings, ignore the lowest fear, well you can't
sandblast

(chorus)
It's been a bad day, please don't take my picture,
It's been a bad day, please
It's been a bad day, please don't take my picture,
It's been a bad day, please

A public service announcement followed me home the other day,
I bade it nevermind,
The shit's so thick, you could stir it with a stick,
The paper wouldn't lie, we assume the loss to mankind and gloat
and jeer with it

I saw the light, it can't be right

Broadcast me a joyful noise into the times, Lord,
Count your blessings, ignore the lowest fear, come one, what
more?

(repeat chorus)
