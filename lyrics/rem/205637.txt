Dusk is dawn is day
Where did it go?
I've been laughing
Fast and slow
Moving in a still frame
Howling at the moon
Morning found me laughing
Up and down, down
Low, low, low
Night suits me fine
And morning suits me fine
I've been so happy, happy
Way up high, high
In between
Down below
Low, low, low
Low, low, low


I skipped the part about love
It seems so silly and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

I said the morning
It isn't your time
Barefoot naked
I can see your lines
It doesn't bother me
That you are right
Your grass is grassy wet
Your light white is bright
Light, white light

I skipped the part about love
It seems so shallow and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low
You and me
We know about time
We know how things go
They come and go
They live and grow
They pass and go
And glow and glow
Up and down
High and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

I skipped the part about love
It seems so silly and low
I skipped the part about love
It seems so shallow and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

I like your hands
All full of glory
All full of glory
