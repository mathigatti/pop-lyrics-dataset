I've latched on, I've been wrong
No one told me what to wear, no one sent me home
Space age party, fascinating, I just don't fit in
Someone throw me anything, the oxygene is thin


If you just can't speak to me, just throw me a line
Give me just a little nod, I could fascinate you

But I am out of place, float in outerspace
No one wants to pull me in its awful saving face
I could fascinate, I could serenade
I'm opinionated, I'll have Vodka Lemonade

If you just can't speak to me, just throw me a line
Give me just a little nod, you are fascinated

I could serenade
We could throw this party and take off on our own
Find our own higher place, an odessy back home

I could not be less included, you could not have known
In my darkest rose and pennant, I am so alone

If you just can't speak to me, just throw me a line
Give me just a little nod, you are fascinated

I could serenade
I could fascinate you
I could resonate
