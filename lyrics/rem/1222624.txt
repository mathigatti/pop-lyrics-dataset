I could have 
Kept my head down
I might have 
Kept my mouth shut
I should have held my own
You lead a horse to water 
And you watch him drown


You're only as big 
As your battles
Rattle my cage 
With your shadow
I'm a phantom-weight 
With a mouth 
Full of feathers
Don't you know 
That what comes around 
Goes around?

I'm not that easy
I am not 
Your horse to water
I hold my breath 
I come around 
Round, round

Don't darken 
My doorstep again
You're mixing up 
Living in chin-chin
You're mixing up 
Lose with win-win
You lead 
A horse to water 
And you watch him drown

You stumble 
On glass top table
TV's chewing 
Shock-gone cable
Pump me up 
A beanstalk fable
And I'll call 
This entertainment

'Cause Humpty's 
Falling down

I'm not that easy
I am not 
Your horse to water
I hold my breath 
I come around 
Round, round

Pick a fight 
An ultra-buzzy bubble
Friday night fuckin' 
Fried-up pub crawl
Phantom-weight 
With a mouth 
Full of feathers
Don't you know 
That what comes around 
Goes around?

I'm not that easy
I am not 
Your horse to water
I hold my breath 
I come around 
Round, round

It's not that easy
I am not 
Your horse to water
I hold my breath 
I come around 
Round, round
It's going down 
Down, down
This runaround 
Round, round
Is bound to pound
The daylights 
Out of you
