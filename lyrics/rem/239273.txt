Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, don't get caught. 
Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, let us out. 
Wilder lower wolves.  Here's a house to put wolves out the door. 
In a corner garden, wilder lower wolves. 
House in order.  House in order.  House in order.  House in order. 
Down there they're rounding a posse to ride. 


(repeat verse) 

Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, don't get caught. 
Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, suspicion us all. 
Wilder lower wolves.  Here's a house to put wolves out the door. 
In a corner garden, wilder lower wolves. 
House in order.  House in order.  House in order.  House in order. 
Down there they're rounding a posse to ride.
