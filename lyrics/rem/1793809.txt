Hey Baby this is not a challenge
It just means that I love you as much as I always said I did
I was, I have been laughable wrong, sandpaper, paper mache, chalk and hung out wet
Oh the city and your skin now na na na na na na na
I didn't have to be afraid I didn't have to feel so stupid
I can see myself. I can feel


That Just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was
Let's all get on with it, now

Discoverer, Discoverer
Discoverer, Discoverer
Laughing, Discoverer

Floating across Houston this is where I am
I see the city rise up tall
The opportunities and possibilites
I have never felt so called.
Rememer the vodka espresson night of discovery
Remember that? Laughing? Discovery?
Oh how I look back and reflect.
How I felt it, how it set
I don't have to feel so wrong
Now I make up dreaming
Saffron, turmerir and brass

Just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was
Let's all get on with it, now

Just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was
Let's all get on with it, now

Discoverer, Discoverer
Discoverer, Discoverer
Discoverer
