Sleep delays my life (get up, get up)
Where does time go? (get up, get up, get up)
I don't know
Sleep, sleep, sleepy head (get up, get up, get up)
Wake it up...up (get up, get up)
You've got all your life (way up ahead) (get up, get up, getup)


Dreams they complicate my life (Dreams they complement my life)

I've seen you laying pined (get up, get up)
I've seen you laying pined (get up, get up)
Life is rough...rough (get up, get up, get up)
I've seen you laying down (get up)
With the loving kind (get up, get up)
I know life is hard...hard (where goes your time?)
Where to turn? Where to turn?

Dreams they complicate my life (Dreams they complement my life)

Dreamtime...

Dreams they complicate my life (Dreams they complement my life)
This time, no escape, I wake up. (get up, get up)
