When I was watching TV back in 73
A skinny old man sure appealed to me
His name by now, I'm sure you know
The man who played a starring role in Jacques Cousteau
Oh, I


And ever since then I've written the dude
Dreaming of swimming around the
Coral reef
I'd even bought my camera and my scuba gear
If only Jacques had called to stop a career
Oh, I

(chorus)
I wanna be a narrator
I wanna be a narrator (I wanna be a narrator)
For the Jacques Cousteau show
For the Jacques Cousteau show (for the Jacques Cousteau show)

Swimming under water with my microphone
I'd record noises in the aqua-zone
Chasing down the killer whale that's eating our crew
Just to bring the story facts back to you
Oh, I

(repeat chorus)

I've written the networks, sent my picture too
Done everything I could possibly do
I've given up trying to get through to him
Maybe he knows I don't know how to swim
Oh, I

(repeat chorus)
