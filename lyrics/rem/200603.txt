There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel
Diminish, a carnival of sorts
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel
Stranger, stranger to these parts


(chorus)
Gentlemen don't get caught, cages under cage. gentlemen don't
Get caught,
Box cars (are pulling) out of town, box cars (are pulling) out
Of town
Box cars (are pulling) out of town

There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel
Diminish, a carnival of sorts
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel
Stranger, stranger

(repeat chorus)

Cages under, cages under, cages under cage
Cages under, cages under, cages under cage

(repeat chorus)

There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel
Stranger, stranger to these parts
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel
Diminish, stranger

(repeat chorus)

Box cars are pulling a carnival of sorts
Out of town, out of town
