He's got his work and she comes easy
They each come around when the other is gone
Me, I think I got stuck somewhere in between
I wouldn't confide in the Prodigal Son
The die has been cast, the battle is won
The bullets were blanks, a double aught gun
I couldn't admit to a minute of fun


(chorus 1)
They come and they come and they come and they come
I accepted with a gentle tongue
No words spoken, no need to speak

Take it, stomp twice, ring the bell
Tether that ring and phrase
Enough with the rifle and talk already
We all know what it means
Take this conversation to your great divide
I can only swallow what I ate
And I don't hate him
And I don't hate her

They come and they come and they come and they come
I accepted with a gentle tongue
No heart broken, no need to speak

(chorus 2)
(Don't talk to me)
Don't talk to me about being alone
(Don't talk to me)
Don't talk to me about being alone
(Don't talk to me)
Don't talk to me about being alone

Reach for each other before you leave
Reach peace with a E-A-C
Don't threaten me with a gentle tease
Don't threaten me with angry
Please, please, please
Don't try to tell me what I am

(repeat chorus 1)

(repeat chorus 2)

(Talk to me)
Don't talk to me
(Talk to me)
Don't talk to me
(Don't talk to me)
Don't talk to me
(Don't talk to me)
Don't talk to me about being alone
