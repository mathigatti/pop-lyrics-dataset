You wanted a challenge
That's calling you higher
I landed on my feet by crawling
I remember standing alone trying to forget you idling
I hate to admit that that's my reference point
But there it is
You say you want me


I'm what you found
I'm upside down
You're in the air
You're in the air
And I am breathing

Brighten the stars
The weather is lifting
The heavens love
A love like this
It's pulling you higher
Twist it and turn this around
It lights from within it
Dribbles your chin
Now brings a smile
I'm lost again
I'm lost again

I'm what you found
I'm upside down
You're in the air
You're in the air
And I am breathing you

I want the stars to know they've won
If only to beguile
The sky has opened up again
In heaven reconciled
I want you naked
I want you wild
I want the stars to know they win
Give me that smile
Just give it me
Just turn it on
I'm lost again

I'm what you found
I'm upside down
You're in the air
I'm what you found
I'm upside down
You're in the air
I'm what you found
I'm upside down
You're everywhere
You're in the air
And I am breathing you
