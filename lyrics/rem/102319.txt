It's quiet now
And what it brings
Is everything


Comes calling back
A brilliant night
I'm still awake

I looked ahead I'm sure I saw you there

You don't need me to tell you now
That nothing can compare

You might have laughed if I told you
You might have hidden the frown
You might have succeeded in changing me
I might have been turned around

It's easier to leave than to be left behind
Leaving was never my proud
Leaving New York, never easy
I saw the light fading out

Now life is sweet
And what it brings
I try to take

The loneliness
It wears me out
It lies in wait

And on our loss still in my eyes
Shadow of necklace across your thigh
I might have lived my life in a dream, but I swear
This is real

Memory fuses and shatters out glass
But carry your future, forget the past
But it's you, it's what I feel.

You might have laughed if I told you
(It's pulling me apart)
You might have hidden the frown
(Change)
You might have succeeded in changing me
(It's pulling me apart)
I might have been turned around
(Change)
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
(It's pulling me apart)
Leaving was never my proud
(Change)
Leaving New York, never easy
(It's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out

You find it in your heart
It's pulling me apart
You find it in your heart
Change

I told you, forever, I love you, forever
I told you, I love you, I love you, forever
I told you, forever, I love you, forever
I told you, I love you, I love you, forever
And ever, and ever, you told me, forever...

You might have laughed if I told you
(It's pulling me apart)
You might have hidden the frown
(Change)
You might have succeeded in changing me
(It's pulling me apart)
I might have been turned around
(Change)
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
(It's pulling me apart)
Leaving was never my proud
(Change)
Leaving New York, never easy
(It's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out
(Change)
Leaving New York, never easy
(It's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out
(Change)
Leaving New York, never easy
(It's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out
(Change)
