Hey hey.

I was hell
sarcastic silver swell.
that day it rained
tough spun. hard won. no
ocean flower aquarium
badlands. give a hand.
honey dipt. flim flam
hey hey. hey hey.
that cat can walk like a big bad man.


so happy to show us
I ate the lotus.
say haven't you noticed?
I ate the lotus

storefront window, I reflect.
just last week I was merely heck
tip the scale. I was hell
picked me up, then I fell.
who's this stranger? crowbar spine
...and I feel fine.
let it rain, rain, rain
bring my happy back again.

so happy to show us
I ate the lotus.
say haven't you noticed?
I ate the lotus

let it rain, rain, rain
save me from myself again
wash away my ugly sins
opposing thumb, dorsal fin
that monkey died for my grin
bring my happy back again
let it rain, rain, rain
bring my happy back again

so happy to show us
I ate the lotus.
say haven't you noticed?
I ate the lotus
I ate the lotus
I ate the lotus
