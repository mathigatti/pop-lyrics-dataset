Your revolution is a silly idea, yeah
All your friends are feeling sad
It's like you need a reason to be feeling bad, yeah
You sport an armband when your good and mad, yeah


La la la la revolution (the future never happened)
La la la la revolution

I don't know why i'm feeling bad, yeah
I picked up a bad vibration
Oliver North is running for senate
Bomb the abortion clinic
Reagan's defense is the deficit
The virus was invented
Black man can't get acquitted
Of the crimes that we committed
The future never happened, it never happened

La la la la revolution (the future never happened)
La la la la, I picked up a bad vibration

Your revolution is a silly idea, yeah
You tried to look like a punk rock girl
A whole lotta sneer, and little curl
I don't have time for your theatrics
Everybody knows that you're a bad actress
We've been sorry for way too long, yeah
But the scum is rising, yeah

Yeah
