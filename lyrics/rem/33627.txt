Look up!
What do you see?
All of you and all of me
Fluorescent and starry
Some of them
They surprise


The bus ride
I went to write this
4 A.M.
This letter
Fields of poppies
Little pearls
All the boys and all the girls
Sweet-toothed
Each and every one a little scary
I said your name

I wore it like a badge of teenage film stars
Hash bars, cherry mash and tinfoil tiaras
Dreaming of Maria Callas
Whoever she is
This fame thing
I don't get it
I wrap my hand in plastic to try to look through it
Maybelline eyes and girl-as-boy moves
I can take you far
This star thing
I don't get it

(I'll take you over there)
(I'll take you over there)
(I'll take you over there)
(I'll take you over)

Aluminum, it tastes like fear
Adrenaline, it pulls us near
It tastes like fear

Will you live to 83?
Will you ever welcome me?
Will you show me something that nobody else has seen?
Smoke it
Drink
Here comes the flood
Anything to thin the blood
These corrosives do their magic slowly and sweet
Phone
Eat it
Drink
Just another chink
Duts and dents
They catch the light
Aluminium
The weakest link

I don't want to disappoint you
I'm not here to anoint you
I would lick your feet
But is that the sickest move?
I wear my own crown and sadness and sorrow
And who'd have thought tomorrow could be so strange?
My loss, and here we go again

(I'll take you over there)
(I'll take you over there)
(I'll take you over there)
(I'll take you over there)

Aluminum, it tastes like fear
Adrenaline, it pulls us near
It tastes like fear
It pulls us near

Look up!
What do you see?
All of you and all of me
Fluorescent and starry
Some of them
They surprise

I can't look it in the eyes
Seconal, Spanish fly, absinthe, kerosene
Cherry-flavored neck and collar
I can smell the sorrow on your breath
The sweat, the victory and sorrow
The smell of fear
I got it

(I'll take you over there)
(I'll take you over, take you there)
(I'll take you over, take you there)
(I'll take you over, take you there)

Aluminum, it tastes like fear
Adrenaline, it pulls us near
Aluminum, it tastes like fear
Adrenaline, it pulls us near
It tastes like fear
It pulls us near
It tastes like fear
It pulls us near

(Pulls us near)
It tastes like fear
(Tastes like fear)
It pulls us near

(Pulls us near)
(Over, over, over, over, over there)
(There, there)

I'll take you there
I'll take you there
I'll take you there
I'll take you there
