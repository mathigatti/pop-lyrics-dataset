Oh where are you now?
Pussy willow that smiled on my sleeve
When I was alone, you promised a stone from your heart
My head kissed the ground,
I was half the way down, treading the sand
Please... please lift a hand, I'm only a person
Whose armbands beat on his hands hang tall


Won't you miss me? Wouldn't you miss me at all?

My head touched the ground, I was half the way down,
Strumming the sand
Please lift a hand, I'm only a person
With Eskimo chain, you tattered my brain all the way

Won't you miss me? Wouldn't you miss me at all?
