Hey now, take your pills and
Hey now, make your breakfast
Hey now, comb your hair and off to work
Crash land, no illusions, no collision, no intrusion
My imagination runs away


I know, i know, i know what i am chasing
I know, i know, i know that this is changing me

I am flying on a star into a meteor tonight
I am flying on a star, star, star
I will make it through the day
And then the day becomes the night
I will make it through the night

Hey now, take the u-bahn, five stops, change the station
Hey now, don't forget that change will save you
Hey now, count a thousand-million people, that's astounding
Chasing through the city with their stars on bright

I know, i know, i know what i am chasing
I know, i know, i know that this is changing me

I am flying on a star into a meteor tonight
I am flying on a star, star, star
I will make it through the day
And then the day becomes the night
I will make it through the night

I don't mind repeating, i am not complete
I have never been the gifted type
Hey, man, tell me something, are you off to somewhere?
Do you want to go with me tonight?

I know, i know, i know that this is changing
We walk the streets to feel the ground i'm chasing: Ã¼berlin

I am flying on a star into a meteor tonight
I am flying on a star, star, star
I will make it through the day
And then the day and then the day becomes the night
I will make it through the night
