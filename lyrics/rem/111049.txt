So hesitation pulled me back
I'm stronger when I don't attract
In your eyes I'm a lamb without a rack
And I am getting confused
I'm a cactus trying to be a canoe
As you pan for ore
In the desert, floored
I say to you


That I could never imagine a place so beautiful
I could never steal your gold away.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...

[I try to walk like a big wham bam
I came across like a battering ram
I try to float like a telegram sam
I'm trying to divine you. ]

My book is called "The Ascent Of Man"
I marked your chapter with a catamaran
The accent's off
But I am what I am

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...

[I try to walk like a big wham bam
I came across like a battering ram
I try to float like a telegram sam
I'm trying to divine you.]

I looked for you, it's my last grandstand
A motorscootered goat legged pan
Figure eighting in quicksand ...

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...

[I try to walk like a big wham bam
I try to float like a telegram sam
I came across like a battering ram
I'm trying to divine you. ]

[I try to walk like a big wham bam
I try to float like a telegram sam
I came across like a battering ram
I'm trying to divine you. ]

So hesitation pulled me back
I'm so in love I don't attract
And with my hands tied I won't crack
['Cause in my mind I called you back.]
