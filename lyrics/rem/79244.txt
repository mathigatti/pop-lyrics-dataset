Yeah all those stars drip down like butter
And promises are sweet
We hold out our pans with our hands to catch them
We eat them up, drink them up, up, up, up
Hey, let me in
Hey, let me in


I only wish that I could hear you whisper down
Mister Fisher moved to a less perculiar ground
He gathered up his loved ones and he brought them all around
To say goodbye
Nice try
Hey, let me in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, let me in, let me in

Had a mind to try to stop you
Let me in
Let me in
Well, I got tar on my feet and I can't see all the birds look down and laugh at me
Clumsy, crawling out of my skin

Hey, let me in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, let me in
Hey, let me in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, let me in
