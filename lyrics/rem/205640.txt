Living in cities, living in cars
Living the way you never wanted to
Living in alleys, living it down
Living the way you always thought you'd do


Shakin' it up shakin' it down
Shakin' the way you never wanted to

Living in cities, living in cars
Living the way you always thought
You'd do

You feel so old, I feel so new
Tell me what you want me to
Do you want me to go all night
Do you want me to tell you you're all
Right

Living in cities, living in cars
Living the way you never wanted to

Lord, I feel so new
Tell me what you want me to do

And it's a mystery to me
And it's a mystery to me

Well your trying, trying to look so hard
But you want, but you want, but you want to go

Living in cities, living in cars
Living the way you never wanted to
Shakin' it up, shaking it down
Shakin' the way you always thought you'd do

You feel so old, I feel so new
Tell me what you want me to do
