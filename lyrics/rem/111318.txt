Now what does that mean? 
Is there a just contradiction? 
Nothing much.

If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord, hesitate. 


Got to punch

Twisting tongues 
Gotta stripe down his back 
All nine yards down her back 

Give me a couple, 
Don't give me a couple of pointers, 
Turn to lies and conversation fear.
