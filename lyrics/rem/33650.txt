Grounded, 5 a.m
The nitelite is comforting
But gravity is holding you


Once settled into sleep
You have watched, on repeat
The story of your life
Across the ceiling
And in review

You've said the air was singing
It's calling you, you don't believe
These things you've never seen

"Good morning, and how are you?
The weather's fine, the sky is blue
It's perfect for our seminar"

"Now close your eyes
And start to breathe
Allow the noise to recede
...Allow yourself to drift and fly away"
But you just stay

You've said the air was singing
It's calling you, you don't believe
These things you've never seen, never dreamed.

Did you hear these voices calling

Locked into the conference room
"We're only what our minds assume..."
And rationale is leaving you

This conceit, these systems of belief
Your counselor agrees
"You've always marked these boundaries, now you're free..."
And with relief

You've said the air was singing
It's calling you, you don't believe
These things you've never seen, never heard, never dreamed

You've said the air was singing
It's calling you, you don't believe
These things you've never seen

Never, never, never

Once you had a dream
Of oceans, and sunken cities
Memories of things you've never known
And you have never known.
