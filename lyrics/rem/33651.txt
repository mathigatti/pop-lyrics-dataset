Have you seen?
Have not, will travel.
Have I missed the big reveal?


Do my eyes
Do my eyes seem empty?
I've forgotten how this feels.

I've been high
I've climbed so high
but life sometimes
it washes over me.

Have you been?
Have done, will travel.
I fell down on my knees.

Was I wrong?
I don't know, don't answer.
I just needed to believe.

I've been high
I've climbed so high
but life sometimes
it washes over me.

So
I dive into a pool so cool and deep that if I sink I sink
and when I swim I fly so high

What I want
What I really want is
Just to live my life on high.

And I know
I know you want the same
I can see it in your eyes.

I've been high
I've climbed so high
but life sometimes
it washes over me.

Washes over me
Close my eyes so I can see
make my make-believe believe
in me.
