Mr. Richards 
Your position
Is a messenger pigeon
Left behind you 
When the camp moved on
We thought 
That you would listen
But the words 
Had never crystallized
Into a truth 
That you might own 
Hey, hey


Mr. Richards 
Your decision
Pay attention 
Pay attention

Mr. Richards 
You're forgiven
For a narrow 
Lack of vision
But the fires 
Are still raging on
The public's 
Got opinions
And these consequences 
Border on
The compound 
Tthat you raised
Will sell it see 
Hey, hey

Mr. Richards 
Your decision
Pay attention 
Pay attention

So listen 
Your intention
Sign the papers 
Stamp the ribbon
You're mistaken 
If you think 
We'll just forget

You can thump 
Your chest 
And rattle

Stand in front 
Of your piano
But we know 
What's going on
Yes we know 
What's going on
We're the children 
Of the choir, hey
And we know 
What's going on

Mr. Richards 
Your conviction
Had us cheering 
In the kitchen
Now the jury's 
Eating pigeon pie
So tell me how 
Is prison?
Have they taught you 
How to listen?
We've begun 
To bridge the schism
Pay attention 
Pay attention

Mr. Richards 
Your decision
Pay attention 
Pay attention

You can thump 
Your chest 
And rattle
Stand in front 
Of your piano
But we know 
What's going on
Yes we know 
What's going on
We're the children 
Of the choir, hey
From the compound fire 
Hey
And we know 
What's going on
Yes we know 
What's going on
