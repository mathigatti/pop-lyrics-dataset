It's been pretty simple so far, vacation in Athens is calling me
And knock, knock, knock on wood, I thought I'd left you behind
Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live


The thought of the catacombs left my soul at home
This letter never sent
And it's so far, it's so dark, I'm so lost
Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live
(Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
When I'm moving too fast, where's my new address?

The water is evening now, the catacombs are filling in
If my soul was made of stone, no, not, not so dark, dark

And it's so far, it's so dark, I'm so lost
And it's so far, it's so far, it's so far

Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live
(Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live
(Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
