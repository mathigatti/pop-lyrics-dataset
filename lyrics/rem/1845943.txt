I feel like an alligator
Climbing up the escalator
Climbing up the escalator
I feel strong


I feel like an aviator pilot
Thinks you wouldn't buy it
I'm feeling violent
Beat your bleeding eye in
Hey, hey, alligator, you've got a lot to learn
I have, have got a lot to learn

I feel like an autopilot
I'm the world's strongest island
I feel like a rage coming under my hood
I feel good and calm like a robot would

I feel like an autopilot
I feel like an autopilot
I am not a hater, hater, hater, hater, hater
Hey, hey, alligator, you've got a lot to learn
I have, have got a lot to learn

I feel like a contradiction
I'm a walking science-fiction
I don't know which way to turn
I've got a lot to learn
I've got a lot of lot to learn

If i didn't like the way you stared at me
If i didn't like the way you stared at me
I could sideways, i could knock you blind
I could show you found to the lost and find

I am not an agitator
I feel like an agitator
Climbing up the escalator...
Hey, hey, alligator, you've got a lot to learn
I have got, have got a lot to learn

You've got so much to learn
You got a lot to learn...
