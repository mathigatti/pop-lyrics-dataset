Hey man I'm making moves 
and I am so much stronger than you. 
I am so much stronger, 
I am so much stronger than you. 
Everybody thinks the way that we thought, 
we thought ahead and look what we got. 
I did not invent this world, 
Call my words a string of pearls. 
But you will find the sheen 
loses all its luster.
