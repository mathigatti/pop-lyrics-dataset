Five o'clock friday
All my work is done
I can hardly wait
Let's take the server
Let's sling it around
Let's make it taste so sweet


I wanna take all the saturdays
I wanna stay up late
I wanna stomp my feet on the ground
I wanna celebrate

A month of saturdays, saturdays
A month of saturday, saturdays, ah

I'm tired of waiting for the weekend to begin (sunday, monday, tuesday)
I'm tired of punching in (wednesday, thursday)
Give me a holiday that never ends (friday, saturday)
Give me a weekend, weekend, weekend
Give me a weekend, weekend

A month of saturdays, saturdays
I'm talkin' saturday, saturdays, ah

Shout

Give me a weekend, weekend, weekend
