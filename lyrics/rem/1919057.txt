You said that loving me was falling off a log
You always had a way with words
I'm in a barrel over Niagra Falls
I wonder if I am the first
If I asked of you for just one wish
Would you turn on me and take the fifth?
You're off again on some epic celebration
Shooting barrels full of fish
You found another hole to waltz into
You found another car to crash
I figured out that if you must serve me up
Another of this too shall pass


It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I've been exclusive when it comes to you
I don't recieve at all
I wish I felt the same when you called me late
I almost wished you wouldn't call
God knows what I'm looking for
And god knows what I am
Cause even Jesus had his reservations
I won't be doubting you again
I won't be doubting you again

It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
And I just happened by

I'm living my life, I'm here on the fly
And I just happened by
I just happened by
