I've found a way to make you
I've found a way...
A way to make you smile...


I read bad poetry
Into your machine
I save your messages
Just to hear your voice.
You always listen carefully
To awkwards rhymes.
You always say your name.
Like I wouldn't know it's you,
At your most beautiful.

I've found a way to make you...
I've found a way...
A way to make you smile.

At my most beautiful
I count your eyelashes secretly.
With every one, whisper I love you.
I let you sleep.
I know you're closed eye watching me,
Listening.
I thought I saw a smile.

I've found a way to make you
I've found a way
A way to make you smile...
