Those 
Schoolgirl days
Of telling tales 
And biting nails 
Are gone
But in my mind 
I know 
That they 
Will still live 
On and on
But how 
Do you thank 
Someone
Who has taken you 
From crayons 
To perfume
It isn't easy 
But I'll try


If you wanted 
The sky 
I would write 
Across the sky 
In letters
That would soar 
A thousand feet high
To sir 
With love

The time has come
For closing books 
And long 
Last looks must end
And as I leave
I know 
That I am leaving 
My best friend
A friend who taught me 
Right from wrong
And weak from strong 
That's a lot to learn
What 
What can I give you 
In return

If you 
Wanted the moon 
I would try 
To make a start
But I 
Would rather you 
Let me give 
My heart
To sir 
With love

If you 
Wanted the world 
I'd surround it 
With a wall 
I'd scrawl
These words 
With letters 
Ten feet tall
To sir 
With love
