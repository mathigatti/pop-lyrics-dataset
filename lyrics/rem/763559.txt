Only in America
Can a guy from anywhere
Go to sleep a pauper and wake up a millionaire


Only in America
Can a kid without a cent
Get a break and maybe grow up to be President

Only in America
Land of opportunity, yeah
Would a classy girl like you fall for a poor boy like me

Only in America
Can a kid who's washin' cars
Take a giant step and reach right up and touch the stars

Only in America
Could a dream like this come true
Could a guy like me start with nothing and end up with you

Only in America
Land of opportunity, yeah
Would a classy girl like you fall for a poor boy like me

Only in America (poor boy like me)
Only in America (only in America)
Only in America (only in America)
Only in America (only in America)
Only in America (only in America)
Only in America
