See could stop stop it will red 
We could bind it in the cist 
We could gather, throw a fit

We could bind it in the cist. 
We could gather, throw a fit. 

Up to par and Katie buys a kitchen size, but not me in 
Sit and try for the big key, wasting of time, sitting still 
I can hear you. I can hear you. I can hear you.
