Smack, crack, bushwhacked.
Tie another one to the racks, baby.


Hey kids, rock and roll.
Nobody tells you where to go, baby.

What if I ride? What if you walk?
What if you rock around the clock?
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
What if you did? What if you walk?
What if you tried to get off, baby?

Hey, kids, where are you?
Nobody tells you what to do, baby.

Hey kids, shake a leg.
Maybe you're crazy in the head, baby.

Maybe you did. Maybe you walked.
Maybe you rocked around the clock.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Maybe I ride. Maybe you walk.
Maybe I drive to get off, baby.

Hey kids, shake a leg.
Maybe you're crazy in the head, baby.

Ollie, ollie.
Ollie ollie ollie.
Ollie ollie in come free, baby.

Hey, kids, where are you?
Nobody tells you what to do, baby.

Smack, crack. Shack-a-lack.
Tie another one to your back, baby.

Hey kids, rock and roll.
Nobody tells you where to go, baby.

Maybe you did. Maybe you walk.
Maybe you rock around the clock
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Maybe I ride. Maybe you walk.
Maybe I drive to get off, baby.

Hey kids, where are you?
Nobody tells you what to do, baby.

Hey kids, rock and roll.
Nobody tells you where to go, baby, baby, baby.
