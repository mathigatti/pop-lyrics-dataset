Looks like I pulled a fast one
Looks like I went to town
Looks like the world revolves around me
Looks like it's falling down.


I thought I'd kicked the traces
I thought the wheels would spin
I thought I'd jumped the fence and bolted
Looks like I'm back again

I got my signals crossed.
It's overwhelming because
I'm all alone and I can't get back
Get back with my wanderlust.

I had to grab a suitcase
I had to change my clothes
I had to run the shower hot 
until the water froze

I brushed against confusion
I wanted time to grow
I want the sticks and stones not to throw me 
get back to what I know 

I got my signals crossed.
It's overwhelming because
I'm all alone and I can't get back
Get back with my wanderlust.

I'm searching for a greatness
I smear it on my face
I want to bathe in grape must 
swim the length of the milky way
I want it to be brilliant
I want it to be sweet
I want to kiss the astronauts 
when they salute to me me me me

I got my signals crossed.
It's overwhelming because
I'm all alone and I can't get back
Get back with my wanderlust.

I got my signals crossed.
It's overwhelming because
I'm all alone and I can't get back
Get back with my wanderlust.
