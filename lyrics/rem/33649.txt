Humming
All the way to Reno
You've dusted the non-believers
And challenged the laws of chance
Now, sweet
You're so sugar sweet
You may as well have had kicked me
Fastened on your sleeve


You know what you are
You're gonna be a star
You know what you are
You're gonna be a star

Wing
Is written on your feet
Your achilles heel
Is the tendency
To dream
But you've know that from the beginning
You didn't have to go so far
You didn't have to go

You know what you are
You're gonna be a star
You know what you are
You're gonna be a star

You know who you are
You know who you are
You know who you are

Humming
All the way to Reno
You've written your own directions
And whistled the rules of change

You know what you are
You're gonna be a star
You know what you are
You're gonna be a star
You know what you are
You're gonna be a star
You know what you are
You're gonna be a star

Humming
All the way to Reno
All the way to Reno
All the way to Reno

You're gonna be a star
(You are, you are)
You're gonna be a star
You're gonna be a star
(You are, you are)
You're gonna be a star
