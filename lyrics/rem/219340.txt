And I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backside
And everything will be alright
And everything is yours and mine tonight

Yeah I ride and I ride
I ride through the city at night
I ride through this torn-down side
And everything is yours and mine
Mark out what's yours and mine
We'll make what's yours and mine tonight
We'll make what's yours and mine tonight

Everything will be alright
Yeah everything will be alright
Everything will be alright tonight
