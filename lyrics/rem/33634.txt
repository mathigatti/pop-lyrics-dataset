Charades, pop skill
Water hyacinth
Named by a poet
Imitation of life


Like a koi in a frozen pond
Like a goldfish in a bowl
I don't want to hear you cry

That sugarcane that tasted good
That's cinnamon, that's hollywood
Come on, come on
No one can see you try

You want the greatest thing
The greatest thing since bread came sliced
You've got it all
You've got it sized

Like a friday fashion show teenager
Freezing in the corner
Trying to look like you don't try

That sugarcane that tasted good
That's cinnamon, that's hollywood
Come on, come on
No one can see you try

No one can see you cry

That sugarcane that tasted good
That's freezing rain, that's what you could
Come on, come on
No one can see you cry

This sugarcane, this lemonade
This hurricane, I'm not afraid
Come on, come on
No one can see me cry

This lightning storm, this tidal wave
This avalanche, I'm not afraid
Come on, come on
No one can see me cry

That sugarcane that tasted good
That's who you are, that's what you could
Come on, come on
No one can see you cry

That sugar cane that tasted good
That's who you are, that's what you could
Come on, come on
No one can see you cry
