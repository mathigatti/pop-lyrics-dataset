When the world is a monster
Bad to swallow you whole
Kick the clay that holds the teeth in
Throw your trolls out the door


If you're needing inspiration
Philomath is where I go, I go
Lawyer Jeff he knows the low-down
He's mighty bad to visit home

(chorus)
(I've been there I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way)

When your hands are feeling empty
Stickheads jumping off the ground
Tris is sure to shirr the deers out
Brother Ray can sing my song

(I've been there I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way)
Can't get there from here, here, here
(I've been there I know the way)

Hands down, Calechee bound
Land locked, kiss the ground
The dirt of seven continents going
Round and round
Go on ahead Mr. Citywide
Hypnotize, suit and tie
Gentlemen testify

If your world is a monster
Bad to swallow you whole
Philomath they know the low-down
Throw your trolls out the door

(repeat chorus 2x)

Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way)

(Thank you, Ray)
