Chance, chance, chance, chance

Friday bank card yours got stuck
I loaned you a phone quarter, said "good luck"
Where are you now?


Me and glasses saturday slump
You and your shopping, I looked up
Our eyes met, mine are green
You'd had a peroxide thing
Call now, look me up

Sunday walk, weaver's park
I was on the lakeside
Where the playgrounds meet
In bare feet
You said, "mighty cold today"
You never see what I think
You didn't like your daytime job
I was born to travel

You were a camera, I dropped my keys
I'm on the northbound, you were asleep
I said, "are you holding?"
"You wanna ride the silent sky?"
I wrote a story on the fly
You in the tabletop
I said, "I've had enough of the city."

I held a bag of apples
You at the last table
I had had a soy dog
Cafe streetside, tuesday bloom
You wanna be on fire, I said I hung the moon

Wednesday grocery, corner of vine
You were in the checkout line
I dropped my frozen dinners, you helped pick them up

Thursday cab rush, our block
You with broken accent, my heart stopped
You laughed, I worry

Chance, chance, chance, chance
Swarming like a dozen crushing blows
All those glances, midtime dances
Chance

I never looked it up
You hit the sidewalk talking
Said, "I'd read the ads"
Do you?
Where are you? Cill you read this? can I see?
This is surely moving faster than I can think

A minute shy, a passing eye
I know I saw you there
Will you read this? Wan I see? what did I see?
Chance, chance, chance, chance
Swimming like a dozen crushing blows
All those midtime dances
Chance

Guys, this is very tedious
Stop
