Everybody here
Comes from somewhere
That they would just as soon forget
And disguise
At the summer camp where you volunteered
No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
If that apparition had just appeared
Took you up and away from this place and sheer humiliation
Of your teenage station
Nobody cares no one remembers and nobody cares


Yeah you cried and you cried
He's alive he's alive
Ah, you cried and you cried and you cried and you cried

If you call out safe then I'll stop right away
If the premise buckles and the ropes starts to shake
For the details marked
But the story's the same
You don't have to explain
You don't have to explain
Humiliation
Of your teenage station

Yeah you cried and you cried
He's alive he's alive
Ah, you cried and you cried and you cried
And you realized your fantasies are
Dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets

Everybody here comes from somewhere
If they would just as soon forget,
And disguise

Yeah you cried and you cried
He's alive he's alive
Yeah, you cried and you cried and you cried and you cried
(Oh you cried and you cried)
(Oh you cried and you cried)

Now there's nothing dark and there's nothing weird
Don't be afraid I will hold you near
From the s√©ance where you first betrayed
An open heart on a darkened stage
A celebration
Of your teenage station

Zen inexperience sweet delirious
Supernatural superserious
Inexperience sweet delirious
Supernatural superserious
(Wow)
