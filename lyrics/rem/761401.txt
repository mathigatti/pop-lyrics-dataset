Christmas time is here, happiness and cheer.
Food for all, the children call their favorite time of year.
Snowflakes in the air, candles everywhere,
olden times and ancient rhymes and love and dreams to share.
(Sleigh bells in the air, beauty everywhere,
Yuletide by the fireside and joyful memories there)
Christmas time is here.
We`ll be drawing near.
Hope that we could always see such spirit through the year.
(Sleigh bells in the air, beauty everywhere,
Yuletide by the fireside and joyful memories there)
And joyful memories there.
Christmas time is here.
We`ll be drawing near.
Hope that we could always see such spirit through the year.
Christmas time is here.
(And joyful memories there)
We`ll be drawing near,
Christmas time is here.
