Long gone, intuition to assume are gone when we try. 
Dream of a living jungle in my way back home when we die. 


West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the fields. 
Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. West of the fields. 

Dreams of Elysian, to assume are gone when we try 
Tell now what is dreaming 
When we try to listen with your eyes oversimplify 

The animals, how strange. Try, try to stick it in. 
The animals, how strange. Try, try to stick it in. 

Dreams of Elysian, to assume are gone when we try 
Tell now what is dreaming when we try. 
Listen through your eyes when we die. 

West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the fields. 
Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. West of the fields.
