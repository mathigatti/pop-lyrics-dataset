Receiving department
3 AM
Staff cuts have socked up the overage
Directives are posted
No callbacks, complaints
Everywhere is calm


Hong Kong is present
Taipei awakes
All talk of circadian rhythm

I see today with a newsprint fray
My night is colored headache grey
Daysleeper

The bull and the bear are marking their territories
They're leading the blind with their international glories

I'm the screen
The blinding light
I'm the screen
I work at night

I see today with a newsprint fray
My night is colored headache grey
Don't wake me with so much
Daysleeper

I cried the other night
I can't even say why
Fluorescent flat caffeine lights
Its furious balancing

I'm the screen
The blinding light
I'm the screen
I work at night

I see today with a newsprint fray
My night is colored headache grey
Don't wake me with so much
The ocean machine is set to nine
I'll squeeze into heaven and valentine
My bed is pulling me
Gravity
Daysleeper
Daysleeper
Daysleeper
Daysleeper
Daysleeper
