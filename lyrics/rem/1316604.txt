I am a lineman for the county 
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun 
For another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire 
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita Lineman 
Is still on the line


I know I need a small vacation 
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down 
South won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman 
Is still on the line

And I need you more 
Than want you 
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman 
Is still on the line
