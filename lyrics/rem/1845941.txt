With the walk
And the talk
And the tic-tac clock


With the rock
And the roll
And tht bridge
And the told

With the brilliance
And the light
With the sting
And the hide
And the road ahead of you.

I can not tell a lie
It's not all cherry pie
But it's all there waiting for you
Yeah you

Hey you (hey you)
Hey you (hey you)
Hey you (hey you)
I know

With the walk
And the woods
And the southern fudge
There's an old look better and now

While i'm nothing but confused
With nothing left to lose
And if you buy that
I've got a bridge for you

Hey you (hey you)
Hey you (hey you)
Hey you (hey you)
I know

Hey you (hey you)
Hey you (hey you)
Hey you (hey you)
I know

Oh...

Every day is never good
Every day is yours to win
And that's how heroes are made

I wanted to win
So i've said it again:
That's how heroes are made

Hey you (hey you)
Hey you (hey you)
Hey you (hey you)
I know

Hey you (hey you)
Hey you (hey you)
Hey you (hey you)
I know

Ah...
