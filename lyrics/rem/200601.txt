From the inside room
When the front room greeting
Becomes your special book
It was simple then


When the party lulls
If we fall by the side
Will you be remembered?
Will she be remembered?

Alone in a crowd
A bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera
Then who will be your face?

I fell by your bed once
I didn't want to tell you
I should keep myself
In between the pages

Of the green light room
If we fall by the side
Will you be remembered?
Will she be remembered?

Alone in a crowd
A bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera
Then who will be your face?

From the inside room
When the front room greeting
Becomes your special book
It was simple then

When the party lulls
If we fall by the side
I still like you
Can you remember?

Alone in a crowd
A bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera
Then who will be your face?
