Old Man Kensey wants to be a sign painter
First he's got to learn to read
He's gonna be a clown on TV
Flags at his elbow, time to breath
(That's my folly) I believe


Drink up the lake, Kensey's away
(That's my folly) That's my mistake

Old Man Kensey wants to be a goalie
First he's got to learn to count
He's gonna be a clown on a circus mount
Letters to me signed in sopped up tar
(That's my folly) Kensey's going far

John, Bill and Ted, stand on your head
(That's my folly) I'm ready to go

Old Man Kensey wants to be a dog catcher
First he's got to learn to stand
He's gonna be a clown in a marching band
Letters to me signed ransom greed
(That's my folly) I believe

Drink up the lake, John, Bill and Ted,
(That's my folly) That's my mistake
Kensey's away, stand on your head
(That's my folly) I'm ready to go
Drink up the lake, stand on your head
(That's my folly) I'm ready to go
