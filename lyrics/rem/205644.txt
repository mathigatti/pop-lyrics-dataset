Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel just about everything
Lately I'm just feeling bad
Lately I'm just feeling bad


(chorus)
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

I thought of you as my mountain top
I thought of you as my peak
I thought of you as just about everything
I had but couldn't keep
I had but couldn't keep

(repeat chorus 3x)
