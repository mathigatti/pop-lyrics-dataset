This is not a parable
This is a terrible
This is a terrible thing


Yes I will rhyme that, after
After all I've done today
I have earned my wings

It happened today
Hooray!
Hooray!
It happened.
Hip, hip, hooray!

We'll leave the allegory to another Bible story
Out of deference, defiance and choice

Closing on a promise, after
After all I've done today
I have earned my voice

It happened today
Hooray!
Hooray!
It happened.
Hip, hip, hooray!
