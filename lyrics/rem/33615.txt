Nightswimming
Deserves a quiet night
The photograph on the dashboard
Taken years ago
Turned around, backwards, so the windshield shows
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Still, it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the waters edge
The moon is low tonight


Nightswimming
Deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
The recklessness in water
They cannot see me naked
These things, they go away
Replaced by every day
Nightswimming
Remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side, in orbit
Around the fairest sun
The bright tide that ever drawn
Could not describe
Nightswimming
You, I thought I knew you
You, I can not judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
Nightswimming

The photograph reflects
Every street light a reminder
Nightswimming
Deserves a quiet night
Deserves a quiet night
