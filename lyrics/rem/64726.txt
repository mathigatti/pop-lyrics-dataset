If we're talking about love
Then I have to tell you
Dear readers, I'm not sure where I'm headed.
I've gotten lost before.
I've woke up stone drunk
Face down in the floor.


Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a bore.
Everyone hates a drunk.

This may be a lit invention
Professors muddled in their intent
To try to rope in followers
To float their malcontent.
As for this reader,
I'm already spent.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a sad professor.
I hate where I wound up.

Dear readers, my apologies.
I'm drifting in and out of sleep.
Long silence presents the tragedies
Of love. Gote the age. get afraid.
The surface hazy with attendant thoughts.
A lazy eye metaphor on the rocks.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a bore.
Everyone hates a drunk.
Everyone hates a sad professor.
I hate where I wound up.
I hate where I wound up.
