You don't have to take the bar exam to see
What you've done is ignoramus 103
What've I got to hang my hat on
You don't have a pot to pee in
All this just to be your friend
I was there until the end.
Extortion and arson, petty larceny.I know you called-I know you called-I know you called
I know you called-I know you called-I know you hung up my line
Star 69I know all about the warehouse fire
I know squirrelys didn't chew the wires
3 people have my number
The other 2 were with me
I don't like to tell-tell but i'm not your patsy.
This time you have gone too far with me.I know you called-I know you called-I know you called
I know you called-I know you called-I know you hung up my line
Star 69Why'd you put your quarter down on me?
This reads like some dork inside edition hard copy.
I can't be your character witness
I can't be your alibi
Doorbell rings it's the FBI
We learned Spy vs. Spy
You my friend are guilty as can be.I know you called-I know you called-I know you called
I know you called-I know you called-I know you hung up my line
I know you called-I know you called-I know you called
I know you called-I know you called-I can't be your alibi
Star 69
