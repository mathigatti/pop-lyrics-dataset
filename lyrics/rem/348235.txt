Makin' a livin' the old hard way
Takin' and givin' by day by day
I dig snow and rain and the bright sunshine
Draggin' The Line


My dog Sam eats purple flowers
Ain't got much, but what we got's ours
We dig snow and rain and the bright sunshine
Draggin' The Line
(Draggin' The Line)
Draggin' The Line
(Draggin' The Line)

I feel fine, I'm talkin' 'bout peace of mind
I'm gonna take my time, I'm gettin' the good sign
Draggin' The Line
(Draggin' The Line)
Draggin' The Line
(Draggin' The Line)

Lovin' the free and feelin spirit of
hugging a tree
when you get near it.
Diggin' snow and rain and the bright sunshine
Draggin' The Line
(Draggin' The Line)
Draggin' The Line
(Draggin' The Line)
