Salt Lake City, come in spring over the salt flats.
A hailstorm brought you back to me.

Here it comes (I'm carried away)
Here it comes (I'm carried away)
Here it comes, bad.

Departure, godspeed, bless his heart, good lord.
What a fuck-up, what a fighter.
Free-fall, motorcycle, hang-glider,
Hung on the line like a poison spider.
Win a eulogy from William Greider,
car crash, ptomaine, disposable lighter,
a bus plunge, avalanche, RV, vinegar cider.
Free-fall, motorcycle, hang-glider.

Go, go, go, go, yeah.

Well, everybody is young forever.
There's so much to tell you, so little time.
I've come a long way since, uh, whatever,
shit, I still see that word and think of you.
There is so much that I can't do, yeah.
You will be young forever.
There is so much that I can't do.
