(chorus 1)
This mellow, sweet, short-haired boy, woman offers pull up a
seat
Take in one symphony now, we've just begun to battle
Wrap your heel in bones of steel, turn the leg, a twist of color
Autumn waited hold it to you in the colored come another


(chorus 2)
Seven chinese brothers swallowing the ocean
Seven thousand years to sleep away the pain
She will return, she will return

(repeat chorus 1)

(repeat chorus 2)

This mellow, sweet, short-haired boy, woman offers pull up a
chair
Take in one symphony now, I guess we lost that battle
Wrap your heel in bones of steel, turn the leg, a twist of color
Autumn waded seven seas swimming colored come 

Seven chinese brothers swallowing the ocean
Seven thousand years the Communi did reign
She will return, she will return
