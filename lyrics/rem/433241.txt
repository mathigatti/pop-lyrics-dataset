(chorus 1)
There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Michael's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right


(chorus 2)
There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right

(repeat chorus 1)

(repeat chorus 2)

There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's going to say goodnight
There's something going on that's not quite right
