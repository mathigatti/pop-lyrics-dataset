Keys cut, three for the price of one
Nothing's free but guaranteed for a lifetime's use
I've changed the locks
And you can't have one
You, you know the other two


The brakes have worn so thin that you could hear,
I hear them screeching through the door from our driveway
Hey love, look into your glovebox heart
What is there for me inside? This love is tired
I've changed the locks. Have I misplaced you?
Have we lost our minds?
Will this never end?
It could depend on your take

You, me, we used to be on fire
If keys are all that stand between,
Can I throw in the ring?
No gasoline
Just fuck me kitten
You are wild and I'm in your possesion
Nothing's free so, fuck me kitten

I'm in your possesion
So, fuck me kitten
