I've been lost inside my head
Echoes fall of me
I took the prize last night for complicated mess
For saying things I didn't mean and don't believe


Believe in me, believe in nothing
Corner me and make me something
I've become the hollow man, have
I've become the hollow man, I see?

Hmm... I see? This echoing
You had placed your trust in me
I went upside down
I emptied up the room
Thirty seconds left
I can't believe
You held your ground

Believe in me, believe in nothing
Corner me and make me something
I've become the hollow man have
I've become the hollow man, I see?

I'm overwhelmed, I'm on repeat
I'm emptied out, I'm incompleted
Trust in me I want to show you
I don't want to be the hollow man

Believe in me, believe in nothing
Corner me and make me something
I've become the hollow man, have
I've become the hollow man, I see
I see
