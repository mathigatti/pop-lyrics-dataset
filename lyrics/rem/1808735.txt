The kids have a new take
A new take on faith
Pick up the pieces
Get carried away
I came home to city half erased
I came home to face what we faced


This place needs me here to start
This place is the beat of my heart

Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)
Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)

Storm didn't kill me
The government changed
Hear the answer call
Hear the song rearranged
Hear the tress, the ghosts and the buildings sing
With the wisdom to reconcile this thing

It's sweet and it's sad and it's true
How it doesn't look bitter on you

Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)
Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)

Mother and father
I stand beside you
The good of this world
Might help see me through

This place needs me here to start
This place is the beat of my heart

Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)
Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)
