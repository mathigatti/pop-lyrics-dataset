Your eyes are burning holes through me
I'm gasoline
I'm burnin'n clean


Twentieth century, go and sleep
You''re plasticine
That is obscene
That is obscene

But you are the star tonight,
You shine electric outta sight
Your light eclipsed the moon tonight
Electrolite
You're outta sight

If I ever want to fly
Muholland drive
Up in the sky

Hollywood is under me
I'm Martin Sheen
I'm Steve McQueen
I'm Jimmy Dean

But you are the star tonight
You shine electric outta sight
Your light eclipsed the moon tonight
Electrolite
You're outta sight

If you ever want to fly
Muholland drive
You are alive

Stand on a cliff and look down there
Don't be scared
You are alive
You are alive

But you are the star tonight
You shine electric outta sight
Your light eclipsed the moon tonight
Electrolite
You're outta sight

Twentieth century go and sleep
Really deep
We won't blink

Your eyes are burnin' holes through me
I'm not scared
I'm out of here
I'm not scared
I'm out of here
