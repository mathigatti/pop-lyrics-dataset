They call me the apologist
And now that I'm at peak
You know at first it really hurt
We joke about these things
I've skirted all my differences
But now I'm facing up
I wanted to apologize for
Everything I was, so
I'm sorry, so sorry


Did you understand me right?
The people here are good
They tell me what I shlould have done
And offer what I could
I'm good, all is good
All's well, no complaints
When I feel regret
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm sorry, so sorry

I live a simple life
Unfettered by complex sweets
You think this isn't me?
Don't be weak
There I go
I'm so sorry

Thank you for being there for me
Thank you for listening, goodbye
I can forfeit selfishness
I hope for you that you apply
This happiness
This peacefullness
I'm sorry, so sorry

I live a simple life
Unfettered by complex sweets
You think this isn't me?
That's so sweet
I'm so sorry
