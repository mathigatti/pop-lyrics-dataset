I will try not breathe
I can hold my head still with my hands at my knees
These are the eyes of the old
Shiver and fold


I will try not to breathe
This decision is mine
I have lived a full life And these are the eyes that I want you to remember

I need something to fly over my grave again
I need something to breathe

I will try not to burden you
I can hold these inside
I will hold my breath
Until all these shivers subside
Just look in my eyes

I will try not to worry you
I have seen things that you will never see
Leave it to memory me
I shudder to breathe

I want you to remember (You will never see)
I need something to fly (Something to fly)
Over my grave again (You will never see)
I need something to breathe (Something to breathe)
Baby don't shiver now
Why do you shiver now? (I will see things you will never see)
I need something to fly (Something to fly)
Over my grave again (I will see things you will never see)
I need something to breathe

I will try not to worry you.
I have seen things you will never see
Leave it to memory me
Don't dare me to breathe

I want you to remember (You will never see)
I need something to fly (Something to fly)
Over my grave again (You will never see)
I need something to breathe (Something to breathe)
Baby don't shiver now
Why do you shiver now? (I will see things you will never see)
I need something to fly (Something to fly)
Over my grave again (I will see things you will never see)
I need something to breathe (Something to breathe - I have seenthings you will never see)
I want you to remember
