You got your problems darling 
I got mine too 
You know that 
maybe it's time for you to come through 
Because I'm fed up with waiting for you 
Won't you decide real fast 
what are you gonna do? 


I've almost given up hope 
then what else is new? 
You know that 
I'm at the end of my rope trying to hang on to you 
Because my patience is wearing thin just waiting for you 
Won't you decide real fast 
what are you gonna do 

You better wait (WAIT!) 
Don't go away now darling, wait (WAIT) 
Why don't you stay? 
You better wait (WAIT!) 
Don't go away now, wait (WAIT!) 
Why don't you stay? 

I know that you're confused 
it's no crime 
You better hurry Sugar 
cuz we're running out of time 
Because my patience is wearing thin just waiting for you 
Won't you decide real fast 
what are you gonna do? 

chorus 

I don't wanna walk on the same stage with you 
Then the bells begin to blow in my head 
If things don't turn out right 
It's gonna be all right
