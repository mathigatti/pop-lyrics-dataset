Boy In The Wall

Look at this, it's me, walking away.
Look at you drowning, on display.
Every time i've dropped by, i've tried to say
The water is rising.
You don't want to stay.


It's that sinking feeling. You know what it's bringing on.
You might as well say it,
I see it, i feel it.
This town is going wrong.
It's turning away.

You wanted me to be someone that i could never be
My new friends are offering things i've never dreamed
It's beautiful,
I'd like for them to take me on...

The track mall gang went off
On the tennessee goth. A lunar moth,
You chrysalis and flail.
The water is rising. You try to rappel.
A rousing cheer for the boy in the well.

It's that sinking feeling. You know what it's bringing on.
You might as well say it,
I see it, i feel it.
This town is going wrong.
It's turning away.

You wanted me to be someone that i could never be
My new friends are offering things i've never dreamed
It's beautiful,
I'd like for them to take me on...

Here is where i look back.
Here is where you fell.
This is where i got up,
Shaking off my tail
This is where your rope trick
Started to look stale.
A greyhound pass for the boy in the well.

It's that sinking feeling
You know what it's bringing on
I might as well say it.
I see it, i feel it
This town is going wrong.
It's turning away.

You wanted me to be someone that i could never be
My new friends are offering things i've never dreamed
It's beautiful,
I'd like for them to take me on

You wanted me to be something that i could never be
My new friends are offering things i've never dreamed
It's beautiful,
I'd like for them to take me on
