Scratch the scandals in the twilight 
Trying to shock but instead 
Idle hands all orient to her 
Pass a magic pillow under head 
It's so much more attractive inside the moral kiosk 
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight 
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight 


They scratch the scandals in the twilight 
She was laughing like a Horae 
Put that knee in dour landslide 
Take this step to dash a roving eye 
It's so much more attractive inside the moral kiosk 
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight 
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight
