Hello, I saw you, I know you, I knew you
I think I can remember your name...name
Hello, I'm sorry, I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else


Should we talk about the weather
Should we talk about the government

Hello, how are you? I know you, I knew you
I think I can remember your name...name
Hello, I'm sorry I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else

Should we talk about the weather
Should we talk about the government

Hello my friend, are you visible today
You know I never knew that it could be so strange...strange
Hello, I'm sorry, I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else

Should we talk about the weather
Should we talk about the government
