LYNNE: Wha-haa? (Pauses, then changes tone.) Why Memphis? 

ANDY: Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the 
world. I'll get up in the ring, and I'll announce that the 
I'll marry the FIRST woman who beats me. Then you can get up, 
and we'll wrestle, and I'll let you win, and ... 


LYNNE: You'll let me win? (laughs.) 

ANDY: ... yes, I'll let you win. I'll let you. Then we'll run 
off and get married on the David Letterman show.
