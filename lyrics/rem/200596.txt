Baby, I don't want to be seen with you
Baby, I got better things to do
Baby, I don't wanna hang around with you
Baby, I got better things to do


Cause I know you're out with other guys
Well I know you're goin' to tell me lies

Baby, I should have held you when I had the chance
Baby, I could have blew it when I never learned how to dance

Well I know you're out with other guys
And I know you're gonna tell me lies

I wait at home every night
I never leave on my back porch light
I'm hoping you won't come back
Cause if you do I'll wanna die

Baby, I don't wanna hang around with you
Baby, I got better things to do
Well, I know you're out with other guys
Well, I you're gonna tell me lies

Baby, I should have held you when I had the chance
Baby, I blew it when I never learned how to dance
Well, I know you're out with other guys
And I know you're gonna tell me lies

Baby, I
