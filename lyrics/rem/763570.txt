I was beamed aboard the Starship Enterprise
What I felt what I saw was a total surprise
I looked around and wondered can this be
Or is this the start of my insanity


Oh but its true
As we went warp factor 2
And I met all of the crew
Where's Captain Kirk

I went to the bridge and we were tossed about
In the storm of a vortex i was hit with a doubt
I saw in a dream in a memory of mine
Was it you was it me who was in all the time

Spock pulled me through
As we went warp factor 2
and someone I saw I knew
Who's Captain Kirk

So when I awoke from the dangers of space
I looked and i saw a familiar face
The time warp in space made a change in me
For I was the captain and the Captain was me

Yes its so true
as we went warp factor 2
The changes I have been through
As Captain Kirk
I'm captain Kirk

Oh its so true
As we went warp factor 2
The changes I have been through
As Captain Kirk
I'm Captain Kirk

Where's spock
