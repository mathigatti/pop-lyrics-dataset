The world is an oyster, the bitter refrain
The lord is my shepherd, i cannot stay
This blessed earth, this beautiful land
A new day that breaks the dawn


I am the tide, the oceans sing
I am the anchor, i hold the brass ring
I am the action, the deed of our king
I am the static goodnight

You make me to stand in the square on scene
And make my choice, decision sing
And bring my lord, what this may bring
I stand before you alone

I rallied and sang and shouted refrains
I'm blessed, turn the radio on
The air was calm
I held the bomb and the radio, the radio

Hallelu, hallelu, hallelujah

Hallelu, hallelu, hallelujah
Hallelu, hallelu, hallelujah
Hallelu, hallelu, hallelujah
Hallelu, hallelu, hallelujah
