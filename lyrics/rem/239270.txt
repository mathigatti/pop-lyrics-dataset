It's what I want, hurry and buy,
all has been tried, follow reason and buy,
Cannot shuffle in this heat, it's all wrong
Try to put that on your sleeve it's all wrong it's all wrong


He's got a pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
God damn, pure confusion
She's got pretty persuasion

It's what I want, hurry and buy,
all has been tried, follow reasoning,
And I put that in this heat it's all wrong
Try to wear that on my sleeve it's all wrong all wrong

He's got a pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
God damn, pure confusion
He's got pretty persuasion

In the light I saw
quite a scene there

It's what I want, hurry and buy,
all has been tried, follow reason and buy,
Try to put that in this heat it's all wrong
Cannot wear that on your sleeve it's all wrong it's all wrong
