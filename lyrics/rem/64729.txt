I watched you fall.
I think I pushed.
maybe I'm crazy
maybe diminished
maybe I'm innocent
maybe I'm finished
maybe I blacked out.
how do I play this?


I will give my best today
I will give myself away
I have never hurt anythig
is the jury wavering?
do they know I sing?

maybe I'm crazy
maybe diminished
how do I,
how do I play this?
jealous lover, self defense
protective brother, chemical
dependence.
I'll consult the i-ching
I'll consult the tv
ouija, oblique strategies.
I'll consult the law books for
precedents.
can I charm the jury?

I will give my best today
I will give myself away
I have never hurt anything
is the justice wavering?
does she know I sing
that song?
sing along
sing along
sing along
(I will never hurt anything]

I watched you fall.
maybe they'll see me,
maybe they'll say,
"I can see the truth in his statement.
smallpox blanket? no way."
can I charm the jury, my defense?
maybe I'm crazy
maybe I'm diminished
maybe I loved you
baby I loved you
baby I loved you
baby I loved you
baby I'm finished.

I will give my best today
I will give myself away
I have never hurt anything
is the justice wavering?
does she know I sing
that song?
sing along
sing along
sing along
(I will never hurt anything)
I have given myself away
I have given my best today
I have never hurt anything
is the justice wavering?
does she know I loved you
does she know I loved you?
does she know I sing?
