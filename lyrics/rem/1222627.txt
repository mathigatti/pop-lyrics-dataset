Sinking fast 
The weight chained to my feet
No time to argue with belief
I'm not alone 
A thousand others dropping
Faster than me
What put me here?
Nothing to hold on to
Nowhere to brake


Where is the ripcord 
The trapdoor, the key?
Where is the cartoon 
Escape-hatch for me?
No time to question 
The choices I make
I've got to follow 
Another direction 
(Although fall down 
is much cooler)

The last thing I remember 
Was climbing up the stairs
I threw the window open 
In challenge and despair
I don't know what I needed
I needed time
I needed to escape
I saw the future turn
Upside-down and hesitate

Where is the ripcord 
The trapdoor, the key?
Where is the cartoon 
Eescape-hatch for me?
No time to question 
The choices I make
I've got to follow 
Another direction

Accelerate

The vista 
I see now 
Is changing
Uncertainty 
Is suffocating
Our hope 
Has never felt 
So great 
And lit up down
A pounding pulse
To make it go
Make it slow down
Go

Where is the ripcord 
The trapdoor, the key?
Where is the cartoon 
Escape-hatch for me?
No time to question 
The choices I make
I've got to follow 
Another direction

The city's burning 
It's like 
It's ready to explode
Accelerate 
To make it slow
Make it go
Accelerate 
To make it slow
Make it go
I'm incomplete
I'm incomplete
I'm incomplete
