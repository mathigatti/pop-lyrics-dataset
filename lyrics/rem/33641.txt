Josie and the Pussycats
Long tails and ears for hats
Guitars and Marshall stacks
Hot, sweet, super cool
Don't ya know these kitties rule


Hurry, hurry
We've been going over the master plan
Driving in our custom printed van
Practicing for hours
Don't you know that
Soon no matter where you go
We'll be on your radio

Josie and the Pussyats
Hot licks, we'll give ya that
Stone foxes, that's a fact
Josie and the Pussycats

Even though we're playin' in our garage
Soon we'll have a massive entourage
Goin' triple platinum
You'll just watch us climbin' up the Bilboard Charts
Breakin' records, breakin' hearts
Let's go!

Josie and the Pussycats
Long tails and ears for hats
We know just where it's at
East, west, north, or south
Guaranteed to rock the house
Josie and the Pussycats
Josie and the Pussycats
