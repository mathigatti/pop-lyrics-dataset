Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall 
Take oasis, Marat's bathing 
We walk through the wood we walk 
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall 
Take oasis, Marat's bathing 
We walk through the woods we walk 
Take oasis take oasis take oasis take oasis 
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall 
Take oasis, Marat's bathing 
We walk through the world we walk 
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall 
Take oasis, Marat's bathing 
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall 
Take oasis, Marat's bathing 
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall 
Into the hall
