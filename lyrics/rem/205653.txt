Ask the girl of the hour by the water tower's watch
If your friends took a fall, are you obligated to follow


(chorus)
Time after, time after time

When the bull's on his hooves, when you gather friends by the
tower
If you try to refuse, will they judge your worth by the hour?

(repeat chorus)

Time after, time after

If your tired and you're tried you can find me in my room
You can stay if you want and the third time you can't lose

(repeat chorus 2x)

Ask the girl of the hour, by the water tower's watch
We can fight if you want but who will turn out the light

(repeat chorus 3x)

Time after, Time after
