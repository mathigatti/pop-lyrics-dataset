20,000 miles to an oasis
20,000 years will I burn
20,000 chances I've wasted
Waiting for the moment to turn


I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

Walking through the woods, I have faced it
Looking for something to learn
30, 000 thoughts have been wasted
Never in my time to return

I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

All my life
Waiting to find

40,000 stars in the evening
Look at them fall from the sky
40,000 reasons for living
40,000 tears in your eyes

I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

Catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall
