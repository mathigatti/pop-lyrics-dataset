Windout - if you're out of wind
Windout - if you're really spent
Windout - if you're young and red


(chorus)
Yeah, tick tock, it's tine o'clock
Once is good enough, you really go

So find out - if you're really spent
Find out - if you're out of wind
Windout - if you're out of sin

(repeat chorus)

Winding up

There's no doubt - that you're feeling fine
No doubt - that you're out of mind
No doubt - that you're young and red

Windout - if you're really spent
Find out - if you're young and red
Windout - if you're out of wind
If you're young and red

Tick tock, time to clock my band
Once is good enough, you really go

Windout, find out, no doubt
Windout, find out, no doubt
Windout, windout, windout
