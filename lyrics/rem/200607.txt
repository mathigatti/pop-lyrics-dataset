These are dangerous times
Nothing to care or die for
These are dangerous times
What you want, someone will buy for you


Don't get away

It's so easy to wait
You've been wearing the green
I've been wearing the fall
And you said that all was just agreed

(chorus)
Don't get away
Don't get away

I saw a guy out on the street
Said, I know what you need, boy
I can set you fine
I didn't buy his line, because

These are dangerous times
I don't want to get old
You say that everything's fine
Then you leave me standing in the cold

(repeat chorus)

It's so easy to fall
You've been trying to gain
I've been trying to stop
But it's catching up with me again

(repeat chorus)

These are dangerous times
It's a dangerous time

Don't get away (it's a dangerous time)
Don't get away (it's a dangerous time)
Don't get away (it's a dangerous time)
