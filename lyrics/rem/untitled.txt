This world is big (this world is big)
And so awake (and so awake)
I stayed up late (I stayed up late)
To hear your voice
This light is here (this light is here)
To keep you warm (to keep you warm)
This song is here (this song is here)
To keep you strong


(I made a list) I made a list
(Of things to say) of things to say
But all I want to say (but all I want)
All I really want to say is
(Yes, all I want)

(I made a list) hold her
(Of things to say) and keep him strong
(But all I want) while I'm away from here
(Yes, all I want)
(This world is big) hold her
(And so alone) and keep her strong
(I stayed up late) while I'm away from here
(To hear your voice)
(This light is here) hold him
(To keep you warm) and him strong
(This song is here) while I'm away from here
(To keep you strong)

I've seen the world and so awake (keep him strong)
And stay up late to hear me sing
Just hold her
I've seen the world and so awake (keep him strong)
And stay up late to hear me sing
Just hold him

(I've seen the world) hold her
(And so awake) and keep her strong
(So stay awake) while I'm away from here
(To hear me sing)
(I've seen the world) and hold him
(And so awake) and keep him strong
(So stay awake) while I'm away from here
(To hear me sing)
