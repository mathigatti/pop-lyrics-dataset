Easy to poke yourself square in the eye
Harder to like yourself, harder to try
These Elvis poses, postcards and neopryn
Roses a dollar a stem
Everyone's sleeping or pulling a long haul,
the keys in the cooler, it's 3 A.M.


and Saturn is beckoning no one
is off on its own
is offering up

Late shift convenience store
Cut out the lights
Telescope roof towards the
northwestern sky
You pull the ladder up
no one's the wiser
You find your sights and discover

that Saturn is orbiting nothing
is off on its own
is breaking from home.

Harder to look yourself square in the eye
Easy to take off.

You found the ladder in the pattern of your wrist
You've seen and you've marked horizons
Mother was difficult she made you cry
Cover the mirror, look at the sky
You climb into your rocketship triumph
Lift up and hold out your hands.

Saturn is orbiting nothing
is off on its own
is breaking from home.

Saturn is orbiting nothing
is off on its own
is breaking from home.

Saturn return when you chase down its moons
Throw them into a new gravity.

Harder to look yourself square in the eye
Easy to poke yourself, easy as pie
Easy to take off, harder to fly
Harder to wake Galileo.
