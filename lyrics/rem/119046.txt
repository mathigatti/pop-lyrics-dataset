Here comes that awful feeling again
Welcome the ugly animal
I hold my breath to watch you swing,
My high rope acrobat ball and chain,
I'm not afraid, I messed it, messed it, messed it, messed it up


I've got my telescope head in the haystack
I'm getting tired of your dodgeball circus act
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark on command

Here comes that awful feeling again
Make way for monster jealousy
The strong man kicked sand into my breakfast cereal bowl
I'd spelled your name with Oatios,
He messed it, messed it, messed it, messed it up

I've got my telescope head in the haystack
I am tired of your dodgeball circus act
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark on command

(You're mean, mean, mean
You tease, tease, tease me)

If I were you I'd really run from me
I'd really, really wish that I were you
When I get loose, I'll climb a tree
And drop a load on your head
This monster in me makes me retch, you messed it, messed it up

I've got my telescope head in the haystack
I am jealous of your dodgeball circus act
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark on command

(You're mean, mean, mean
You tease, tease, tease me)

Do you smell jealousy?
Do you smell jealousy, jealousy, jealousy?
