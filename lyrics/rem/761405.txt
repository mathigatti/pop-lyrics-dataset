Here she comes you better watch your step
She's going to play you for a fool it's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She'll build you up to just put you down
What a clown


Cause everybody knows the things she does to please
She's just a little tease
See the way she walks hear the way she talks

You're written in her book
You're number thirty-seven have a look
She's going to play you for a fool it's true
Little boy on the street
Before you start you're already beat
She's going to smile to make you frown
What a clown

Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks hear the way she talks
