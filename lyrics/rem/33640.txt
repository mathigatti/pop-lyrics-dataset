I sit at my table
And wage war on myself
It seems like it's all for nothing
I know the barricades
And I know the mortar in the wall breaks
I recognise the weapons
I've used them well


This is my mistake
Let me make it good
I raised the wall
and I will be the one to knock it down

I've a rich understanding of my finest defences
I proclaim that claims are left unstated
I demand a rematch
I decree a stalemate
I divine my deeper motives
I recognise the weapons
I've practised them well
I fitted them myself
It's amazing what devices you can sympathise
Empathise
This is my mistake
Let me make it good
I raised the wall
and I will be the one to knock it down

Reach out for me
Hold me tight
Hold that memory
Let my machine talk to me
Let my machine talk to me

This is my world
And I am the World Leader Pretend
This is my life, and this is my time
I have been given the freedom to do as I see fit
It's high time I razed the walls that I've constructed

It's amazing what devices you can sympathise
Empathise
This is my mistake
Let me make it good
I raised the wall
And I will be the one to knock it down

You fill in the mortar
You fill in the harmony
You fill in the mortar
I raised the wall
And I'm the only one
I will be the one to knock it down
