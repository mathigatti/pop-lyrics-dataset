Divide your cultured pearls and paste
I'm looking for to lay to waste
Of all the things I cannot taste
and this not the racy race
They spoke loud


I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you
It's what you do

I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do
I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do

Given the choice
Given the heart
Given the tool
Given the word
Given the cheers

I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you
It's what you do

I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do
I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do
