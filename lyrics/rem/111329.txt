Take a turn, take a turn 
Take our fortune, take our fortune 


They called the clip a two-headed cow 
Your hate clipped and distant, your luck, pilgrimage 
Rest assured this will not last, take a turn for the worst 
Your hate clipped and distant, your luck a two-headed cow 
The pilgrimage has gained momentum 
Take a turn, take a turn 
Take our fortune, take our fortune 

Speakin' in tongues, it's worth a broken lip 
Your hate clipped and distant, your luck, pilgrimage 
Rest assured this will not last, take a turn for the worst 
Your hate clipped and distant, your luck a two-headed cow 
The pilgrimage has gained momentum 
Take a turn, take a turn 
Take our fortune, take our fortune 

Pilgrimage. Pilgrimage.
