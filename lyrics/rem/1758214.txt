I'm so glad I've found this
I'm so glad I did
I'm so glad I've found this
I'm so glad I did
People are fragile things, you should know by now
Be careful what you put them through
People are fragile things, you should know by now
You'll speak when you're spoken to


It breaks when you don't force it
It breaks when you don't try
It breaks if you don't force it
It breaks if you don't try, try, try, try

People are fragile things, you should know by now
Be careful what you put them through
People are fragile things, you should know by now
You'll speak when you're spoken to
With one hand you calm me
With one hand I'm still
With one hand you calm me
With one hand I'm still, still, still, still
People are fragile things, you should know by now
Be careful what you put them through
People are fragile things, you should know by now
You'll speak when you're spoken to
People are fragile things, you should know by now
Be careful what you put them through
People are fragile things, you should know by now
You'll speak when you're spoken to
Ahhhh
You'll speak when you're spoken to
You'll speak when you're spoken to
He'll speak when he's spoken to
She'll speak when she's spoken to.
