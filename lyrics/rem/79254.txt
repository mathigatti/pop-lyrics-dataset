Reverend Bill Funderburk sings "He Cared That Much For Me";
Charles Surratt introduces his own composition "On Calvary For Me";
"The Joy of Knowing Jesus" is a song of pure delight featuring John Barbee;The pure tenor quality of the voice of Harold Montgomery
gives a special interpretation to the grand old hymn "The Old Rugged Cross";
Chill bumps appear and I am frozen in the web they weave as they reveal their
innermost selves with the outpouring of their hearts...On and on the songs roll and soon you are caught up
in the sermon in each rendition as you come to feel
the devotion and dedication that is poured forth.
Suddenly, you know they are real, they mean it!"Let your light so shine..."
could not be more aptly applied
as there shines a light from heaven on your heart
through their singing. As an artist, Rhonda Montgomery
exemplifies piano artistry. That's Rhonda! An artist!This album can be the instrument to mend a broken heart
or to straighten out your life through the sincere testimony
in the songs of THE REVELAIRES. A must!J. Elmo Fagg, founder and leader
