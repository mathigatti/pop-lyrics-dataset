We had an apartment in the city
Me and Loretta liked to live there 
It's been years since kids have grown 
All lives of their own


John and Linda live in Omaha
Joey's somewhere on the road 
We lost Jony in the Korean war
I still don't know what for
Don't matter any more 

Chorus: Old trees grow stronger 
And old rivers grow wider everyday
But old people they just grow lonesome 
Waiting for someone to say 
Say hello in there ..say hello 

Me and Loretta we don't talk much now 
She sits and stares at the back door screen
All the news just repeat yourself 
Like some forgotten dream the we've both seen  

Someday I'll go and call up Rudy
We worked together at the factory 
But what'll I teel him when he asks what's news?
Say not wht's whit you there's nothin' much to do 

So if you walking down the street oneday 
Spot some hollow ancient eyes 
Don't turn around as if you din't care or you stop and stare 
Say hello in there 
Say hello ...
