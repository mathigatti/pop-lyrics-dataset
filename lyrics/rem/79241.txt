Her world collapsed early Sunday morning
She got up from the kitchen table
Folded the newspaper and silenced the radio
Those creatures jumped the barricades
And have headed for the sea
Sea


Those creatures jumped the barricades
And have headed for the sea
She began to breathe
To breathe at the thought of this freedom
Stood and whispered to her child
Belong
She held the child and whispered
With calm, calm
Belong

Stood and whispered to her child
Belong
She held the child and whispered
With calm, calm
Belong

These barricades can only hold for so long
Her world collapsed early Sunday morning
She took the child
Held tight
Opened the window
A breath
This song
How long
And knew, knew
Belong
