Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier but smarter too, smarter too
All along the tomb, all along the ruin
Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier but smarter too, smarter too


I could live a million, I could live a million, I could live a
million,
I could live a million years

All along, all along, all along the tomb
Secret in, secret in, secret in the ruin
Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier but smarter too, smarter too
