(chorus)
Postcard stowaway within
Pristine indigo without
Banded ottoman as such
Sofa seated one too much
All along the range, all along the range
Ages of you
Ages of you
Ages of you


(repeat chorus)

Train pulls over hanging bridge
Conductor looks up, thinks
Out and down, hands stuck to the left
To the right, you should fall,
The horses just don't gossip anymore

(repeat chorus)

Ages of you
Ages of you
Ages of you
