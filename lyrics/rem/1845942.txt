Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
What, what would you
Have had me say
Instead of what i said


Where, where would i go
How could i follow that
Except to do what i did

Which it's to
Walk it back
Walk it back
Hmmm... walk it back

Time reversing me why
Erasing me vice
And tried to start again

You, don't you turn this around
I have not touch the ground in
I don't know how long

You say to
Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Hmmm... walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back

Time, time, time it cannot revive
You, you can't turn away
You asked me to stay
But something needs to change

Why can't you
Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Hmmm... walk it back
