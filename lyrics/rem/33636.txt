I know you
I know you've seen her
She's a sad tomato
She's three miles of bad road
Walking down the street
Will I never meet her?
She's a real woman-child
Oh my kiss breath turpentine


I am smitten
I'm the real thing (I'm the real thing)
Have you seen her come around?
My crush with eyeliner

I'm in like
I'm infatuated
It's all too much pressure
She's all that I can take
What position should I wear?
Cop an attitude? (You faker)
How can I convince her? (Faker)
That I'm invented, too, yeah

I am smitten
I'm the real thing (I'm the real thing)
We all invent ourselves
And you know me

She's a sad tomato
She's three miles of bad road
She's her own invention (She's her own invention)
That gets me in the throat
What can I make myself be?
Life is strange, yeah (Life is strange)
What can I make myself be? (Fake her)
To make her mine?

I am smitten
I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
A kiss breath turpentine
My crush with eyeliner

I am smitten
You know me (Yeah, you know me)
I could be your Frankenstein
My crush with eyeliner

I am smitten
I'm the real thing (I'm the real thing)
Won't you be my valentine?
My crush with eyeliner
