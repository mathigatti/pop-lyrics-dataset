Baby just one sweet kiss, 
Honey from your sweet lips 
Baby just one sweet kiss, 
Honey from your sweet lips 
That's all I want, that's all I need
I'm satisfied


Baby just one of your smiles
You know makes it all worthwhile 
Baby just one of your smiles
You know makes it all worthwhile 

We could go walking down the lane 
Together hand in hand
But you think 
That it's gonna rain 
We'll stay at home 
And listen to the band 

Baby just one sweet kiss
Honey from your sweet lips 
Baby just one of your smiles
You know makes it all worthwhile

That's all I want, that's all I need
I'm satisfied
