Early in the morning and I can't get right
Had a little date with my baby last night
Now it's early in the morning (Early in the morning)
Well it's early in the morning (Early in the morning)
Now it's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues


Went to all the places where we used to go
Went to your house but you don't live there no more
Now it's early in the morning (Early in the morning)
Well it's early in the morning (Early in the morning)
Early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues

Went to your friend's house but she was out
Knock on your father's door and he began to shout Get out there boy
Early in the morning (Early in the morning)
Early in the morning (Early in the morning)
Early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues

Went to Dooky Chase to get something to eat
Waiter looked at me and said 'You sure look beat'
Now it's early in the morning (Early in the morning)
Early in the morning (Early in the morning)
Well it's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues
Well it's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues
Well it's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues
