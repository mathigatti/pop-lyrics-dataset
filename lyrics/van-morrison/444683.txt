Don't ya know, don't ya know
That it hurts to be treated like a fool?
A don't ya know, don't ya know
That it's mean and it's oh so cruel?


When you said you were home
It was just a lie 
You were seen on the town
With another guy
Gonna break my heart in two
Oh baby don't ya know?

A don't ya know, don't ya know
That your cheatin's breakin' us apart?
A don't ya know, don't ya know
That you'll tear my soul apart?
Why must you go foolin' 'round every other boy
And just push me away like a broken toy
Baby feel so bad inside, oh baby don't ya know?

Oh don't ya know, don't ya know
It's a foolish thing that you do? 
A don't ya know, don't ya know
It could easily turn on you?
'Cause they say it's a game only one can play
And you might be the one to get hurt someday
It could be your turn to cry
Oh baby don't ya know?

Oh don't ya know oh oh baby
Don't ya know?

You're gonna get hurt some day-a-a-a-yeah-yeah, yeah
