When you found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then that I never could
But time has taken all my pain away
Until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day


Once a day, all day long
And once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish that you weren't gone
Is once a day, every day, all day long

And I'm so glad I'm not like a friend that I knew one time
He lost the one he loved and then he slowly lost his mind
Sat around and cried his life away
Lucky me I'm only hurtin' once a day

Once a day, all day long
And once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish that you weren't gone
Once a day, every day, all day long

Once a day, all day long
And once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish that you weren't gone
Is once a day, every day, all day long
Once a day, every day, all day long
Once a day, every day, all day long
