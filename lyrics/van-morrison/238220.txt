The more I'm with you pretty baby
The more I feel my love increase
I'm building all my dreams around you
My happiness will never cease
But nothing's any good without you
Cause baby you're my centrepiece


I buy a house and garden somewhere
Along a country road a piece
A little cottage on the outskirts
Where we can really find release
But nothing's any good without you
Cause baby you're my centrepiece

Hey baby come and go

[Repeat first and second verse]
