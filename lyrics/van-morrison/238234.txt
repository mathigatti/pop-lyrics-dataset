I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting on that shore
To hear the cry for home
You won't have to worry anymore
When you hear the cry for home


When you hear, hear the call
You won't have to fake at all
Hear the cry for home

I'll be standing
I'll be standing within reach
When you hear, hear the call

I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting in the breach
For you, when you hear

When you hear, hear the call
You won't have to fake at all
Hear the cry for home

[Instrumental]

When I listen
When I listen to the song
Well it feels, it feels so free

And you tell me
You will come and go with me
When you hear the cry for home

When you hear the call
You won't have to think at all
Hear the cry for home
spoken (one more, one more time)
When you hear, hear the call
You won't have to fake at all
Hear the cry for home
(One more open it up, open it up) (spoken)
When you hear, hear the call
You won't have to fake at all
Hear the cry for home
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)
