I'm a real gone lover
I'm hip, I'm in the know
I'm a real gone lover
I'm hip, I'm in the know
And if ya love me one time
You'll soon come back for more


Come over to my pad
Come over to my pad and play
Come over to my pad
Come over to my pad and play
Like the old saying goes
When sunshines, let's make hay

Well, I'm a nervous fella (he's a nervous fella)
I'm a nervous fella (he's a nervous fella)
I'm a little-little nervous fella
(He's a nervous fella)
I'm a little-little nervous fella
(He's a nervous fella)
I'm a nervous fella
Don't make me wait all night

I'm a real gone lover
I'm hip, I'm in the know
(Sing it with me)
I'm a real gone lover
I'm hip, I'm in the know
And if ya love me one time
You'll soon come back for more
(Come on over babe)

Come over to my pad
Come over to my pad and play
(Come on over)
Come over to my pad
Come over to my pad and play
(Come over baby) (ooo, I'm comin')
Like the old saying goes
When the sun shines, let's make hay, ha

I'm a nervous fella (I'm a real gone lover)
I'm a nervous fella (ho, I'm a real gone lover)
I'm a n-n-n-nervous fella (and I'm a real gone lover)
I'm-m-m a n-n-n-nervous fella (and I'm a real gone lover)
I'm a nervous fella
So don't make me wait all night

(Sing one more time)

I'm a nervous fella
(He's a nervous fella)
I'm a nervous fella
(And I'm a real gone lover)

I'm a n-n-n nervous fella
(Ooo, he's a nervous fella)
I'm a n-n-n nervous fella
(And I'm a real gone lover)
I'm a nervous fella
So, don't make me wait all night
