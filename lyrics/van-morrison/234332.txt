It's been so long
Since I've seen your smile
Made me think about
When you were a child
It won't be long, I'm comin' home
Gonna get you in my arms
And make love to you, darlin', one more time


When I left, you didn't even say good-bye
And the tears kept rollin' from my eye
It won't be long, I'm comin' on home
Gonna get you in my arms
And make love to you, darlin', just one more time
Umm-mm

Yes, it won't be long, I'm comin' on home
Gonna get you in my arms
And make love to you, darlin', just one more time

Well they say, in this here world
There's a girl for ev'ry boy
You're the one, you're the one
That's brought me so much joy

It won't be long, I'm comin' on home
Gonna get you in my arms
And make love to you, darlin', just one more time
Yeah, one more time
One more time
Just, one more time
