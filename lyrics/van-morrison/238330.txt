Laughing in the wind
Cryin' in the rain
I've felt this way before
I'll feel this way again
And in a small cafe just passing time away
I'm giving you the eye
No need to wonder why


And it's hazy lazy waitin' for springtime
Roll along, roll along
And all you gotta do is
Listen to the song
To the melody
I would do it for you
Would you do it for me

And it's hazy lazy waitin' for springtime
Come along, roll along
And all you gotta do is
Listen to the song
To the melody
I would do it for you
Would you do it for me

I would do it for you
Would you do it for me
I would do it for you
Would you do it for me
