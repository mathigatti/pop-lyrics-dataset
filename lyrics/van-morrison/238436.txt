Think twice before you go
Baby, this'll be the end
Think twice before you go
Baby, this'll be the end
Can you leave me one time
Baby, you will leave again


Stay and suffer with me, baby
Then I'll know you paid your due
Stay and suffer with me, baby
Then I'll know you paid your due
If you're not there when I need you
Then you know you stand accused

Think twice before you go
Baby, this'll be the end
Think twice before you go
Baby, this'll be the end
If ya leave me one time
Baby, you will leave again

Ooh!

You're breakin' my heart
When ya know ya done me wrong
You're breakin' my heart
You know you done me wrong
Baby, come back home
Come back where you belong

Think twice before you go
Baby, this'll be the end
Think twice before you go
Baby, this'll be the end
If ya leave me one time
Baby, you will leave again

(One more time)

Think twice before you go
Baby, this'll be the end
Think twice before you go
Baby, this'll be the end
If ya leave me one time
Baby, you will leave again
