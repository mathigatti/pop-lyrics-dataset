Oh the warm feeling
As we sat beside the sea
Oh the warm feeling as I sat by you


Like a child within the kingdom
As we sat beside the sea
Oh the warm feeling as I sat by you

And it filled with devotion
And it made me plainly see
And it healed all my emotions
As I sat by you

As we sat inside the sunshine
And we sat beside the sea
Oh the warm feeling, as I sat by you

And it filled me with religion
And it gave great comfort to me
Oh the warm feeling as I sat by you

Oh the warm feeling as we sat beside the sea
Oh the warm feeling as I sat by you.
