When I was a young boy
Back in Orangefield
I used to gaze out
My classroom window and dream
And then go home and listen to Ray sing
"I believe to my soul" after school,
Oh that love that was within me
You know it carried me through
Well it lifted me up and it filled me
Meditation contemplation too


Chorus:
Oh we've got to go back
Got to go back
Got to go back
Got to go back
For the healing go on with the dreaming

Well there's people in the street
And the summer's almost here
We've got to go outside in the fresh air
And breathe while it's still clear
Breathe it in all the way down
To your stomach too
And breathe it out with a radiance
into the nightime air

We've got to go back etc. etc...

Got my ticket at the airport
Well I guess I've been marking time
I've been living in another country
That operates along entirely different lines
Keep me away from porter or whiskey
Don't play anything sentimental it'll make me cry
I've got to go back my friend
Is there really any need to ask why

We've got to go back etc. etc...
