All these wise guys tryin-a put us down
We gonna bring 'em on in
An' bring 'em on home


See them stumblin' by the way side
See them stumblin' by the way side
Though it won't sail, 'cross the water, yeah
Row-in boats a-cross the water
Pick them up baby, row them on
Bring 'em on in, bring 'em on home

Well, I was drivin', in my Jag-u-ar
Do-in' ninety miles an hour
I was drivin' up a clear way
It was just my luckiest day
An I, kept speed up
An I, rowed these boats
A-bring 'em on in
A-bring 'em on in

Bi-do-a, di-do-a, di-do-a-do

Now, I went walkin' down by Queensway
When I met a friend of mine
He said, "Come on back, back to my pad
We will have a nice time
If you pick me up, row me on
Bring me in, bring me in

When I stepped off the boat
And I walked upon the, dry land
Slowly, to the carpark
And I jumped in, outta my mind
Outta my mind
Bring 'em in, bring 'em on in, bring 'em in

Ay-ooo-lotta, ooo-li-otta, ooo-li-otta, ooo-li-otta
Ooo-li-otta, ooo-ah

Bring 'em in baby, bring 'em on in
Hey-hey now
Bring 'em on home
Bring 'em in, hey-hey-hey
Bring 'em on home, all right
Bring 'em on home

I said, pick me up, baby
Row me home, bring me in, hey

Bi-do-a, i-ooo-le, ooo-le-a, ooo-le-a
Ooo-la-te-do-da-la
Alright
Bi-oh-da-e-da-ee-da-ooo-a-la
Alright
