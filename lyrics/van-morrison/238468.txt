Who can I turn to
When no body needs me
My heart wants to go
So I must know
Where my destiny leads me
With no star to guide me
No one beside me
I will go on my way
And after today
The darkness will hide me


Maybe tomorrow
I going to find what I'm after
Throw out my sorrow
Beg steal or borrow
My share of laughter
With you I can cling to
I can learn too with you
I'm going to emulate
Who can I turn to
If you turn away

[Repeat last verse]

Who can I turn to?
