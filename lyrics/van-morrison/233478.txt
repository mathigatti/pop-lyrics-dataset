By the side of the tracks where the train goes by
The wind and the rain will catch you, you will sigh
Deep in your heart
Then you'll come a-running to me
You'll come a-running to me
Well you watch the train go 'round the bend
Play in dust and dream that it will never end
Deep in your heart
You'll come a-running to me
You'll come a-running to me
Said, hey, come a-running to me
Oh, come a-running to me
fHeK yeah, come a-running to me
Said, hey, come a-running to me
Oh, come a-running to me
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me
With your hound dog by your side
And your arms stretched out open wide
I wanna keep you satisfied in the morning sun
By my side, come on, come on run
And you kick the sand up with your heels
You think to yourself how good it feels
Put away all your walking shoes
Then you come running to me
Now you come running to me
I said, hey, come a-running to me
Oh, come a-running to me
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me
You gotta rainbow if you run to me
