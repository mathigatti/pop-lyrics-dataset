I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more 


I have seen without perceiving
I have been another man
Let me pierce the realm of glamour
So I know just what I am 

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more 

Feel the angel of the present
In the mighty crystal fire
Lift me up consume my darkness
Let me travel even higher 

I'm a dweller on the threshold
As I cross the burning ground
Let me go down to the water
Watch the great illusion drown 

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more 

I'm gonna turn and face the music
The music of the spheres
Lift me up consume my darkness 
When the midnight disappears 

I will walk out of the darkness
And I'll walk into the light
And I'll sing the song of ages
And the dawn will end the night 

I'm a dweller on the threshold 
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more 

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I cross some burning ground
And I'll go down to the water
Let the great illusion drown 

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more 

I'm a dweller on the threshold
Dweller on the threshold
I'm a dweller on the threshold
I'm a dweller on the threshold
