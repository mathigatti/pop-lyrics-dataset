The lion this time again
He's in the circus in a cage
He's trying to break out of the frame
The lion this time
He hears that same old sad refrain
But they can't hold him with no chain
And they just can't denounce his claim
The lion again


And he's trying to get free
He knows that something's bothering me
That I'm not too blind to see
The lion again
Oh, the love that's in his soul
Is trying to get out you know
If only you could hear it roar
The lion again this time

They couldn't take away his throne
He knows that he must stand alone
If need be, have a heart of stone
The lion again
The lion this time again
He's in the circus in a cage
No wonder that he's in a rage
The lion again
And he's trying to get free

And he knows that something's bothering me
Oh, but I'm not too blind to see
The lion this time
The longing that's in his soul
Is trying to get out you know
Only you could hear it roar
For the lion this time
They couldn't take away his throne

He knows that he must stand alone
If need be have a heart of stone
The lion again
The lion again this time
He's in the circus in a cage
No wonder that he's in a rage
The lion this time
The lion this time again

He's in the circus in a cage
No wonder that he's not the same
The lion again
The lion this time, the lion this time
The lion this time, the lion this time
The lion this time, the lion this time
The lion this time, the lion this time
The lion this time
