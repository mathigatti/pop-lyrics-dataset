The news is out, all over town
That you've been seen, out runnin' 'round
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go
You win again


This heart of mine, could never see
What ev'rybody knows, but me
Just trustin' you (ya gotta trust in me, baby)
Was my great sin
What can I do?
You win again

This heart of mine, oh, I could never see
What ev'rybody knows but me
Just trustin' you (just trustin' you)
Was my great sin (that was my great sin)
What can I do?
You win again
