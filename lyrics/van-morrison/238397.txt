Say that Richard Cory
Owns one-half of this here town
With political connections
To spread his wealth around
Born into society, a banker's only child
He had everything a man could want
Power, grace and style


But I, I work in his factory
And I curse the life that I'm livin'
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be
Yeah, hey I wish that I could be
Lord, I wish that I could be, Richard Cory

The paper's print his picture
Everywhere he go
Richard Cory at the opera
Richard Cory at the show
And the rumours of his parties
And orgies on his yacht
Heart and soul he must be happy
With everything that he has got

But I, I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm livin'
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be
Yeah, wish that I could be
Lord, I wish that I could be, Richard Cory

He freely give to charity And had the common touch
They were grateful for his patronage
And thanked him very much
So my mind was filled with wonder
When the evenin' headlines read
That Richard Cory went home last night
And put a bullet through his head, hu

But I, I, work in his factory
And I don't dig the life I'm livin'
I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be
And I wish that I could be
Well, I wish that I could be, Richard Cory

Yeah, I wish that I could be
Lord, I wish that I could be
Yeah, I wish that I could be
Yes, oh I wish that I could be
Just like Richard Cory
