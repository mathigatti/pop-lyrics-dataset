Found myself, found myself
Oh, in a restaurant in Venice
Found myself
Oh, in a restaurant in Venice
I was talkin' to my baby
In a restaurant down in Venice
When I found myself
Down in Venice
And I'm cryin'
But my tears, but my tears
Are filled with joy
And I'm walkin' in Venice
And I'm cryin'


Chorus:
Dum derra dum dum diddy diddy dah dah
Dum derra dum dum diddy diddy dah dah
Dum derra dum dum diddy diddy dah dah
Dum derra dum dum diddy diddy dah dah
Dum derra dum dum diddy diddy dah dah
Dum derra dum dum diddy diddy dah dah

As I'm leaving Venice, as I'm leaving Venice
As I'm leaving Venice
All the streets are wet with rain
And in my memory, and in my memory
And in my memory
I remember it well

And I take a stroll
Oh, see the ships come sailing in
In the harbor in the harbor
Down in Venice

And I'm cryin'
But my tears, but my tears
Are filled with joy
And I'm walkin' in Venice
And I'm cryin'

[Chorus]

Walkin' in Venice and I'm cryin'
Oh, as I'm walkin' in Venice, walkin' in Venice
And I'm cryin'
Well, I'm walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk walk, walk
Walkin' in Venice
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, I walk and I walk and I walk and I walk
Well, I'm walkin' in Venice
I walk and I walk and I walk
And I feel you and I see you as I'm walkin'
Down in Venice
Now sing a song, goes like this:

[Chorus]
