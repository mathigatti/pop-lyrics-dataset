You're a slave to the capitalist system
Which is ruled by the global elite
What happened to, the individual
What happened to, the working class white
They filled his head with so much propaganda
Entertainment on tv and all kinds of shite
What happened to the individual
When he gave up all of his rights


Tell you up is down and wrong is right
Nothing to hang your hat on, can't even get uptight
You're controlled by the media
Everything you say and do
What happened to, the individual
Tell me what happened to you
Tell you up is down, not able to fight

Keep you docile and complacent
Can't even get uptight
Controlled by the media and you
Don't know what you can do
They took away your constitution
You don't even know what happened to you

Waffle is the language that they
Taught you, taught you to talk
But you can't even get any angle
'Cause you forgot how. Keep on walking the walk
You're a slave to the capitalist system
And it's controlled by the global elite
Double dealing with the banks
Behind your back, just can't fight
