Hey girl!
When ya' swish and sway
In your yellow dress
'Cross the crowded room
Boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom


Hey girl!
Freckles on your arms
Freckles on your face
Can't we find a place
In a crowded room, we go

Boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom
(Chicka-boom, chicka-boom)
Boom (chicka-boom, chicka-boom-boom)
Boom chicka-boom, chicka-boom
(Chicka-chicka-chicka-boom)

A-hey, girl!
I'm goin' away
But I'm comin' back
With a ginger cat
What'd ya think a-that?

Hey girl!
I'm goin' away
But I'm comin' back
By the railroad track

Where the trains go by
And we sang and cry in gloom
Boom, chicka-boom
(Chicka-boom, chicka-boom)

Hey, girl!
(Chicka-boom, chick-a boom-boom)
When ya' swish and sway
(Chicka, chicka, chicka-boom)
In your yellow dress
'Cross the crowded room, boom√ä

Boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom
(Chicka-boom, chicka-boom)
Boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom
