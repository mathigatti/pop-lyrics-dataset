I went out last night walkin'
I heard someone talkin'
You better stop stayin out late at night
A straighten up and fly right


You better stop tellin' those lies
A gonna cut you down to my size
You got one, you got two
Brown eyes
Hypnotize, hypnotize, hypnotize

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Whoa oh oh ooh ooh
Oh oh oh
Whoa whoa oh oh oh
Whoa whoa oh oh oh

(Instrumental)

You got such pretty good looks
But don't read about good books
You better stop stayin' out late at night
A straighten up and fly right

I'm gonna cut you down to my size
You got one two brown eyes
They hypnotize, oh what eyes
Hypnotize

Yeah-ay-yeah
Yeah-ay-yeah
Whoa oh oh oh whoa whoa
Whoa whoa oh oh oh
Whoa whoa
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh

(Instrumental to end)
