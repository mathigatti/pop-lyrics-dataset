You gotta help me
Can't do it all by myself
Yout gotta
Can't do it all by myself
You don't help me darlin'
Find someone else


When I walk, I walk with you
When I talk, I talk to you
Oh baby, can't do it all by myself
Don't help me darlin'
Find someone else

Bring me my nightshirt
Put on your morning gown
Bring me my nightshirt
Put on your morning gown
I don't feel tired
But I, sho' feel like lyin' down
Oh Lord, help me

[Instrumental &amp; guitar solo]

When I walk, I walk with you
When I talk, I talk to you
Hear me talkin' to ya
Hear me talkin' to ya

Don't help me, find someone else

Bring me my nightshirt
Put on your morning gown
Bring me my nightshirt
Put on your morning gown
I don't feel tired

Bring-a-me, bring-a-me, bring-a-me, bring-a-me
Bring-a-me, bring-a-me, bring-a-me, bring-a-me
Bring-a-me, bring-a-me, bring-a-me
Nightshirt

Put on your morning gown
I'm not tired, I just feel like lyin' down

Bring me my nightshirt
Put on your morning gown
Well, bring me my nightshirt, ha
Put on your morning gown
I will always feel better
Feel like lyin' down

Oh yeah.
