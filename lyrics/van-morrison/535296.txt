What am I living for, if not for you?
Tell me what am I living for, if not for you?
What am I living for, if not for you?
Oh nobody else, nobody else will do


What am I longing for each lonely night?
To feel your lips to mine and hold you tight
You'll be my only love my whole life through
Baby nobody else, nobody else will do

I want you close to me, oh that's all I know
I want you all the time, darlin' I love you so

What am I living for, if not for you?
Oh what am I living for, child if not for you?
I wanna know what am I livin' for if not for you?
Oh now, nobody else, nobody else will do

I want you close to me, oh that's all I know
I want you all the time, darlin' I love you so
Oh what am I living for, if not for you?
Oh, what am I living for, if not for you?
What am I living for, if not for you?
Oh nobody else, nobody else will do
Oh no, nobody else, nobody else will do, child
