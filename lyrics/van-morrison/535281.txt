Well I'm standing on the corner
With my bucket in my hand
Just waiting for a woman
That ain't got no man


My bucket's got a hole in it
My bucket's got a hole in it
My bucket's got a hole in it
Can't buy no beer

Well I went up on the mountain
Looked down in the sea
Seen the crabs and the fishes
Doing the be bop beat

My bucket's got a hole in it
My bucket's got a hole in it
My bucket's got a hole in it
Can't buy no beer

Well there ain't no use
Me working so hard
When I got a woman
In the boss mans yard

My bucket's got a hole in it
My bucket's got a hole in it
My bucket's got a hole in it
Can't buy no beer
