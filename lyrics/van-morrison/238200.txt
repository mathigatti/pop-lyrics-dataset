Beautiful vision
Stay with me all of the time
Beautiful vision
Stay ever on my mind with your beautiful...


Mystical rapture
I am in ecstasy
Beautiful vision
Don't ever separate me from your beautiful...

In the darkest night
You are shining bright
You are my guiding light
You show me wrong from right

Beautiful vision
Stay ever on my mind
Beautiful vision
Stay with me all of the time with your beautiful vision

In the darkest night
I said you are shining bright
You are my guiding light
Show me wrong from right

Beautiful vision
Stay with me all of the time
Beautiful vision
Stay ever on my mind with your beautiful vision
I can make it
I can make it
With your beautiful vision
