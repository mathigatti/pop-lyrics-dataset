Some days it gets completely crazy
And I feel like howling at the moon
Then sometimes it feels so easy
Like I was born with a silver spoon
Other times you just can't reach me
Seems like I've got a heart of stone
Guess I need my solitude


And I have to make it on my own
Well I guess I'm going a.w.o.l.
Disconnect my telephone
Just like greta garbo
I want to be alone
Need to make some real connection
Baby something's just got to give
'Cos I've been too long in exile

I've been grinding at the mill
Too long to decode all the secrets
Have to get some elbow room
Most people think that everything
Is just what they assume
Well I know I'm going a.w.o.l.
Tell everyone I'm not at home
Just like Greta Garbo

I just want to be alone
Well I'm going out to l.a.
I wanna get my business done
Then I'm going on to vegas
Then I'm going on the run
If anybody asks you have you seen me
Please just tell them no
'Cos I'm living on the outside

And I have nowhere to go
Well I guess I'm going a.w.o.l.
Disconnect my telephone
Just like Greta Garbo
I just want to be alone
I just want to be alone
Disconnect my telephone
Just like Greta Garbo
I just want to be alone
