[Chorus:]
When you come down
From your Ivory Tower
You will see how it really must be
To be like me to see like me
To feel like me


Take a look at me I'm a poor man's son
I never did no harm to no one
You've got money in the bank
And I don't have none

When you come down etc etc....

[Bridge:]
You can see through
Your rose coloured glasses
In a world that seems
like glamour to you
You've got opinions and judgements about
All kind of things
That you don't know anything about

Don't you know the price that I have to pay
Just to do everything I have to do
Do you think that there's nothing to it
You should try it sometime

[Chorus]
