Oh it takes a worried man, sing a worried song
Takes a worried man, come sing a little worried song
Well it takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now, won't be worried long


I went down to the riverside and I laid me down to sleep
Went down to the riverside, laid me down to sleep, Lord
A-well I went down to the riverside, laid me down to sleep
When I woke up there were shackles on both-a my feet
Hit it!

[Chorus]
It takes a worried man, to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man (come) to sing a worried song
Yeah, it takes a worried man, yeah, to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
Worry for me!

[Instrumental]

I said, "Judge (judge) judge, what's a-gonna be my fine?"
I said, "Judge (judge) judge (judge) tell me what's gonna be my fine?
I said, "Judge (judge) judge (judge) tell me what's gonna be my fine?
He said, "Twenty-one years (oh) on that old Rock Island Line

Oh well it takes a worried man, to sing a worried song
Takes a worried man, to sing a worried song
Yeah, it takes a worried man, to sing a worried song
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long
Sing it one more time!

It takes a worried man, to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man, to sing a worried song, my Lord
It takes a worried man, to sing a worried song
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long
