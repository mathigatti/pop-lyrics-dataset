Well my room has got two windows 
The sunlight never comes through 
I'm so sad and lonely, baby 
Since I broke off baby with you 


I live on a lonely avenue 
Little girl, since you said you're through 
Now I feel so sad and blue 
It's all because of you 
I could die, I could die, I could die 
I could die, I could die, I could die 
I live on a lonely avenue 

My pillow is made of lead 
And my cover is made of stone 
I toss and turn every night 
I'm not used to livin' alone 

I live on a lonely avenue 
Girl, since you said we're through 
And I feel so sad and blue 
You know it's all because of you 
I could die, I could die, I could die 
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry 
I live on a Lonely Avenue 
A lonely avenue
