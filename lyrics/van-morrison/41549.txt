Well it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'neath the color of October skies.
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low.


You know the nights magic, seems to whisper and hush,
You know the soft moonlight, seem to shine-In your blush
Can I just have one more moondance with you-my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you-my love?

Well I wanna make love to you tonight,
I can't wait till the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right,
and straight into my arms you will run.
And when you come my heart will be waiting,
to make sure that you're never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true dear,
There and then I will make you my own.

And everytime i touch you-you just tremble inside
then i know how much you want to want me that-
you cant hide
Can I just have one more moondance with you-my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you-my love?
(SOLOS)

Well it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night for making romance
'neath the color of October skies.
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low.

You know the nights magic, seems to whisper and hush
You know the soft moonlight, seems to shine-In your blush
Can I just have one more moondance with you-my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you-my love?
One more moondance with you... in the moonlight
on a magic night......
in the moonlight
on a magic night
can i just have one more moondance with you- my love
