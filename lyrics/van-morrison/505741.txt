You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Youder stands your orphain with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue


The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky, too, is folding over you
And it's all over now, baby blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your armies, are all going home
Your lover who nave just walked through the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

Leave your steping-stones behind, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start a new
And it's all over now, baby blue
