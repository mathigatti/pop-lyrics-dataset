I'm stranded at the edge of the world
It's a world I don't know
Got no where to go
Feels like I'm stranded
And I'm stranded between
That ol' devil and the deep blue sea


And nobody's gonna tell me
Tell me what, what time it is
Everyday, everyday, it's hustle
Hustle time, hustle time
Everyday and every way
One more, one more mountain to climb

It's leaving me stranded
In my own little island
With my eyes open wide
But I'm feeling stranded
Every, every, everyday, it's hustle time

Every way, one more mountain to climb
I'm stranded between the devil
And the deep blue sea
There ain't no where else to be
'Cept right here and I'm stranded
