Tear your playhouse
Tear your playhouse, tear your playhouse down
Tear your playhouse, tear your playhouse down
Oh all that money it's going underground
Baby all that money
All that money don't it make you frown
All that money don't it make you frown
Careless love done tore your playhouse down


All that money, all that money
All that pounds, shillings and pence
All that money, all that pounds, shillings and pence
All that money but it's just no common sense

Going down to Florida, going down to Florida
Gonna move you off my mind
Going down to Florida, I'm gonna get you off my mind
Going down to Florida just to bide my time
All that money
All that money don't it make you frown
All that money don't it make you frown
Careless love done burned your playhouse down, playhouse down

Careless love done burned your playhouse down
Burned your playhouse, burned your playhouse down
