A good morning little schoolgirl,
Can I go home with you?
Tell your mama and your daddy,
That I'm a little schoolboy too


Baby I love you,
I just can't help help myself
You're so good looking pretty babe,
I don't need nobody else.

Good morning little schoolgirl,
Can I go home with you?
Uh, Uh, Uh
I'm gonna leave you baby,
About the break of day
On account of the way you treat me,
I've got to stay away

A good morning little schoolgirl,
Can I go home with you?
Tell your mama and your daddy,
That I'm a little schoolboy too

Come on pretty baby,
Oh you know I can't help myself
Uh, Uh, Uh
I'm gonna buy me an aeroplane,
To fly all over your town.
And tell everybody baby,
Lord knows you've been putting me down.

I can't stand it babe,
Just cannot help myself
You're so young and pretty,
But you're lovin' somebody else

A good morning little schoolgirl,
Can I go home with you?
Uh, uh, uh
Oh babe what you do to me,
I can't help myself
