From the ancient sun to the old heart stove come the troubadours
From the city gates to the castle walls it's the troubadours
On a sunlit day it was bright and clear
And the people came from far and they came from near
To hear the troubadours


Well the troubadours sang their songs of love to the lady fair
She was sitting outside on a balcony in in the cool night air
It was a starry night the moon was shining bright
And the trumpets rang and they gave a chime
For the troubadours

And for everyman all across the land and from shore to shore
They came singin' songs of love and chivalry from the days of yore

Baby lift your window high do you hear that sound
It's the troubadours as they go through town

Baby lift your window high do you hear that sound
It's the troubadours with their freedom song

Lift your window high turn your lamp down low baby
Don't you know I love you so

Lift your window high do you dig that sound
It's the troubadours coming through town
