Let's talk it over, let's get get it straight
Don't let th' situation escalate
You know there's always problems when a man is wrapped up in his art
But don't you worry baby you can count on me to do my part


You keep on working, I'm looking round
Don't let your girlfriend put me down
You know it's tough these days for a proud man to make a start
But don't you worry baby you can count on me to do my part

You wash the dishes, I've gotta run
You know that night life ain't such fun
Now don't wait up for me 'cause I know you need your rest, sweetheart
But don't you worry baby you can count on me to do my part
