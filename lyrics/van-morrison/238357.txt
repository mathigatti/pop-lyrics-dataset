Been workin' in nightclubs so long, can hardly stand the break of day
Been workin' in nightclubs so long, can hardly stand the break of day
Run down rooms and bad places
But it's still the only way


Gonna be here through Sunday evening, be someplace else on Tuesday night
Gonna be here through Sunday evening, be someplace else on Tuesday night
If I get home with all my money
Everything will be alright

If I had a million dollars, I'd sit right down and relax
If I had a million dollars, I'd sit right down and relax
I'd go off and buy myself a nightclub
And write it off my income tax
