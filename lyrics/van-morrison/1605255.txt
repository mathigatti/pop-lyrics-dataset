Don't lose the wonder in your eyes
I can see it right now when you smile
Let me go back, for a while
Let me go back, for a while
To that magic time


You can call it nostalgia, I don't mind
Standing on that windswept hillside
Listenin' to the church bells chime
Listen to the church bells chime
In that magic time

Oh the road it never ends
Good to see you my old friend
Once again we sit right down and share the wine

Shivers up and down my spine
It's a feeling so divine
Let me go back for a while
Got to back for a while
To that magic time

Oh the road it never ends
Good to see you my old friend
Once again we'll sit down and share the wine

And we'll go back in your prime
The sun is gonna shine
When we go back for a while
When we go back for a while
To that magic time

Don't lose the wonder in your eyes
It's right there when you smile
Got to go back, for a while
Got to go back, for a while
To that magic time

Call it nostalgia, I don't mind
Standing on that windswept hillside
Listenin' to the church bells chime
Listenin' to the church bells chime
In that magic time

If we go back, for a while
Let me go back, for a while
To that magic time
