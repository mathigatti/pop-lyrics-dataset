Hey where did we go
Days when the rains came
Down in a hollow
Playin' a new game


Laughin' and a runnin' hey hey
Skippin' and a jumpin'
In the misty mornin' fog
With our, our hearts a thumpin'
And you my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

And what ever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Gone down the old mine with a
Transistor radio

Standin' in the sunlight laughin'
Hidin' behind a rainbow's wall
Slippin' and a slidin'
All along the waterfall
With you my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when
We used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da (just like that)
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da
La ti da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, you have grown

Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
Makin' love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when
We used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da
(Bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit)
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da
(SHA LA LA LA LA)
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da
