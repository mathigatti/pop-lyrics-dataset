Your cheatin' heart
Will make you weep
You'll cry &amp; cry
You'll try to sleep
But sleep won't come
The whole night through
Your cheatin' heart
Will tell on you


When tears come down
Like pourin' rain
You'll toss around
And call my name
You'll walk the floor
The way I do
Your cheatin' heart
Will tell on you

When tears come down
Like fallin' rain
You'll toss around
And call my name
You'll walk the floor
Just the way I do
Your cheatin' heart
Will tell on you

Your cheatin' heart
Will tell on you
