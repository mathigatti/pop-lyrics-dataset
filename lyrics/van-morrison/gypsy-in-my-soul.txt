It's just the gypsy in my soul
Make me pack up my things and go
It may seem like I'm on a roll
But it's just the gypsy in my soul
Layin' out in the midday sun
Tryin' so hard not to run
Looking out at the deep blue sea


I guess it's just the gypsy in me
Jump on that train, catch that plane
Here and there and back again
Well it seems like some kind of cruel fate
Keep me moving in this restless state
Sometimes it feels like I don't have any goal
It's just the gypsy

Catch that train, jump on that plane
Here and there and back again
Well it seems like some kind of cruel fate
Keep me moving, moving in permanent restless state
Seems like some days I don't have any goal
It's just the gypsy in my soul
Gypsy in my soul
Gypsy in my soul
