In the lonely, dead of midnight
In the dimness, of the twilight
By the streetlight, by the lamplight
I'll be around


In the sunlight, in the daylight
And I'm workin', on the insight
And I'm tryin' to keep, my game uptight
I'll be around

And your memory, I heard this lonely lonely music once
And your memory, has been haunting me ever since

When I'm tryin', tryin' to come down
In my world, my room keeps spinning round
And I'm tryin' to get my feet, back on the ground
You come around

In my memory, I heard the lonely, lonely music once
In my memory, its been haunting me ever since

In the lonely, dead of midnight
In the dimness of the twilight
If you meet me, by the lamplight
I'll be around

And I'm tryin' for the come down
And my room, keeps spinning round and round
And I'm tryin' to get my feet right back on the ground
You come around
