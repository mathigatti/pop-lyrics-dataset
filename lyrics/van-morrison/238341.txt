All the men would turn their head
When she walked down the street
Clothes are fine and hair that shine
Smiling oh so sweet, smiling oh so sweet


Got a taste of all religion
Comes on with the new
In her hair a yellow ribbon
And she's decked out all in blue
Oh yes in, decked out all in blue

Steppin' lightly, steppin' brightly
With her books in hand
Going to the university to teach them
Help them understand
And are helping 'em understand

And all the kids would love to see her
Follow in her steps
And tell her stories and adore her
Climb in through the fence
Climb in through the fence

Here she comes walking
Here she comes talking
I do believe it's Madame Joy
Walking past that old street corner
And she's looking for her boy
Oh yes she is, looking for her boy

Steppin' lightly, steppin' brightly
With her books in hand
Going to the university to teach them
Help them understand
Yeah, help them understand

I was looking at the way she moved me
And I was seeing every side
Tell me, can I learn the language
Have you got the mind, have you got the mind

Here she comes walking
Here she comes talking
I do believe it's Madame Joy
She's walking by that old street corner
And she's looking for her boy
Oh yes looking for her boy

And all the men would turn their head
When she walked down the street
Clothes refined and hair that shine
And smiling oh so sweet, oh yes, she's smiling oh so sweet
Smiling, smiling oh so sweet, yeah, yeah, yeah
Smiling, smiling oh so sweet

And all the men would
And all the men would turn their head around
When that woman walked down the street
When that woman walked down the street
When that, when that woman walked
When that woman walked, when that woman walked
When that woman walked, when that woman walked
When that woman walked, what she wore
When that woman, when that woman, when that woman
When that woman, when that woman, when that woman
When that woman, when that woman, when that woman
When that woman, when that woman walked
She just walked
Just kept on walking down the street
When she walked, when she walked down
When she walked on down
