Your street, rich street or poor
Used to always be sure, on your street
There's a place in your heart you know from the start
Can't be complete outside of the street
Keep moving on through the joy and the pain
Sometimes you got to look back
To the street again
Would you prefer all those castles in Spain
Or the view of your street from your window pane


And you walked around in the heart of town
Listening for that sound
And the street only knew your name
Well the street only knew your name, your name

Well Walter and John, Katie and Ron
Used to hang out by the corner lamp light
Get together and sing some songs
Like rhythm and blues you make me feel alright
That were long before fortune and fame
Nothing to lose and so much to gain
Everyone knew who everyone was
And they knew it because of the street

And you walk around in the heart of town
Listening for that sound
While the street only knew your name
Well the street only knew your name, your name

And you walk around in the heart of town
Listening for that sound
While the street only knew your name
The street only knew your name, your name
Sing it, Be-Bop-A-Lula
Who Slapped John?
Well the street only knew your name
