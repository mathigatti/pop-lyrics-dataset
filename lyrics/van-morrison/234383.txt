The rain is all over, it's only stopped for an hour
And I stop you, and I stop you
When you go too far
And you stop me when I go too far
And it tried to freak me
But I should have known
It's not the twilight zone no, it's not the twilight zone
Yes it's just a party phone, pure honeycomb, honeycomb, honeycomb


You tried to take me in a slow poke draw
Like the cowboy wished
And you got just what you saw
Well, you got what you saw
Didn't you get, didn't you get, didn't you get
So, don't let it freak you
When, when it gets down to the bone
You know it's not the twilight zone, it's not the twilight zone
It's just a party phone, and honeycomb, honeycomb
It's not, it's not the twilight zone
It's just a party phone
Honeycomb, honeycomb, honeycomb, honeycomb

[Spoken:]
It's not, it's not the twilight zone
It's just a party phone

And honeycomb, ya!
You know it's not the twilight zone
It's, it's just a party phone
Honeycomb, honeycomb, honeycomb, honeycomb

You know what it is
Just a party phone, party, phone
Honeycomb, honeycomb, honeycomb, honeycomb
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Honeycomb, honeycomb
Honeycomb
