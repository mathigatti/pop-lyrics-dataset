In the land of a thousand dances
I dance with you
I was out I was taking my chances
When dreams came true
When you came into my dream
Like from a whisper to a scream


And it's a real heavy connection
It's just a real heavy connection
It's a real heavy connection
Lalalala...

I remember when I got your message in Amsterdam
I was going through my letters
And found a picture-postcard of the Reeperbahn
When you came into the room
Not too late and not too soon

And it's a real heavy connection
And it's a real heavy connection
And it's a real heavy connection
Lalalala...

And you came into my dreams
From a whisper to a scream

And it's a real heavy connection
And it's a real heavy connection
It's just a real heavy connection
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala

And it's a real heavy connection
And it's a real heavy connection
And it's a real heavy connection
Lalalala...
Baby, baby, baby
I can't stop this rainbow
Touching my soul
I can't stop this rainbow
In my soul
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
