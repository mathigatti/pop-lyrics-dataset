You sit in silence
And the river answers
And I have loved you many, many years
I saw you standing by the wonderous river
And I have come today
To calm your fears


Those lifetimes
So many lifetimes
With you

The boatman singin' far across the water
What is this feelin' in my heart and soul
The nighttime angel spreads her wings around me
And I feel the sadness
And the river flows

Those lifetimes
So many lifetimes
With you

Listen to the music inside
That is all that you have to do
Listen to the music inside
Can't you hear what it says to you

And I shall get to know you
In these lifetimes
In awe and wonder
On down through the years
The nighttime angel spreads her wings around me
I feel the silence
And my doubts are cleared

Those lifetimes
So many lifetimes
With you

Listen to the music inside
That is all that you have to do
Listen to the music inside
Can't you hear what it says to you

Listen to the music inside
That is all that you have to do
Listen to the music inside
Can't you hear what it says to you
