Well, it takes more than a robin
To make a winter cold
Then it takes two lips of fire
To melt away the snow
Yeah, and it takes two hearts a-cookin'
To make a fire glow
And baby, you got what it takes


(Pullin' together)

Well, it takes a lot of kissin'
To make a romance sweet
And it takes a lot of lovin'
To make my life complete

And it takes a lot of woman
To knock me off-a my feet

And baby, you got what it takes

Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-we
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-we
Baby, you've got just what it takes

And it takes more than an effort
To stay away from you
And it takes more than a lifetime
To prove that I'll be true
(Sing it with me)

Yeah, and it takes somebody special
To make me say, "I do"
And baby, you got what it takes

Woo-woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-we
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-we
Baby, you got just what it takes

Well, it takes more than an effort (hoo)
To stay away from you (ooo, I know it)
And it takes more than a lifetime
To prove that I'll be true

And it takes somebody special
To make me say, "I do"
And baby, you got what it takes
Oh yeah

And baby, you got what it takes

And baby, you got what it takes
