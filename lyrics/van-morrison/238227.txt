Puerto Rican Nursery Rhymes
Angels in the snow and thyme
And I'm keeping my mind on that rose
In a church in Spanish Harlem


Got Watchtowers and Awakes for free
In the laundromat for you and me
But you can't take me down that way
As I'm not sinking

And if we go down one time
Next times not gonna be the last time
And I'm contemplating that rose
In a church in Spanish Harlem
Didn't I bring you precious gifts
Came to kiss you on the lips
Didn't even appear
To beg your pardon

To lay out in the morning sun
Feel the cool breeze and the one
Right there in, in my garden
Puerto Rican Nursery Rhymes
And angels, and angels, and the snow and thyme
But I'm keeping my mind on that rose
In a church in Spanish Harlem

Yeah, and if we go, if we go down one time
The next time will not be the last time, and I'm
Keeping my mind on that, contemplating that rose
Up in a church in Spanish Harlem

And if we go down one time, you know
The next time it won't be the last time
And I'm contemplating that rose
In a church in Spanish Harlem

And I'm contemplating that rose
In a church in Spanish Harlem
And I'm contemplating, and I'm contemplating that rose
In a church in Spanish Harlem
And I'm contemplating that rose
In a church in Spanish Harlem
And I'm contemplating that rose
In a church, in a church in Spanish Harlem
