See you smile
Angel child,
That's all i ever wanted to do.
See your laugh
In a photograph,
That's all i ever wanted to do.
See your swishin' walk,
And talk your baby talk,
That's all i ever wanted to do.
Lorna,
Lorna,
That's all i ever wanted to do.
Carry you,
Carry you down by the banks of the river,
All along down,
All along down the grasses' [throne ?].
Carry you, carry you,
By the banks of the river,
That's all,
That's all i wanted to do.
I'll carry all your books to school,
And maybe be your fool,
That's all i wanted to do.
Ah, just to hold your hand
All along the golden sand,
That's all i wanted to do.
Lorna,
Lorna,
That's all i ever wanted to do.
