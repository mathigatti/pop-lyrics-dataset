Sinking fast, hold tight
Just remember ordinary life
More trouble, than it's worth
Know it when you see the sign
Nothing feels right, step out of line
Just remember ordinary mind


Nagging wife, starts a fight
Trying to make you uptight
Workaholic, on your bike
Take a look at it in the daylight
Nothing feels right, step out of line
Think ordinary mind

Ordinary life, be my rock in times of trouble
Get me back on the earth
Put my feet on the ground

Keep on pushing, make it useful
Do what you've gotta do
Keep on moving, keep on doing
Combat ordinary strife
Need a woman, be my friend
Understand ordinary life

Ordinary life, be my rock in times of trouble
Bring me down to earth
Keep my feet on the ground

Keep on pushing, make it useful
Do what you have to do
Keep on working, keep on doing
Combat ordinary strife
Need a woman, be my friend
Understand ordinary life.
