Don't worry about tomorrow
That ain't gonna help you none
Don't worry about tomorrow
That ain't gonna help you none
You've gotta live and take each day as it comes


It may not be exactly what you're looking for
It may not be exactly what you're looking for
But what you're looking for
Ain't gonna come walking
Through your front hall door, oh no
So, don't worry about tomorrow

Gotta live each day as it comes
Don't worry about tomorrow
You gotta live each day as it comes
It's the only way you seem to get things done
