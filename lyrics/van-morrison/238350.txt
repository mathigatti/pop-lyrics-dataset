My little baby (oh, yeah)
I love you so (uh-huh)
Why did you leave me? (oh, no)
Why did you ever go?


So many faces (oh, yeah)
Along the way (uh-huh)
But none replaces (oh, no)
The one that's gone away, gone away
Gone away from me

I keep countin' the memories of your kisses
Darlin', your picture's in my pocket
And you chain is on my wrist
Forever, an' ever, an' ever, an' ever

My little baby (oh, yeah)
Oh baby, you baby (uh-huh)
Around the next corner (oh, yeah)
And you're runnin' to me
Runnin' to me

My little baby (oh, yeah)
Don't you know I need you so? (uh-huh)

I'll never (oh, yeah)
I'll never, ever let you go
