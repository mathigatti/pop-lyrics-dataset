Send me your picture
Send me your pillow
Send it through Krishna
On the Vanlose Stairway


Send me your bible
Send me your Gita
I want to reach you
On the Vanlose Stairway

And your stairway
Reaches up to the moon
And it comes right back
It comes right back to you

Send me some loving
Send me some kissing
You know what I'm missing
On the Vanlose Stairway

On the Vanlose Stairway
Right there, hold it

And your stairway
Reaches up to the moon
And it comes right back
And it comes right back to you

Send me your bible child
Send me your Gita...
