I'm gonna move you baby
Way on the outskirts of town
Oh I'm gonna move you darlin'
I said way on the outskirts of town
Because I don't want nobody
Who's always hangin' 'round


Mmm, maybe funny baby
Funny as can be
We have any children
I want 'em all to look like me

Well I'll move you darlin'
Way on the outskirts of town
'Cause I don't want nobody
Nobody always hangin' 'round
(Play it now)

A move me a new baby
Way from here
I don't know how I can get no iceman out
I'm wanna get me a Fridgidaire

We gonna move
Way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want no bully
Always hangin' around

I'm gonna move darlin'
'Way on the outskirts of town
I'm gonna move darlin'
Way, way on the outskirts of town (yeah)
Because I don't want nobody
Always hangin' 'round

(Play it for me, play guitar)

[Instrumental]

It may seem funny, honey
Funny as can be
Have any children
Want 'em all to look like me

I'm gonna move you darlin'
All the way on the outskirts of town
Because I don't want nobody
Who's always hangin' around
Oh, no no no no, yeah!
