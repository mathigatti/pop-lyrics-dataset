Got a woman, broke my heart
Took it darlin' , tore it apart
You left me sitting by the fire cryin'
You said your love for me was dyin'


And I'm beggin' you baby
Baby please
I'm beggin' you baby
I'm down on my knees

Turn on your light
Let is shine on me
Turn on your love light
Let it shine on me
Let it shine, shine, shine
Let it shine

Now I wanna know
I gotta know baby
Feel alright
Feel alright
And I ah-woo, feel alright

(Instrumental)

Feel alittle lonely in the middle of the night
I need you darlin' everything alright
Turn on your light
Let it shine on me
Turn on your love light
Let it shine on me

Alittle bit higher (turn on your lovelight)
Alittle bit higher (turn on your lovelight)
Alittle bit higher (turn on your lovelight)
Alittle bit higher baby (turn on your lovelight)

Alittle bit higher (turn on your lovelight)
Alittle bit higher (turn on your lovelight) 
I wanna know yeah (turn on your lovelight)
I gotta know (turn on your lovelight)

She's all that I need (turn on your lovelight)
She's all that I need (turn on your lovelight)
All that I need (turn on your lovelight)
Ooo, alright (turn on your lovelight)
