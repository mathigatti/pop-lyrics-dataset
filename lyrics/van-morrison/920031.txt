I can hear the sound of violins
I can hear the piper play
And every time the song begins
You just steal my heart away


The journey's longer than
I thounght my love
There's lost of things
Get in the way
But every time I think of you
You just steal my heart away

Just like a morning
In May like this 
See the heater on the hill
There's a place way up
The mountainside
Where the world
Keeps standing still

Just like the sunshine after rain
I'll come
To be with you will save the day
'cos I know
When I'm with yo again
You just steal my heart away

Just like a morning
In May like this 
We see the heater on the hill
There's a place up on
The mountainside
Where the world is
Standing still

Just like the sunshine after rain I'll come
To be with you will save the day'cos I know
When I'm with yo again
You just steal my heart away

'cos I know
When I'm with yo again
You just steal my heart away

'cos I know
When I'm with yo again
You just steal my heart away

cos I know
When I'm with yo again
You just steal my heart away
