It's a lot like bein' little
And wantin' a brand new toy.
It's a lot like bein' little
And wantin' a baby boy
To call brother,
And it hurts
When you want it
So bad.
It's a lot like bein' a young boy
Who cannot make the team.
It's a lot like bein' a young girl
Who cannot help but dream
Of her best friend's brother,
And it hurts
When you want it
So bad.


When it's love
You've had and lost,
If that's the worst hurt
You've ever had,
Waiting for a new love
To come along,
And maybe, baby,
[It's] just as bad.

It's a lot like bein' a man
When you['ve] no one to call your own,
And it's a lot like bein' a woman
When you want to make a home
And be a mother,
And it hurts when you want it
So bad.
Hey, yeah.

When it's love
You've had and lost,
That's the worst hurt
You've ever had,
Waiting, waiting for a new love
To come along,
It may be, baby,
May be just as bad, Lord.

It's a lot like bein' a man
When you['ve] no one to call your own,
And it's a lot like bein' a woman
When ya' want
To make a home
And be a mother,
And it hurts
When ya' want it so bad.
When ya' want it,
Want it so bad.
When ya', when ya', when ya', when ya', when ya', When ya',
When ya' want it.
When ya, when ya', when ya', when ya', when ya', When ya', when ya', when ya', when ya', when ya', When ya', when ya',
When ya, when ya', when ya', when ya', when ya', When ya', when ya',
When ya', when ya', when ya', when ya', when ya', When ya', when ya', when ya',
[When ya' want it so bad.]
