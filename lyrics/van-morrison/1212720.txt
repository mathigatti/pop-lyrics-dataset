When too many demands have destroyed all my plans
Going down to end of the land
If I have to drive all night just to feel all right
Going down to the end of the land


When it gets out of hand and I fail to agree
Just what's in it for me?
Going down to the sea

Then I've got to run towards the setting sun
Going down to the end of the land

When it gets out of hand and I beg to disagree
Just what's in it for me?
Get back down to the sea

And then I've got to run to the setting sun
Going down to the end of the land
If I've got to drive all night till the morning light
I'm going down to the end of the land

Ba da da da da, ba da da da da da
Going down, going down, going down to the end of the land
Ba da da da da, ba da da da da
Going down to the end of the land
