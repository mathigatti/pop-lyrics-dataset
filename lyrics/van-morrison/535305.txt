You're my woman
And you're my woman
You bore my child, Lord
You bore my child, Lord
I want to thank you
I want to thank you
And no one else will do
And no one else will do
And no one else will do
Baby, you, you are my sunshine
I am your guiding light
To like a ship out in the night
Returning for a light


I love you
I really love you
My heart is for you
My heart is for you
I long to feel you
I long to feel you
And every time I do
And every time I do
And every time I do
Baby, it's you, you are my sunshine
I am your guiding light
Just like a ship out in the night
Returning for a light, oh yeah

And it's really real
The way I feel
It's really real
Lord have mercy
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
And you realize
And you realize
Is really, really, really real

In Kingston town now
In Kingston town now
Walked up and down now
Looked at the ground now
You went in labor
You went in labor
And all our friends came through
And all our friends came through
And all out friends came through
Baby, it's you, you are my sunshine
I am your guiding light
Just like a ship out in the night
Returning for a light, oo-we

And it's really real
The way I feel
It's really real
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
And you realize
And you realize
It's really, really, really real, oh yeah
And you're my woman
And you're my woman
And you're my woman
And you're my woman...
