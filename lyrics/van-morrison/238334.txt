Little girl, little girl, little girl
You were on your way to school
Little girl, yes you were on your way to school
You went and broke
You went and broke your teacher's rule


I passed by your classroom
Just had to take a look
And I watched, looked
What you had writ' in your book
'Cause I love ya
And I don't care, what they say
I don't care what, what they say

I saw you from a window
Standing at the, the big oak tree
Stood and thought and wondered
How it used to be
Just-a you and me
In the golden sand
A-walkin', talkin', hand in hand
And I got you
Got you in my soul

In my
In my
In my
In my soul
In my soul

I need ya
An' I don't care what they say
Got you in my soul
14 years old

Oh baby

Oh in my soul, yeah

Yeah, hey hey
Oh, all right
