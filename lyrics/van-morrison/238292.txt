One of these days and it won't be long
You're gonna look for me an' I'll be gone
'Cause (I believe, yes I believe)
Said I believe right now
I believe, yes I believe
Oh, I believe to my soul
Tryin' to make a fool out of me


I believe it!
(I believe it)

Oh, goin' 'round here wit' yo' head so hard, huh
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod
'Cause I believe (I believe) yes I (believe)
Said I believe right now (I believe) yes I (believe)
Whoa-oh, I believe to my soul
Tryin' to make a fool outta me

(I believe it)
(I believe it)

Last night I was dreamin' and I got your plan
Saw you an' your girlfriend walkin' hand in hand
That's why I believe (I believe, I believe)
Said I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)
Whoa-whoa, I believe to my soul
Tryin' to make a fool outta me

I believe it !
(I believe it)

Last night I was dreamin' an' I dug your plan
Saw you an' your girlfriend walkin' hand in hand
And I believe, I believe yes (I believe)
Said I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)
Whoa-whoa, I believe to my soul
Tryin' to make a fool outta me

I believe it!
