I was educated by the school of hard knocks
Tell me who's gonna patronise me now?
They've brainwashed the suckers again and perpetrated the myth
Propaganda far and wide


No wavelength, no mileage
No current currency
No answers - just silence
And nothing is what it's supposed to be

I was educated by the school of hard knocks
Tell me who's gonna patronise me now?
I got shipwrecked and got stranded on the rocks
Everybody left me high and dry

I was educated by the school of hard knocks
Who's gonna patronise me now?
Brainwashed the suckers again and perpetrated the myth
Propaganda far and wide

No wavelength, no mileage
There's no current currency
No answers - only silence
Nothing looks like it's meant to be

I was educated by the school of hard knocks
Who's gonna patronise me now?
Just got shipwrecked and stranded on the rocks
And it left me high and dry

And it's left me sitting high and dry
And it left me sitting high and dry
And it left me sitting high and dry
