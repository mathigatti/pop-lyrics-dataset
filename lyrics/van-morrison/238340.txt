Ha!

This here's a story about, Lost John
Lost John done flew the coop!


Hee!

How many long gone?

Lost John standin' by the railroad track
Waitin' for the freight train to come back
Freight train came back and never made no stop
Lost John thought he'd have to ride on top

Well, he's long, long, long gone (woo-yeah)
And he's long, long, long gone

Yeah, lost John came into the country woman's house
Sat down there as quiet, just as quiet as a mouse
She said, 'Now Mister Lost John, be my friend
Be my friend up until the end.'

Well ('cause) he's long, long, long gone
(Well, l'm talkin' 'bout it)
Now he's long, long, long gone
(Yeah, came into the country woman's house)

Lost John came into a country woman's house
Sat there as quiet, quiet as a mouse
Said, 'Mister Lost John be my friend
Be my friend until the end.'

Well, I'm long, long, long gone
Well, I'm (he's) long, long, long gone

Yeah, she said
'Lost John a-don't you have no fear
I'm sending for the porter, gonna buy some beer'
He said, 'Now woman don't you buy no beer
The cop's is on my trail and-a soon be here'

Well, I'm long, long, long gone
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well, he's long, long, long gone

(Makin' a pair of shoes of his own)

Well, they caught Lost John
Put 'em in the pen
Summer break and gone
And now he's out again

If anybody asks you
Who sung this song
Tell 'em Lonnie Donegan
Been 'ere and gone

Well, he's long, long, long gone (ooone)
Well, he's long, long, long gone (one more time, ah)

Well, he's long, long, long gone
(He's goin', he's goin')
Well he's long, long, (long) gone
