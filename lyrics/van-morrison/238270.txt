Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
But me and my wife have parted
I'm gonna take another stroll downtown


Irene goodnight (goodnight Irene)
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll get you in my dream

Stop your ramblin'
Stop your gamblin'
Stop stayin' out late, late at night
Go home to your wife and your family
Sit down by your fireside so bright

Irene goodnight (Irene)
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll get you in my dream

I love Irene and I swear I do (yes)
Love 'er, love 'er, love 'er, love 'er, love 'er
Love 'er, love 'er, love 'er, love 'er
Still the sea runs dry
And if Irene ever turns her back on me
I'm gonna take morphine and die

Irene goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll get you in my dream
