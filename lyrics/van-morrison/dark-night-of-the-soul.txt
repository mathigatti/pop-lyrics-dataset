Something else don't stop that longing
Or something new or something old
I'm on my way to understanding
Things that I might yet not know


In the dark night of the soul
In the dark night of the soul

Sitting here but I didn't plan it
Well the plans of mice and men have gone astray
Standing here on the landing
Looking at a brand new day

In the dark night of the soul
In the dark night of the soul
In the dark night of the soul
In the dark night of the soul

Meditate on this and it will be revealed
Meditate on this and you will get healed
Meditate on this and you will feel whole
Get the vision of the ghost, again

In the dark night of the soul
In the dark night of the soul
In the dark night of the soul
In the dark night of the soul

Sitting here but I didn't plan it this way
Well the plans of mice and men have gone astray
Now I'm standing on the landing
I'm looking for a brand new day

In the dark night of the soul
In the dark night of the soul
