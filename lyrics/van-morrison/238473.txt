As you brush your shoes, you stand before your mirror
And you comb your hair, grab your coat and hat


And you walk the streets trying to remember, ee-yea
All those wild nights breeze through your mind

1-And every thing looks so complete
When you're walking down on the streets
And the wind, it catches your feet
Sets you flying, crying

Ooh ooh-ooh wee, wild night, is calling
Ooh ooh-ooh wee, wild night, is calling

All the girls walk by, dressed up for each other
And the boys, do the boogie-woogie
On the corner of the stree-ee-eet

And the people passing by, just stare with wild wonder, yea
And inside the juke box roars just like thunder
(repeat 1)

Wi-i-i-ild night, is calling
The wi-i-ild night a-is calling
C'mon out and dance, c'mon out and dance
C'mon out and make romance, c'mon out and dance
C'mon out and dance, c'mon out and make romance

Ooh ooh-ooh we the wild night, is calling
