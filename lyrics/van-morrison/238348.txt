Oh, she give me moonshine whiskey
Oh, she give me southern love
Deep in the heart of Texas
There beneath the stars above
Oh, she give me southern comfort
Oh, she give me moonshine love
Deep in the heart of Texas
There beneath the stars above


Here I am riding on a train
Just about thunderballs down the line
Just can't wait any longer
See that little darling of mine
See that little darling of mine

She's my Texas sweetheart
Part from Arkansas
Then we're dancing
Across the floor
And a band was playing
People were swayin', to and fro
Streamline promenade
Streamline promenade
And I said, "Wait a minute, 
Wait a minute, wait a minute
I'm gonna take a plane
Come with me tonight"
Gonna put on my hot pants
And promenade down funky broadway 
'Till the cows come home
La la la da...
Oh streamline promenade
Promenade streamline
Streamline promenade
Promenade streamline
Think I'm gonna promenade all night

Oh, she give me moonshine whiskey
Oh, she give me southern love
Deep in the heart of Texas
There beneath the stars above
Oh, she give me southern comfort
Oh, she give me moonshine love
Deep in the heart of Texas
There beneath the stars above

Listen, here we are
Thinking about time
When I resist here and now
And I just want to lie my feet 
On a river bed instead
Can't wait any longer
For the sign
I want to get down some time in the water

Watch the fish in the water
Bubbles, watch the bubbles come up in the water
Promenade streamline in the water
Streamline promenade, get funky
Promenade streamline, funky as you want to be
La da da...
Streamline promenade
Well, I feel alright tonight
Streamline promenade

Oh, she give me moonshine whiskey
Oh, she give me southern love
Oh, she give me moonshine whiskey
Oh, she give me southern love
She give me southern love
Child, she give me southern love...
