We were standing in the kingdom
And by the mansion gate
We stood enraptured by the silence
As the birds sang their heavenly song
In Tir Na Nog


We stopped in the church of Ireland
And prayed to our father
And climbed up the mountainside
With fire in our hearts
And we walked all the way to Tir Na Nog

I said with my eyes that
I recognized your chin
It was my long lost friend
To help me from another lifetime
We took each others hands and cried
Like a river when we said hello
And we walked to Tir Na Nog

We made a big connection
On a golden autumn day
We were standing in the garden wet with rain
And our souls were young again
In Tir Na Nog

And outside the storm was raging
Outside Jerusalem
We drove in our chariots of fire
Following the big sun in the west
Going up, going up, to
Tir Na Nog

You came into my life
And you filled me and you filled me
Oh so joyous
By the clear cool crystal streams
Where the roads were quiet and still
And we walked all the way
To Tir Na Nog

How can we not be attached
After all we're only human
The only way then is to never come back
Except I wouldn't want that would you
If we weren't together again
In Tir Na Nog

We've been together before
In a different incarnation
And we loved each other then as well
And we sat down in contemplation
Many many many times you kissed mine eyes
In Tir Na Nog
