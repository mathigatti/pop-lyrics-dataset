I put a spell on you
'Cause you're mine
Bi-a-do-ya, di-a-do-ya, dia-do-a, dia-do-a 
You better stop the things you do
And I ain't lyin', no I ain't lyin'


I can't stand it
Your runnin' around
You should know better mama
I can't stand it
Since you put me down

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

(Instrumental)

Do I love ya
Do I love ya
Do I love ya
Oh my
And always care if you don't want me
I said I'm yours right now

I put a spell on you
Because, bi-a-doot, di-a-doot, di-a-doo
You're mine
