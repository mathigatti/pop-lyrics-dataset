Man can be king
Seems to have everything
But it comes with a sting
When you were born to sing
Reason doesn't walk in
It's not done on a whim
Passion's everything
When you were born to sing


Feeling good
Singing the blues
It ain't easy
Keep on paying dues
When it gets to the part
Well let's not stop and start
Deep down in your heart
You know you were born to sing

When you came in
No original sin
You were a king
Because you were born to sing
Reason doesn't walk in
It's not done on a whim
Passion's everything
When you were born to sing
Lord, feeling good

Singing the blues
Keep on keeping on
Paying them dues
When it comes to the part
Well let's not stop and start
Deep down in your heart
Baby you were born to sing
When it gets to the part

When the band starts to swing
Then you know everything
'Cause you were born to sing
When it gets to the part
When the band starts to swing
Then you know everything
'Cause you were born to sing
