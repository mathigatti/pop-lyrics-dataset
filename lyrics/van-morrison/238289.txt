How long, how long baby,
Can this love of ours go on?
How long, how long baby,
'Cause I know, I know you've been doin' me wrong


You've been seen all over town
Playin' the field puttin' me down
How long can this go on?

How long, how long baby
Must you treat me like a fool? 
How long, how long baby,
Don't you know, you're breakin' the rules?

Do you think it's only a game?
The way that you're actin',
You'll drive me insane,
How long can this go on?

(Instrumental)

I wanna know, how long, how long baby,
Must you tear my soul apart?
How long, how long baby,
When you break, when you break my heart

Oh won't you, change your ways,
Come on back, let me hear you say
That we will start anew

I need you so, I need you so
I need you so, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
