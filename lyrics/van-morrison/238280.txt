Hello Josephine,
A how do you do?
Do you remember me baby,
Like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me
I was a fool, fool, fool


You used to shake it over yonder
A by the railroad track
A when it rained you couldn't walk
I had to tote ya on my back
It was a cryin' shame
You had to be like that

(Instrumental)

Hello Josephine,
A how do you do?
Do you remember me baby,
Just like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me
It was a cryin' shame

Whoa, Josephine
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Whoa, sayin'
Hey now
Whoa, Josephine
A what a cryin' shame
