And it goes out, and it comes back
It is a feeling it's a feelin'
And when you do it
And the more you do it
And the more you do it
It becomes a beautiful obsession
A beautiful obsession
A beautiful a beautiful obsession, obsession, yeah


It's a feelin'
It's a feelin'
It's a feelin'
In your heart, in your soul
In your being, yeah
It's a beautiful obsession
And it makes you feel
And it's more than a song to sing
And it's more, more, more
Than a song to sing

Let the cowboy ride
Let the cowboy ride
Let the cowboy ride
