Don't get around much anymore
The smoke has driven me out the door
All night I used to walk the floor
Don't go to nightclubs anymore


Don't see my old friend Mose
I don't run into Mr. Clive
I cut out all that off the wall jive
I don't go to nightclubs no more

I'm not a legend in my own mind
Don't need juice to unwind
And don't have no need to pretend
Ain't got no huckleberry friend

Alcohol was too big a price
Listen I just said no dice
When it comes to the men and the mice
Don't go to nightclubs anymore

I'm not a legend in my own mind
Don't need booze to unwind
Don't have no reason to pretend
Ain't got no huckleberry friend

Alcohol was too big a price
That why I said hey no dice
When it comes to men or mice
Don't go to nightclubs no more

Don't go to nightclubs no more
Don't go to nightclubs no more
Don't go to nightclubs no more, I'm such a bore
Don't go to nightclubs no more
