I've been on this roller coaster just too many times
And always it seems like
The blind keep on leading the blind
Tried to get them on the 'phone
Tried to find my way back home
Tned and failed, and tried and failed, again


But baby I don't want you 'cos you look so good
I don't want you 'cos I know I should
I don't want you to come in f rom the rain
I want you to be my ball and chain
I want you to be my ball and chain

Ah just lately I've been roaming from town to town
I've been setting them up, setting them up
And I've been knocking them down

I was born to live, it seems, a fugitive dream
Make things always better than they seem
And I stop and start, and stop and start
And stop and start again

Baby I don't want you for your money
I don't want you 'cos I love you honey
I don't want you to ease this memory pain
No, I want you to be my ball and chain
Yes, I want you to be my, be my ball and chain

When I see you in the garden once again
Baby you'll be standing in the summer rain
Laugh and cry and say what it's all about
You can even jump and shout
And you'll smile and say how are you again
I don't want you 'cos I'm so blue
I don't want you 'cos you know what to do
I don't want you because all my love seems in vain

I want you to be my ball and chain
I want you to be my ball and chain
I want you to be my ball and chain
I want you to be my ball and chain
Oh, be my ball and chain
Be my ball and chain, be my ball and chain
Oh, be my ball and chain
I want you.....ball and chain, etc.
