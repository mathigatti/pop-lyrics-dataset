Good mornin' blues, blues how do ya do?
Good mornin' blues, blues how do ya do?
Well I'm doin' alright this mornin', how are you?


I woke up this mornin'
Couldn't get outta my bed
Oh I woke up this mornin'
Couldn't get you outta my bed
Went to eat my breakfast and
The blues was all in my bread

Good mornin' blues, blues how do you do?
Good mornin' blues, blues how do you do?
Well I'm doin' alright this mornin' how are you?

Well the blues ain't nothin' but a poor workin' man feelin' down
Lord, the blues ain't nothin' but a poor workin' man feelin' down
That's about the meagerest feelin' I done ever had

Why I'm singin' good mornin', blues blues how do you do?
(yeah yeah)
Good mornin' blues, blues how do you do? (yeah yeah)
Well I'm doin' alright this mornin', how are you?

[Instrumental- piano]

Sent for you yesterday, here you come walkin' today (hey)
I sent for you yesterday, here you come walkin' today
Yeah, your mouth's wide open
You don't know what to say

(I say) Goodmornin' blues, blues how do you do? (yo yeah)
Well goodmornin' blues, blues how do you do? (hoo yeah)
Well I'm doin' alright, blues how are you?
Yeeeeeaaaah!
