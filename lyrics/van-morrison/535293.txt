A well money's gettin' cheaper
Price is gettin' steeper
I found a little woman
But I just couldn't keep her


Times gettin' tougher than tough
Times gettin' rougher than rough
Well I make alot of money
I just keep spendin' the stuff

Oh well pork chops on the market
Ask the butcher for a pound
I couldn't get no pork chop
When I laid my money down

Times gettin' tougher than tough
Times gettin' rougher than rough
Well I make alot of money
I just keep spendin' the stuff

(Instrumental)

Oh well the politicans say
Get the people on their feet
They wanna cut the price
And let the people eat

Times gettin' tougher than tough
The times gettin' rougher than rough
But I make alot of money
Just keep spendin' the stuff

Well I can't afford to live
I guess I'll have to try
Undertakers got a union
And it cost too much to die

Times gettin' tougher than tough
Well times gettin' rougher than rough
Well I make alot of money
Just keep spendin' the stuff
