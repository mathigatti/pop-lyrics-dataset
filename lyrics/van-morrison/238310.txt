If you only knew all the problems
That a man like me has to face.
If you only knew all the silly
Things that keep a man from his place.
I wouldn't want to sing your own song.
Your gonna have to lose a few.
If you only knew.


If you only knew all the dealing
That goes on in back of the store.
If you only knew how that one that's
Got a lot can't wait to get more.
I wouldn't want to cramp your style
But if you want to make it all worthwhile.
You have to have your own breakthrough.
If you only knew.

If you only knew what could happen to
A man for telling the truth.
If you only knew all the scruples
That go down in gin and vermouth.
I wouldn't want to steer you wrong
But if you want to sing your own song.
Your gonna have to lose a few.
If you only knew.
