Say you wanna be in showbusiness
See the man on the tv with a phoney smile
Bring you up, bring you down
He can turn your head around
In showbusiness, showbusiness
See the man on a silver screen
With the phoney smile


Bring you up, bring you down
He can turn your head around
Showbusiness, showbusiness
Have a hit, maybe two
Make mincemeat out of you
Come back in two years time
Lay your heart right on the line

In showbusiness, showbusiness
Showbusiness, showbusiness
Where's the next one, where's the next one
Where's the next one
Oh, baby just like the last one
Like the last one
Say you wanna be in showbusiness

See the man in the suit
With the phoney smile
He can laugh, he can cry
He can make you reach the sky,
He can say anything you wanna hear
Be anything you wanna be
You can say anything you want to hear
Be anything you want him to be
Make you leave your family
In showbusiness, in showbusiness

Take it to the bridge
And the next one, and the next one
And the next one
How can you do it like the last one
Now do it just like the last one, please
Like the last one, like the last one just like the last one
Say you wanna be in showbusiness
Have a pretty face and a pretty smile
I'm thinking

Make you laugh and they can make you cry
But they can't wait, wipe the tear drops from your eye
In showbusiness, showbusiness
Say you wanna be in showbusiness
See the rock star up on the stage
Right now
Behind them drugs, behind them booze

Behind them people he can use
Behind them people usin' them
Behind them people usin' us
And the next one, and the next one
And the next one
Can you make it, just like the last one
Oh, you make it just like the last one

Like the last one
Just like the last one
Say you wanna be in showbusiness
All the world is a stage
Everybody must play their part,
I've been so long in showbusiness
I feel right now just like I got myself just started
Forget the junk, forget the jive

I just want to stay alive
In showbusiness, in showbusiness
Take it to the bridge
And the next one, and the next one
And the next one
Oh, just like the last one, just like the last one
Like the last one
They can rob you with a fountain pen
But you got to find some honest men
They can make you leave your home

Where you go to waste and roam
Control your fate, control your life
They can make you leave your wife
It's showbusiness, it's showbusiness
Take it to the bridge
And the next one, and the next one
And the next one

Oh, just like the last one, can you make it
Like the last one
Can you give it one more time
Like the last one
Can you put it out, like the last one
Showbusiness, it's showbusiness
It's showbusiness, showbusiness
It's showbusiness, showbusiness
