If in money we trust
If in money we trust
And you bite the dust
And it's not enough
If in money you trust
But it's not enough
And you bite the dust
If in money you trust


Where's God?
Where's God?
Where's God?
Where's God?
If in money we trust
If in money we trust
No substitute
No substitute
No substitute
When God is dead
And it's not enough

Then in money you trust
Then they call the bluff
When God is dead
And money's not enough
In what do you trust
When it's not enough?
Where's God?
Where's God?
Where's God?
Where's God?

When God is dead
And it's not enough
What substitute
What substitute
When God is dead
And it's not enough
When God is dead
And it's not enough

If in money you trust
If in money you trust
But it's not enough
Then you call the bluff
Where's God?
Where's God?
Where's God?
Where's God?
No substitute
No substitute

You've got to think it through again
You've got to think it through again
You've got to think it through again
You've got to think it through again
Got to think it through again
You got to think it through again
Got to think it through again
Got to think it through again
