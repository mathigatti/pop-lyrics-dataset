You came to see me when the moon was new
Saw you standin' in the pouring rain
Left my message on the window pain
Back on the street again
Back on the beat again
I'm back on the top again 


Saw me climbing to the top of the hill
You saw me meeting with the fools on the hill
Learned my lesson and I had my fill
Learnt it all in vain
Went through it all again
Now I'm back on the top again 

Always strivin', always climbing way beyond my will
Same old sensation, isolation at the top of the bill
Always seeming, like I'm moving but I'm really going slow
What do you do when you get to the top and there's nowhere to go 

Just how I get there will be anybody's guess
With all the so called trappings of success
Left all the deadbeats on the top of the hill
Too busy raisin' Cain
I'm back on the street again
I'm back on the top again 

Always strivin', always climbing way beyond my will
It's the same old sensation, isolation at the top of the hill
Always seeming, like I'm moving but I'm really going slow
You'll find out when you get to the top that there's nowhere to go 

How you get there will be anybody's guess
With all the so called trappings of success
Left all the deadbeats on the top of the hill
Too busy raisin' Cain
I'm back on the street again
I'm back on the top again 

Back on my feet again
I'm back on the street again
I'm back on the top again
