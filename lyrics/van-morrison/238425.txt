Look down - look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on


Look up - look up
And seek your maker
Before (Mr.) Gabriel blows his horn

(I'm) Weary (of) toting - such a (heavy) load
Trudging down - the (that) lonesome road

Look down - look down
That lonesome road
Before (before) you travel on

True love - true love
What have I done
That you should treat me so

You - caused me 
To walk and talk
Like I never did before

(I'm) Weary (of) toting - such a (heavy) load
Trudging down - the (that) lonesome road

Look down - look down (look down - look down)
That lonesome road
Before (before) you (decide to) travel on
