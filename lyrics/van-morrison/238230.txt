Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
That old storm brewin' in this heart of mine
Someday, your crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now, I'm so lonesome all the time


Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While your yearnin' heart keeps sayin'
You're not mine (not mine)

My troubled mind grows blue
To another, you'll be wed
But now I'm so lonesome, all the time

Now take all those precious dreams
I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday, your crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now, I'm so lonesome all the time

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
But my yearnin' heart keeps sayin'
You're not mine (not mine)
My troubled mind grows blue
To another you'll be wed
And now I'm so lonesome all the time

And now, I'm so lonesome all the time
Yeah, now I'm so lonesome all the time
