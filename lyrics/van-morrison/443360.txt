Me and my daddy was comin' into town
(Sail away lady sail away)
Round the billygoat leadin' a hound 
(Sail away lady sail away)
Hound got dumped, billygoat jumped
(Sail away lady sail away)
Throw'd my brother right over that stump
(Sail away lady sail away)


Don't you rock me daddio
Don't you rock me daddio
Don't you rock me daddio
Don't you rock me daddio

Don't you rock me daddio
Don't you rock me daddio
Don't you rock me daddio
Don't you rock me daddio

Well my old auntie promised me
(Sail away lady sail away)
When she'd die she'd will to me
(Sail away lady sail away)
She lived so long her head got bald
(Sail away lady sail away)
She got out the notes and the dimes and all
(Sail away lady sail away)

Don't you rock me daddio
Don't you rock me daddio
Don't you rock me daddio

Well my old auntie promised me
(Sail away lady sail away)
When she'd die she'd will to me

Well, she lived so long her head got bald
