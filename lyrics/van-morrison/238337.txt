Look here, what you think you gon' be doin' next year
No lie, how you know you no gon' up and die
No doubt, soon enough your friends will find you out
Take care you know you might not have much time to spare


I say, how long have you acted up this way
What know, when you gonna get your own floor show
I'm hip, you could use a button on your lip
Look here, what you think you gon' be doin' next year
