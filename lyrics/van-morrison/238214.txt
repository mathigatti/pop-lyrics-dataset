When this old world has let you down
And friends no longer want you around
When you feel burdened down with care
And troubles seem so hard to bear


Call my name hear me talkin' to ya baby
Call my name, yeah-hey-yeah, call my name
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
And I'll be there

When everything that you try has failed
And you never even get no mail
When life to you seems such a bore
And blues come calling 'round your door

Call my name hear me talkin' to ya baby
Call my name, yeah-yeah-yeah, call my name
Whoa oh oh oh yeah
Yeah, I'll be there

(Instrumental)

If you feel that you're all alone
And sick inside away from home
When you no longer want to try
Or care if you should live or die

Call my name hear me talkin' to ya baby
Call my name, yeah-yeah-yeah, and I'll be there
Right there, where I belong
FADES
All you gotta do is call me
All you gotta do is call me
