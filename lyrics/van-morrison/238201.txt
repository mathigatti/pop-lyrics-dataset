My message this evenin'
Is simple indeed
Wherever you wander
Whatever your breed
There's just one thing baby
That comes from above
When push comes to shove
Thank God for self love


Thank Him, Thank Him
God for self love
Thank Him, Thank Him
God for self love
When push comes to shove
Thank God for self love

When livin' gets heavy
And hope starts to fade
You just can't continue
That old masquerade
Remember the power that comes from above
When push comes to shove
Thank God for self love

Thank Him, Thank Him
God for self love
Thank Him, Thank Him
God for self love
When push comes to shove
Thank God for self love
