("This is gonna be nice, this is gonna be very nice")


Sailed on the Sloop John B
My granddaddy and me
'Round Nassau town we did roam
We'd been drinkin' all night
Well I got into a fight
Yeah and I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

Hoist up the John B sail's
See how the mainsail sets
Send for the Captain ashore
And let me go home
I wanna go home, I wanna go home, yeah
'Cause I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
Yes I do
(He's so broke up, Lord, I wanna go home)

Well Captain's a wicked man
He gets drunk any time he can
And he don't give a damn for grandpappy
No, nor me
He kicks us around
And he knocks us about
Well I feel so broke up, I
I wanna go home

Well pull up the John B's sails
See how the mainsail sets
Send for the Captain ashore
And let me go home
I wanna go home
Well, I wanna go home
'Cause I feel so broke up (he's so broke up)
I wanna go home
(Yes I do)
I feel so broke up
(He so broke up)
Lord, that I wanna go home
Home
