Here she comes on a midnight train
She says she's gotta see me again 
She's so young, I know I should send her away
Leave me alone, I say, leave me alone
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Well I feel so broke up, I'm choked up
Go on home, baby


Her hair hangs down so straight
When she moves she looks so great
And nobody else's lips have touched hers, but mine
Leave me alone, I say, leave me alone
Yeah-yeah-yeah
I feel so broke up, I'm choked up
Go on home, baby

Please leave me alone, my baby
Our love is through
Your daddy called me and he says
I'm much too old for you
Please don't cry, oh my baby
Please don't cry, what can I do?

She's walkin' back to the train
Ain't never gonna see her again
I should run, whoa-yeah, and stop her I know
She's goin' home yeah-yeah
She's goin' home and all I say
Well, I feel so broke up, I'm choked up
Go on home, baby

Go on home, baby (I'm so broke up)
I don't wanna see ya 'round (I'm choked up)
FADES-
Around here, no more (I'm broke up baby)
Stay away from my door (I'm so choked up)
