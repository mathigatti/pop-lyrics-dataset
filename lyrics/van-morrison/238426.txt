Let go into the mystery
Let yourself go
You've got to open up your heart
That's all I know
Trust what I say and do what you're told
Baby, and all your dirt will turn
Into gold 


Let go into the mystery
Let yourself go
And when you open up your heart
You get everything you need
Baby there's a way and a mystic road
You've got to have some faith
To carry on

You've got to open up your heart
To the sun
You know he's looking out for you
'Cause he's the one

Let go into the mystery
Let yourself go
There is no other place to be
Baby this I know
You've got to dance and sing
And be alive in the mystery
And be joyous and give thanks
And let yourself go

I saw the light of ancient Greece
Towards the One
I saw us standing within reach
Of the sun
Let go into the mystery of life
Let go into the mystery
Let go into the mystery
Let yourself go

You've got to open up your arms
To the sun
You know you've got so many charms
It's just begun
Trust what I say and do
What you're told
And surely all your dirt will turn into gold
