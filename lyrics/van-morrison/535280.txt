More and more
I'm forgetting the past
More and more
I'm living at last
Day by day
I'm losing my blues
More and more
I'm forgetting about you


And oh how I tried to keep you by my side
And oh how I cried the day you said goodbye
Day by day
I'm losing my blues
More and more
I'm forgetting about you

But oh how I tried to keep you by my side
And oh how I cried the day you said goodbye
Day by day
I'm losing my blues
More and more
I'm forgetting about you

Day by day
I'm losing my blues
More and more
I'm forgetting about you
