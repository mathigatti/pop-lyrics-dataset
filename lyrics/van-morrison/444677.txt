I tried to tell her mama, but she wouldn't hear what I said. 


So long pretty baby, you're gonna need my help someday,
So long pretty baby, you're gonna need my help someday.
You're gonna wish you had listened to something that I had to say. 

Go on, pretty baby, and knock yourself out,
Go ahead, pretty baby, you don't know what love is all about.
