Fill me my cup
And I'll drink your sparkling wine
Pretending everything is fine
Till I see your sad eyes


Throw me a kiss
Across a crowded room
Some sunny windswept afternoon
There's none too soon for me to miss
My sad eyes
Woh oh ou, not bad eyes
A glad eyes, but you my sad eyes

Fortunate and free
And there go you and I
Between the other sky
But who are you and I
To wonder why we do so
My sad eyes - lonely

Oh what a story
Come on in all it's glory
This song that I sing in everything
For you my sad eyes

You'd better fill me my cup
And I'll drink your sparkling wine
Pretending everything is fine
Till I see your sad eyes
Woh oh ou, not bad eyes
A glad eyes, but you my sad eyes
Lonely sad eyes

Fill me my cup
And I'll drink your sparkling wine
Pretending everything is fine
Till I see your sad eyes

Throw me a kiss
Across a crowded room
Some sunny windswept afternoon
There's none too soon for me to miss
My sad eyes
Oh, not bad eyes
But glad eyes, you my sad eyes

Fortunate and free
And there go you and I
Between the other sky
But who are you and I
To wonder why we do so
My sad eyes, yeah yeah

Oh what a story
Come on in all it's glory
This song that I sing in everything
For you my sad eyes

You fill me my cup
And I'll drink your sparkling wine
Pretending everything is fine
For you my sad eyes
Oh, not bad eyes
But glad eyes, it's you that I [ sa.....ile ?! ]
Ah, sad - lord, sad eyes - sad eyes
