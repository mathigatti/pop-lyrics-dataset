Sent to Coventry feels like hell
This ain't no place to get well
Sent to Coventry once again
Break out of this empty shell
Start all over somewhere else
Somewhere much stronger than this
Somewhere I can be myself
'Stead of sittin' on the shelf


Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is

There's just this wall of hate
Of some twisted fate
'Cause I can't be a part
Somethin' that doesn't have no heart
Save myself, save the other
Right now, run for cover
Try to start another dream
And stop this empty scheme

Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is

Sent to Coventry feels like hell
This ain't no place to get well
Sent to Coventry once again
Got to break out of this empty shell
Start all over somewhere else
Somewhere much stronger than this
Somewhere I can be myself
'Stead of sittin' on the shelf

Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is
Go where the love is
Yeah, yeah, go where the love is
Yeah, yeah, go where the love is
Gotta go, gotta gotta
Gotta gotta gotta
Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is
Got to go where the love is
