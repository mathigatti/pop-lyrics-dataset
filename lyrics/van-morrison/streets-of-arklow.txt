And as we walked
Through the streets of arklow
Oh the color
Of the day wore on
And our heads
Were filled with poetry
And the morning
A-comin' on to dawn
And as we walked


Through the streets of arklow
And gay perfusion
In God's green land
And the gypsy's rode
With their hearts on fire
They say "we love to wander,"
"Lord we love,"
"Lord we love to roam..."
And as we walked

Through the streets of arklow
In a drenching beauty
Rolling back 'til the day
And I saw your eyes
They was shining, sparkling crystal clear
And our souls were clean
And the grass did grow

And our souls were clean
And the grass did grow
And our souls were clean
And the grass did grow
And as we walked
Through the streets of arklow
