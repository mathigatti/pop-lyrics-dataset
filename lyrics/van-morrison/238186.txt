And we'll walk down the avenue again
And we'll sing all the songs from way back when
And we'll walk down the avenue again and the healing has begun


And we'll walk down the avenue in style
And we'll walk down the avenue and we'll smile
And we'll say baby ain't it all worthwhile when the healing has begun

I want you to put on your pretty summer dress
You can wear your Easter bonnet and all the rest
And I wanna make love to you yes, yes, yes when the healing has begun

When you hear the music ringin' in your soul
And you feel it in your heart and it grows and grows
And it comes from the backstreet rock &amp; roll and the healing has begun
I want you to put on your pretty summer dress
You can wear your Easter bonnet and all the rest
And I wanna make love to you yes, yes, yes and the healing has begun

We're gonna make music underneath the stars
We're gonna play to the violin and the two guitars
We're gonna sit there and play for hours and hours when the healing has begun

[Spoken:] Wait a minute, listen, listen,
I didn't know you stayed up so late.
I just got home from a gig and I saw
you standing on the street.
Just let me move on up to this window-sill a lot yeah, I got some sherry.
You want a drop of port.
Let's move behind this door here.
Let's move on up behind this letter-box behind this door.
Let's go in your front room,
let's play this Muddy Waters record you got there,
if you just open up a little bit
and let me ease on in this backstreet jellyroll....

We're gonna stay out all night long
And then we're gonna go out and roam across the field
Baby you know how I feel when the healing has begun

When the healing, when the healing
We're gonna stay out all night long
We're gonna dance to the rock &amp; roll
When the healing when the healing has begun
Baby just let me ease on a little bit, dig this backstreet jellyroll
