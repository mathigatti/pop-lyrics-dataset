Look at the ivy on the cold clinging wall
Look at the flowers and the green grass so tall
It's not a matter of when push comes to shove
It's just an hour on the wings of a dove 


I dig it when you're fancy dressed up in lace
I dig it when you have a smile on your face
This inspiration's got to be on the flow
This invitation's got to see it and know 

It's just warm love
It's just warm love
And it's everpresent everywhere
And it's everpresent everywhere
That warm love 

To the country I'm going
Lay and laugh in the sun
You can bring, bring your guitar along
We'll sing some songs, we'll have some fun 

The sky is crying and it's time to go home
And we shall hurry to the car from the foam
Sit by the fire and dry out our wet clothes
It's raining outside from the skies up above 

Inside it's warm love
Inside it's warm love
And it's everpresent everywhere
And it's everpresent everywhere
Warm love
Warm love
