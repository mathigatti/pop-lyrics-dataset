Open the door to your heart
Open the door to your soul
Get back in the flow
Open the door to your heart
Money doesn't make you fulfilled
Money's just to pay the bills
It's need not greed


Open the door to your heart
You've got eyes to see
And ears to hear
Then why don't you quit
Crying in your beer my dear
If nobody gets what they want
Tell me what's the use in that
Everybody just get's fat

Open the door to your heart
Backbiters always make mistakes
If you want to get an even break
Think of everything that's at stake
Open the door to your heart
Don't you think I know who my enemies are
Their slip is showing and the door is ajar
Well this time they pushed me too far

Open the door to your heart
If you've got eyes to see
And ears to hear
You better quit, quit
Crying in your beer my dear
If you can't hear the song you're wrong
I've been around too long
Just listen to the words that's all

Open the door to your heart
Open the door to your heart
Open the door to your soul
Got to get back in the flow
Open the door to your heart
Come on
Yeah, yeah, open the door to your heart
Open the door to your soul
Get back in the flow
Open the door to your heart

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Open the door to your heart
Open the door to your soul
Got to get back in the flow now
Open the door to your heart
Come on, come on, come on, come on come on
Da, da-da, da da, da da-da da da
Open the door to your heart
Yeah, yeah
