That's life
That's what the people say
You're riding high in April
Shot down in May
I know I've got to change my tune
When I get back up on top in June


That's life
Funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks from stepping on a dream
I don't let it get me down
This big old world keeps spinning round

Chorus:
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up, down, over and out
And I know one thing
Every time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life
I can't deny it
I thought of quitting but my heart wouldn't buy it
If I don't think it's worth a try
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die

[Chorus]

[Last verse]

Bye bye
Bye bye
