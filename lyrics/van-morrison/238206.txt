The photographer smiles
Take a break for a while
Take a rest, do your very best
Take five, honey
You search in your bag
Light up a fag
Think it's a drag, but you're so glad
To be alive honey
Hey when this is all over
You'll be in clover
We'll go out and spend
All of your blue money
Do do you do . . . etc.
Well the cameraman smiles
Take a break for a while
Do your best, do your very best
Take five, honey
You search in your bag
Light up a fag
Say it's a drag, but you're so glad
To be alive honey
When this is all over
You'll be in clover
We'll go on out and spend
All of your blue money
Do do you do . . . etc.
Blue money
Breau money
Juice money
Loose money
Blue money, honey
Breau money.
