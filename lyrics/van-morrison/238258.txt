I just can't seem to take much more of this
Got too much hassle baby and not enough bliss
Got to give these hangers on a miss
'Cos I need some help I just don't get


No one seems to understand what's up
What's up, what's up
So called friends come and go
And things just don't add up
Trying to make my way
Through all this illusion and myth
I don't even have no safety net

Nero fiddled while Rome burnt
Napoleon met his Waterloo
Sampson went spare when Delilah cut his hair
But little David slew Goliath too

I'm just trying to get some results
Listen baby I'm not trying to start my own cult
Please tell me something that I don't know
I just wanna get on with the show

Nero fiddled while Rome burnt
Napoleon met his Waterloo
Sampson went spare when Delilah cut his hair
But little David slew Goliath too

You'd think some program might do the trick
Let me tell you this wall of fog
Is just too thick
I thought of everything but the whip
But baby nobody on my ship is up to it

I'm just trying to get some results, some results
I'm not trying to start my own cult, no ..
Just tell me something that I don't know
I just wanna get on with the show

I just wanna get on with the show
Just tell me something that I don't know
I just wanna get on with the show
And if it don't work then let it go
