On the road with my sword
And my shield in my hand
Pressing on to the new day
This love will surely last forever
This love will surely last always


In the valley I see horsemen pass
Baby, baby, baby they don't want this love to last
There's a battle for the throne

And it's raging down in your soul
It says this love will surely last forever
This love will surely last always

Bridge:
I've been accused of truth and alchemy
I've been accused of speaking out for freedom too
I gave a demonstration in front of a crowd
A man saw my hands move and he began to shout

Here come horsemen through the pass
They say cast a cold eye on life, on death
There's a battle for the throne
And it means to thine own self be true

And it says this love will surely last forever
This love will surely last always
