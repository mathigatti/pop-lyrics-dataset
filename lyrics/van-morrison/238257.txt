Georgia, Georgia,
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Oh, on my mind, on my mind


Well, well, well, well, well I say hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Georgia,
Just the thought of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As the moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
For that peaceful dreams I see
The road, the road, the road, the road, the road, the road, the road, the road, the road, the road, the road,
Leads back to you

Ohh, say that Georgia
No peace, no peace, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps you, keeps you, keeps you
Gentle on my mind

[Instrumental break]

Your arms your arms your arms your arms your arms your arms your arms your arms reach out to me
Your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes smile tenderly
For that peaceful, for that peaceful dreams I see
Oh the hardened ground and road
Lead back to you

Georgia
No, no, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Just an old sweet, just an old sweet, just an old sweet song

Keeps you, keeps you, on my mind, on my mind, on my mind

Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
On my mind, on my mind.
