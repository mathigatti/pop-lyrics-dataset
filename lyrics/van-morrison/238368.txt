Once in a blue moon
Something good comes along
Once in a blue moon
Everything's not going wrong
When you get weary
Beating on the same old gong
Once in a blue moon
Someone like you comes along


Once every once in a while
Something comes along that feels just right
Once every once in a while
Just like switching on an electric light
And sometimes you try till you're blue in the face
But when you get that feeling
Nothing's going to take its place

Once in a blue moon
There's a thing called happiness
It happens when you're in
A state of natural grace

When the wind is blowing
All around the fence
I get that happy feeling
Things start making sense
All just feels so lucky
That you just can't go wrong
Once in a blue moon
Someone like you comes along

Once in a blue moon
There's a thing called happiness
It happens when you're in
A state of natural grace

When the grass is growing
All around the fence
And you get that happy feeling
Everything starts making sense
And you get so lucky
That you can't go wrong

Once in a blue moon
Something comes along
Once in a blue moon
Someone like you comes along
Once in a blue moon
Something good comes along
Once in a blue moon
Someone like you comes along
