Mystic of the east, mystic from the streets
Mystic with no brief, back here on the street
Mystic out of reach, can't find no reason to speak
I just got in too deep for the mystic of the east


I was deep in the heart of down
Deep in the heart of down
Deep in the heart of down
Deep in the heart
Mystic with no peace, back here in the east
Fed up to the teeth, mystic of the east
I was deep in the heart of down

Deep in the heart of down
Deep in the heart of down
Deep in the heart
Mystic out of reach
Can't seem to find my brief
Gone with the wild geese
And I've had it up to the teeth
Mystic of the east, back here on the streets

Mystic with no brief
I can't find any reason to speak
Mystic of the east, east, east, east
Back here on the street, back on the street
Back on the street, mystic of the east
Back here on the street, mystic of the east
