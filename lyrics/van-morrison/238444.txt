It's four o'clock in the morning, and there's a new full moon
Shining down through the trees
But don't leave the room now, leave it in doubt
Pretend not to know what I'm talking about
I try, all night long
I try, I want you to come along


I feel it when you touch me, I'm already wet
But how are you supposed to know what you get
Wake me when it's over, but don't turn on the light
Call me by name, that's alright I try, all night long,
Ooh, I try to carry on

And, how can you go through, how can you go through
So many changes
Oh, how can you go through, how can you go through
So many changes
It's a family affair; it's a family affair
It's a family affair, it's a family affair, it's a family affair
Try for sleep, why don't you try for sleep
Why don't you try for sleep

I'm pushin' the river, ready to roll
Oh, I can feel it in my soul
Give me the high light and leave out the rest
You know what they told me
They said the west is best
I try, all night long, I try to get along with
Will try for sleep, ooh try for sleep
Won't you, oh won't you come along, come along
Try for sleep, try for sleep
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, yaaa
I want you to try for sleep
I know you will try, ooh baby
Ooh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
