Train down to St. Louis
Get me there alright
Over to the city there, you know that one
Where the farmer's daughter digs the farmer's son
Dig your Charlie Parker
Basie and Young
Witherspoon and Jay McShann
They will come
Oooowoooowoooo

Lady Liberty in waiting
You know she lights the way
Her name is Billie, she's a Holiday
And the city is eternal -- hey, can't you see?
It's inside of you and it's inside of me
Oooowoooowoooo
