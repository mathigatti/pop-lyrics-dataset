I can't give you more than what I've got
I can't expect to give what I have not
I-I-I can only give ya lovin' 'till the sun goes down
And, until the leaves of summer turn to shades of brown


I try and I try
But baby, you know that I
Can only give you evra'thing

I can't argue with you to a-understand
'Cause afterall, I am just a man
A you-ooo-ooo are on my mind
When stars appear and shadows fall
And when ev'ra little flower close
And no birds call
I try and I try
But baby, you know that I
Can only give you evra'thing

(Instrumental)

I'll do anything you want me to do
'Cause I don't want to know there's life without you
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
Don't ever go and leave me in this world alone
I-I-I'd be like a little child if I was on my own

I try and I try
But baby you know that I
Can only give you evra'thing

Evra'thing, baby
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
And evra'thing
Ooh, ooh, ooh
FADES
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Whoa, ooh, ooh
Whoa, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
