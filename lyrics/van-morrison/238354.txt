I'm walkin' down the street
I'm on that midnight beat
I'm on a lonely avenue
Baby, won't you walk with me
Baby, won't you talk with me
Oh that's all I want you to do, now
Walk with me
Talk to me
Call your name out


[Chorus:]
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na, Natalia
Here on a summer night
I wanna kiss and hold you tight
Just the way we used to do
Walkin' down the same old street
People that we used to meet
Such a long, long time ago, now
Walk with me
Talk to me
And I call out your name

[Chorus x2]

On a magic night like this
I hunger for your kiss
On a magic night like this

[Chorus]

Walk with me
Talk with me
Walk with me
Talk with me
Natalia, Natalia, Natalia
Natalia, Natalia, Natalia
