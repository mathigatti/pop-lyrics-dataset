Across the bridge where angels dwell
Across the bridge where angels
Across the bridge where angels dwell
Children play


Beyond the place where time is still
Beyond the place where time is
Beyond the place where time is still
Night is day

Close your eyes in fields of wonder
Close your eyes and dream
Close your eyes in fields of wonder
Close your eyes and dream

Along the path where heaven lies
Along the path where heaven
Along the path where heaven lies
All is clear

Ahead where home awaits the heart
Ahead where home is waiting
Ahead where home awaits the heart
Peace is near

Close your eyes in fields of wonder
Close your eyes and dream
Close your eyes in fields of wonder
Close your eyes and dream

Across the bridge where angels dwell
Across the bridge where angels
Across the bridge where angels dwell
Children play

[repeat]
