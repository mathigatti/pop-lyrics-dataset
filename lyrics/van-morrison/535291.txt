This love of mine goes on and on
Though life is empty since you have gone
You're always on my mind though out of sight
It's lonesome through the day but oh, the lonely nights


I cry my heart out, it's bound to break
Since nothing matters just let it break
I ask the sun and the moon and the stars that shine
What's to become of it?
This love of mine

I cry my heart out, it's bound to break
But since nothing matters go ahead and let it break
I ask the sun and the moon and all the stars that shine
What's to become of it?
What's to become of it?
What's to become of it?
This love of mine
