Girl, you're my sunshine,
take away the raindrops,
you make it all worthwhile,
make all the pain stop.
Just like a river,
keep love flowin',
don't let our world stop,
gotta keep it goin'.
Well, I love you just the way you are,
honey, don't change on me,
don't change on me,
don't change on me, yeah.
Girl, you're my lucky star,
honey, don't change on me,
don't change on me,
I said, don't ya' change on me.


I used to wonder
where would I ever find
a-some kinda happiness and peace of mind.
I was lured by the darkness,
and then you came,
bringin' the sunshine,
easin' the pain.
I love ya' just the way you are,
honey, don't change on me,
don't change on me,
I said, don't change on me.
Girl,
girl, you're my lucky star,
honey, don't change on me,
don't change on me,
Lord, don't ya' change on me.

If there's a heaven,
then this is my prayer,
I wanna know,
I wanna know if we will meet there,
and there forever
[won't] get together
in the sunshine,
no more stormy weather.
Well, I love ya' just the way you are,
honey, don't change on me,
don't you change on me,
don't you change on me.
Girl,
girl, you're my lucky star,
baby, don't change on me,
don't change on me,
don't ya' change.
I love ya'
just the way you are,
I love ya' just the way you are,
love ya' just the way you are.
Girl, you're my lucky star,
don't change on me,
yeah, don't change on me.

[Yeah, I don't know, a little bit out.]
