Copycats ripped off my words
Copycats ripped off my songs
Copycats ripped off my melody
It doesn't matter what they say
It doesn't matter what they do
All that matters is my relationship to you


Gonna take you out
Get you in my car
We're going for a long long drive
We're going down to A Town Called Paradise
Down where we can be free
We're gonna drink that wine
We're gonna jump for joy
In a town called Paradise

We're going up the mountainside
Child you can look for miles
And see the vision on the west
We're gonna swing round
And look from north to south
Swing round from east to west
And go round in a circle too
And we're gonna start dancing
Like we've never done before
I'm gonna take you in my arms
I'm gonna squeeze you tight
Everything will be alright
We're gonna get that squealin' feelin'
Gonna take you down to a town called Paradise,
Down where we can be free
It doesn't matter what they say
It doesn't matter what they do
All that matters is my relationship to you
By the river we will linger
As we drive down to be free
We're gonna ride all night long
All along the ancient highway
Gonna be there for the mornin' comes
