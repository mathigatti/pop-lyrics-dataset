Everybody got some soul
I don't care if they're young or old
Gotta hold on when all is gone
Make out like it's fine


While we say yeah (bad or good)
Oh yeah (bad or good)
Yeah (bad or good)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (bad or good)
That'll ever happen (bad or good)
Everybody (bad or good) sometimes
Oh, oh yeah

Don't even have to say one word
And it ain't nothin' that we've seen or heard
Get out, get out, jump and shout
They'd like to know what it's all about

Just say yeah (bad or good)
Oh yeah (bad or good)
And it's alright baby (bad or good)
It's gonna happen (bad or good)
Everybody (bad or good)
Sometimes (bad or good)
Some sweet time, ooo-ooo

(Instrumental)

If there's something baby
You want me to do
Come on over here and I'll see about you
Yeah I'll make ya shake it all about
Jump and shout

Just say yeah (bad or good)
Oh yeah (bad or good)
Wah ooo (bad or good, bad or good)
That'll happen, everybody (bad or good)
Sometime (bad or good)
FADES
At sometime (bad or good)
Oh yeah yeah (bad or good)
Oh yeah (bad or good)
