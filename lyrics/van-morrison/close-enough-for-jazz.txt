No use feeling sad
No use staying mad
Better when you're glad
You can be there in a heartbeat
When it's close enough for jazz
Close enough for jazz
Be glad with what you have
Even if it's half
Empty in the glass


If there's room to move your elbows
Then it's close enough for jazz
Close enough for jazz
When you're not in a hurry
When things may turn around
Never give in to worry
Try looking up not down, don't frown

Close enough for jazz
Is it persil is it daz?
Well it doesn't really matter
When it's better on the inside
And it's close enough for jazz
Close enough for jazz
Close enough for jazz
Close enough for jazz, oh yeah
