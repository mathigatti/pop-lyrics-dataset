We didn't know no better, and they said it could be worse
Some people thought it was blessing
Other people think that it's a curse
It's a choice between fact and fiction
And the whole world has gone astray
That's why there's no religion, no religion, no religion here today


And there's no straight answers
Of what this thing called love is all about
Some say it's unconditional
Other people just remain in doubt
Well I cleaned up my diction, I had nothing left to say
Except there's no religion, no religion, no religion here today

And they ask what hate is
It's just the other side of love
Some people want to give their enemies
Everything they think that they deserve
Some say why don't you love your neighbours
Go ahead, turn the other cheek
But there's nobody on this planet that can ever be so meek
And I can't bleed for you
You have to do it your own way
And there's no religion, no religion, no religion here today

And they ask what hate is
It's just the other side of love
Some people want to give their enemies
Everything they think that they deserve
Some say why don't you love your neighbours
Go ahead, turn the other cheek
But have you ever met anybody who's ever been the meek
And it's so cruel to expect the saviour to save the day
And there's no religion, no religion, no religion here today

And there's no mystery, and there's nothing hidden
And there's no religion here today

And there's no religion, no religion, no religion here today
