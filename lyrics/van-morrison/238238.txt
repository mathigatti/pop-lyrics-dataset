I wanna know did you get the feelin'?
Did you get it down in your soul?
I wanna know did you get the feelin'?
And did the feelin' grow?


Sometimes, when the spirit moves me
I can do many wondrous things
I wanna know when the spirit moves you
Did ye get healed?

I begin to realise
It manifest in my life
In oh, so many ways
Every day I wanna talk about it
And walk about it
Everyday I wanna be closer

I wanna know did you get the feelin'?
Did you get it down in your soul?
I wanna know did you get the feelin'?
Did ye get healed?

I begin to realise
Magic in my life
See it manifest in oh, so many ways
Every day is gettin' better and better
I wanna be daily walking close

It gets stronger when you get the feelin'
When you get it down in your soul
And it makes you feel good
And it makes you feel whole

When the spirit moves you
And it fills you through and through
Every morning and at the break of day
Did ye get healed?
