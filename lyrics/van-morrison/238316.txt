The sun is shining, it's everywhere
Don't have no worry, don't have no care
It must be true, this is the season
Baby it must be you


It was raining the other day
But that lonely feeling has gone away
It must be true, it's so pleasing
It must be you

That's what they say, in those old storybooks of old
You light my way and you satisfy my soul

It must be magic, it must be love
Oh what could I have been thinking of
It's the reason I'm feeling so blue
It must be you

Well that's what they say, in those old storybooks of old
You light my way and you satisfy my soul

It must be magic, it must be bliss
Oh it must be rain on a night like this
It must be true, that's the reason I think
It must be you

It must be you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, b-b-b-b-b-b-baby
It must be you
I really do believe, it must be you
Baby, baby, I really do believe, really do believe, really do believe.
