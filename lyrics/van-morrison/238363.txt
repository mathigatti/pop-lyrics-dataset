You're not supposed to be human
You're not supposed to really feel
Not supposed to get involved
With anything completely real
Fifteen families starving
All around the corner block
Here we're standing so alone
Just like Gibraltar Rock


Not supposed to break down
You're not supposed to break down
Swallow the dirt
Keep listening to the hurt
You'll be safe and sound

Supposed to be super human
Cover everything
Just like a bird
Cover an egg with it's wing
And knowing there's nothing sacred
And what is the use
&gt;No point trying to find
What is worth, what is true

Not supposed to break down
You're not supposed to break down
Swallow the hurt Listen to the dirt
You'll be safe and sound
You're not supposed to break down
You're not supposed to break down
Swallow the hurt
Listen to the dirt
And you'll be safe and sound

A fool and his mainline connection
By-pass going to the well
But that doesn't matter anymore
I'm sure that we can tell
Who's a puppet on a string
An' who really holds the glove
But it ain't up you and me
It's up to the Lord above

You're not supposed to break down
You're not supposed to break down
Swallow the hurt
Keep on listening to the dirt
And I'll bet you'll be safe and sound

You're not supposed to break down
You're not supposed to break down
Swallow the hurt
Listen to the dirt
I'll bet you'll be safe and sound
And I'll bet you'll be safe and sound
And I'll bet you'll be safe and sound
I'll bet you'll be safe and sound
