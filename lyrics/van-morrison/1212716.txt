You by the countryside
Oh you when you reach the sky
You and you're climbing up that hill
Well you when we're listening to the little whippoorwill


You when the sun goes down
You in the evening, in the morning when the sun comes round
You with your ballerina dance
Well you put me back in a trance

Well you take my breath away
Oh you even on a cloudy day
You make me holler when you come around
You make me holler when you shake 'em on down

That's entrainment, that's entrainment, that's entrainment, that's entrainment
That's entrainment, that's entrainment, that's entrainment

Well you take my breath away
Oh you even on a cloudy day
Well you on that old sea shore
Ah you when you're holding out your hand for more

Well you when you come around
Well you make me shake 'em on down
Well you in the morning, in the morning when the sun comes up
Well you in the evening when the sun goes down

You make me holler, make me holler when you come around
Oh want you to shake your money maker, want you to shake 'em on down
Shake your money maker, shake your money maker, shake 'em on down

That's entrainment, that's entrainment, that's entrainment
Called that's entrainment, that's entrainment, that's entrainment
That's entrainment, that's entrainment
That's entrainment, that's entrainment

Now you put me back in a trance
That's entrainment, that's entrainment, that's entrainment
That's entrainment, that's entrainment
