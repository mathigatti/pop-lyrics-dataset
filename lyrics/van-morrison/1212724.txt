Drinking wine in the alley, drinking wine in the alley
Making time, drinking that wine
Out of my mind in the days gone by


Making time with Sally, drinking that wine
In the days gone by, talking all out of my mind
Drinking that wine, talking all out of my mind

Spin and turning in the alley, spin and turning in the alley
Like a Whirling Dervish in the alley, drinking that wine
Drinking wine, making time in the days gone by

Boogie woogie child in the alley
Drinking that wine, making time, talking all out of my mind
Drinking wine in the days gone by, behind the ritual

Behind the ritual, behind the ritual
In the days gone by, drinking that wine
Making time, drinking that wine way back in time

Spin and turn and rhyme in the alley
Spin and turning, making up rhymes, talking all out of my mind
Talking that jive, drinking that wine in the days gone by

Drinking wine in the alley, drinking that wine
Making time, talking all out of my mind
Drinking that wine making time in the alley

Behind the ritual, behind the ritual
You find the spiritual, you find the spiritual
Behind the ritual in the days gone by

Drinking wine in the alley, drinking wine in the alley
Making time, talking all out of my mind
Drinking that wine in the days gone by, days gone by

Spin and turn talking that jive
Spin and turn talking that jive all out of our minds
Drinking that sweet wine
Making time, making time in the days gone by

Behind the ritual, behind the ritual
Behind the ritual, behind the ritual
Drinking that wine making time in the days gone by

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Behind the ritual, making time in the days gone by

In the days gone by, in the days gone by
Drink that wine, making time
Getting high in the days gone by, drinking that wine

Getting high behind the ritual
Getting high behind the ritual
Drinking that wine in the days gone by

Behind the ritual, behind the ritual
Behind the ritual, behind that spiritual
In the days gone by drinking that wine and getting high

So high behind the ritual, so high behind the ritual
So high in the days gone by
Drinking that wine making time, making time

Stretching time, stretching time
Drinking that wine, stretching time
Stretching time in the days gone by behind the ritual

Behind the ritual
