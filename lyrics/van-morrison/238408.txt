When I feel like l'can't get over
The solid white cliffs of Dover
When I don't know what to do
Baby see me through (yeah)


Well I've been too long in this storm
I feel so sad and forlorn
And perhaps I'm counting on you
See me through (yeah)

When I think of that dear rugged cross
Where the dear saviour gave his all
When I feel like I'm on my last go round
See me through

See me through the days of wine and roses
See me through one day at a time
See me through when things get heavy
On my mind

When I'm already gone (my cup is full)
You can get me through
Bright lights, big city won't do
You can see me through

When I wake up in the morning I'm gone
And I need a friend to lean upon
Why don't you see what you can do?
See me through

See me through the days of wine and roses
See me through one day, one day at a time
When I'm already mixed up and gone
And you know it's just not on
You know exactly what to do
Baby, see me through

Hey get down, baby please don't go
I love you so, you know what to do
Listen, when we were young
When I was a school boy, you used to love my tie
It ain't nothing like I love you now
Set my soul on fire yeah, I believe you

See me through, see me through
See me through before, before, before,
TV, before rock 'n' roll, previous, previous,
Previous, in the days...
