Well I'm higher than the world
And I'm livin' in my dreams
I'll make it better than it seems
Today


And I'm higher than a cloud
And I'm living in the sound
I'll make it better than it seems
Today

Higher than the world
But my head is in a swirl
I gotta give a life a whirl
Today

Higher than the clouds
Wrapped up in the sound
I'll make it better all around
Today

Higher than the world
But my head is in a swirl
I gotta give a life a whirl
Today

Higher in my mind
I'm going leave these blues behind
And I'll find what I find
Today

Cause I'm higher than the world
And I'm wrapped up in my dreams
I'll make it better than it seems
Today

Yes, I'm higher than the world
And I'm livin' in my mind
I got to hold on to what I find
Today

Just a little bit higher
Little bit higher
