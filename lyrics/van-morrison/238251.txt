Out on Highway 101.
Cruisin' easy,
And your favorite DJ
Havin' fun.
Look out, stand back,
There's a fool out on the road.
Look out,
Stand back,
There's a fool out on the road.
Had one too many drinks
And he just may overload.
Stand back.


Night time
Cruisin' 'long,
Cruisin' along.
Night time cruisin',
Night time cruisin' along.
You don't see the setting sun
[Even 'fore the mornin' come ??].
