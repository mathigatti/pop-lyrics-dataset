If I don't see you through the week
See you through the window
See you next time that we're talking on the telephone
And if I don't see you in that indian summer
Then I want to see you further on up the road
I said, oh won't you come back?
I have to see you my dear
Want you come back in the celtic new year?


In the celtic new year
If I don't see you when I'm going down louisiana
If I don't see you when I'm down on bourbon street
If you don't see me when I'm singing jack of diamonds
If you don't see me when I'm on my lucky streak
Woa, I want you, want you to come on back
I've made it very clear
I want you to come back home in the celtic new year
Celtic new year

If I don't see you when the bonfires are burning, burning
If I don't see you when we're singing the gloriana tune
If I've got to see you when it's raining deep inside the forest
I got to see you at the waning of the moon
Said oh, won't you come on back?
Want you to be of good cheer
Come back home on the celtic new year

Celtic new year, celtic new year
Celtic new year
In the celtic new year
In the celtic new year
Come on home, come on home
Come on home, come on home
In the celtic new year
