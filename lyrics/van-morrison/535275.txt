A-when your hands start a-clappin'
And your fingers start a-poppin'
When your feet wanna move around


And ya start to swing and sway
And the band begins to play
With a real cool way out sound

Then ya get the "can't help-it's"
And ya can't sit down
Feel like ya wanna move 'round an 'round

Need a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock n' roll on the side
Just for good measure

Need a pair of dancin' shoes
With your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure

Don't you worry about a thing
You start to dance and sing
And the chill bumps come up on you

Well, the beat'll finally get you
When the beat gets you, too and
Here's the thing for you to do

Hey, now, now, now

Need a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, just a little rock n' roll on the side
Just for good measure

Need a pair of dancin' shoes
With your lover by your side
Don't ya know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure

Don't ya worry about a thing
Ya start to dance and sing
Then the chill bumps come up on you

Well, the rhythm finally gets you
When the beat get you too, now
Here's the thing for you to do

Hey, now, now, now

Hey, now, now, now

Oh when, your hands start a clappin'
And your fingers start poppin'
When your feet wanna move around

Yeah, you start to swing and sway
And the band begins to play
With that real cool way out sound

Ya get the "can't help it's"
And ya can't sit down
Feel like ya wanna move 'round an 'round

Need a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock n' roll on the side
Just for good measure

Need a pair of dancin' shoes
With your lover by your side
Don't ya know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure

Don't you worry about a thing
Ya start to dance and sing
And the chill bumps come up on you

Oh, the rhythm finally get you
When the beat get you too, now
Here's the thing for you to do

Hey, now, now, now (get it)

Hey, now, now, now

Need a shot of rhythm and blues

Need a shot of rhythm and blues

Need a shot of rhythm and blues

Need a shot of rhythm and blues
(I need a shot)

Need a shot of rhythm and blues
(Oh Lord)

Need a shot of rhythm and blues
(Oooh)

Need a shot of rhythm and blues
(That's right)

Need a shot of rhythm and blues
