I gave my love a diamond, a ten cent stone
I gave her lonely teardrops and nights alone
I gave my love a promise that had no truth
What good is a promise without no truth?


I gave my love a fortune in silver and gold
I gave it to her lie, by lie, by lie, by lie that I had told
I gave my love a story that had no end
What good is a story that's got no end?
Tell me

I wrote her that we would marry
In about, a-one years time
I wrote her in a boxcar on the memphis line
I sent my love a letter without no stamp, ha
And what good is a letter without no stamp?

Good-bye baby
I'm feelin' so alone
I'm movin' on
I ain't got no small change
And don't call me, I'll call you

See ya!
