Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?


Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer, further, closer than a country mile

Why don't you spark me like you used to do?
And say sweet nothin's like you used to coo
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Well, why don't you just be like you used to be?
How come you find so many faults with me?
Somebody's changed so gimme a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer, further, closer than a country mile

Why don't you say the things you used to say?
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
