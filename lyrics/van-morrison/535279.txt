Oh don't you feel my leg, don't you feel my leg
'Cos if you feel my leg, you'll want to feel my thigh
Don't you feel my thigh, you'll wanna move up high
So don't you feel my leg


Don't you buy no rye, don't you buy no rye
'Cos if you buy me some rye, you gonna make me high
If you make me high, you'll wanna loosen my tie
Don't you buy no rye

Now you say you'll take me out, buy me gin and wine
You got something different on your mind
Say we're gonna have a lovely time
But what I got I know is mine

Don't you feel my leg, don't you feel my leg
'Cos if you feel my leg, you'll want to feel my thigh
If you feel my thigh, you're gonna get a surprise
Don't you feel my leg

Now you say you'll take me out buy me gin and wine
Honey, you got something on your mind
Say we're gonna have a lovely time
What I got I know is mine

Don't you feel my leg, don't you feel my leg
'Cos if you feel my leg, you'll wanna feel my thigh
If you feel my thigh, you'll want to move up high
You're gonna get a surprise
So, don't you feel my leg
So, don't you feel my leg
So, don't you feel my leg
