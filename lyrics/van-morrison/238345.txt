Memories
All I have is memories
All I have is memories
Memories of you


Now you're gone
They linger on, these memories
All these precious memories
Memories of you

How they linger in the twilight
In the morning in the small hours
Just before dawn

Memories
Of summer days so long ago
People in the places
That we used to know
Oh those memories

How they linger in the twilight
And in the wee small hours
Sometime just before the dawn

Oh those memories
Oh happy times those memories
All I have now is memories
Memories of you

Oh memories
All those precious memories
All I have is memories
Memories of you
