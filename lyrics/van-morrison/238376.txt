Ordinary people just don't comprehend
Ordinary people just don't seem to comprehend
The thing you feel they don't even know about
Cut yourself, that never did you no good
You cut yourself, that never did you no good
Nobody watching you, you gotta take care of yourself
Real thing....


When I came down your avenue
Blew you every
Blew you every which way
When I came down your avenue
Bloo hoo hoo you ever which way
Nobody watching you, you gotta take care of yourself

Ordinary people they just don't seem to comprehend
No they don't
Ordinary, everyday people just don't, just don't seem to comprehend
No they don't
Then you feel they don't, they don't, they don't even
Even, even know, even know about..
