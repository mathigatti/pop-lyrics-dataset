This is a song about your wavelength
And my wavelength, baby
You turn me on
When you get me on your wavelength
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
With your wavelength
Oh, with your wavelength
With your wavelength
With your wavelength
Oh mama, oh mama, oh mama, oh mama oh mama, oh mama


Wavelength
Wavelength
You never let me down'no
You never let me down'no

When I'm down you always comfort me
When I'm lonely you see about me
You are ev'ry where you're 'sposed to be
And I can get your station
When I need rejuvenation

Wavelength
Wavelength
You never let me down'no
You never let me down'no

I heard the voice of America
Callin' on my wavelength
Tellin' me to tune in on my radio
I heard the voice of America
Callin' on my wavelength
Singin' "Come back, baby
Come back
Come back, baby
Come back"

Do do do dou dit do do dou dit do do do do do
Do do do dou dit do do dou dit do do do do do

Won't you play that song again for me
About my lover, my lover in the grass, yeah, alright
You have told me 'bout my destiny
Singin' "Come back, baby
Come back
Come back, baby
Come back"

On my wavelength
Wavelength
You never let me down'no
You never let me down'no
When you get me on
When you get me on your wavelength
When you get me
Oh, yeah, Lord
You get me on your wavelength

You got yourself a boy
When you get me on
Get me on your wavelength
Ya radio, ya radio, ya radio
Ya radio, ya radio, ya radio
