Professional jealousy, can bring down a nation
And personal invasion, can ruin a man
Not even his family, will understand what's happening
The price that he's paying, or even the pain


Professional jealousy, started a rumour
And then it extended, to be more abuse
What started out as just, black propaganda
Was one day seen to be, believed as truth

They say the truth is, stranger than fiction
But a lie is more, deadly than sin
It can make a man very, bitter and angry
When he thinks that there's someone, is going to win

Professional jealousy makes other people crazy
When they think you've got something that, they don't have
What they don't understand is it's, just not easy
To cover it all, and, stand where you stand

Professional jealousy, makes no exception
It can happen to anyone, at any time
The only requirement is, knowing what's needed
And then delivering, what's needed on time

The only requirement is to, know what is needed
In doing the best you know how, deliver on time
The only requirement is, to know what is needed
Be best at delivering the, product on time.
