Wasted years been brainwashed by lies
Oh yes I have
Oh wasted years
I'm talking about wasted years
Oh I'm not seeing eye-to-eye
I just can't see the things I should see
Wasted years, baby
I was taking the wrong advice
I know you was, I know you was
And I was too
All alone I'm travelling
Travelling through these wasted years
For so long, so long, so long I was
Oh, I must have gained some wisdom
Down through the years I did
Somewhere along the way
Oh yes, I did, oh yes I did
Thet's why there can't be no more
No more
No more wasted years today
I got wise, I got wise to myself
Well baby the great sadness
Oh, you've got to let it all go
Oh yeah, oh yeah Van
Live in the present
Live in the future John Lee, ain't that so
Oh, it's a sad feeling, oh yeah
Oh, you've gotta find something
To carry you through, carry you through,
carry you through
I've learned my lesson
I ain't gonna do it no more, yeah
Now Van
Now John
I've learned my lesson
I should have a long time ago
That's right
All these wasted years, wasted years
I finally woke up and got wise
I ain't gonna be, ain't gonna be no fool no more
Now Van, now Van
Ain't gonna be nobody's body's fool no more
Sing the song Van, sing it with me
Well all alone, all alone I've been travelling
Yeah
Travelling all along through these wasted years
Dark, dark wasted years
So dark here
Dark, dark, dark, dark wasted years
I must have gained something
Yeah
Oh travelling along the lonely way
Yeah, I've learned a lesson
I'm gonna make damn sure baby, make damn sure
There's no more wasted years today
