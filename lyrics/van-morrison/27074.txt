I'll be your man
I'll understand
And do my best to take good care of you
Yes I will
You'll be my queen
I'll be your king
And I'll be your lover too
Derry down green
Colors my dream
A dream that's daily coming true
When day is through
I will come to you
And tell you of your many charms


You'll look at me
With eyes that see
And melt into each other arms
And so I come
To be the one
Who's always standing close to you

Reach out for me
So I can be
The one who's always reaching out for you
I'll be your king
You'll be my queen
And I'll be your lover too.
