The smile you smile is you
And I see through your laughing eyes
The smile you smile is you
And I see through your laughing eyes
And in the whirlpool of them
I can be in paradise


An I'd go roamin' in the gloamin'
And ever and a day with you
And I'd go roamin' in the gloamin'
And ever and a day with you
An' sit between the stars and say
Look, that's my point of view

I yi-yi, yi-yi, I love you
(I love you)
I yi-yi, yi-yi, I love you
(I love you)

And talk to trees and sunshine
Feel your lips against my lip
And talk to trees and sunshine
Feel your lips against my lip
And smell your sweet perfume
And even touch your fingertip

I yi-yi-yi, I love you
(I love you)

I yi-yi, I love, love you
(I love you)
