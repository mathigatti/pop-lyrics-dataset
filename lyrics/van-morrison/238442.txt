Showed me pictures in the gallery
Showed me novels on the shelf
Put my hands across the table
Gave me knowledge of myself.
Showed me visions, showed me nightmares
Gave me dreams that never end
Showed me light out of the tunnel
When there was darkness all around instead.


Tore down a la Rimbaud
And I wish my message would come
Tore down a la Rimbaud, you know it's hard some time
you know it's hard some time.

Showed me ways and means and motions
Showed me what it's like to be
Gave me days of deep devotions
Showed me things I cannot see.

Tore down a la Rimbaud
And I wish my purpose would come
Tore down a la Rimbaud, you know it's hard some time.
You know it's hard some time.

Showed me different shapes and colours
Showed me many different roads
Gave me very clear instructions
When I was in the dark night of the soul.

Tore down a la Rimbaud
And I wish my writing would come
Tore down a la Rimbaud, you know it's hard some time.
you know it's hard some time.
