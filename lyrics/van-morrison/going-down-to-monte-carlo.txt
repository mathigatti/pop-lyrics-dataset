Goin' down to monte carlo about 25k from nice
Goin' down to monte carlo about 25k from nice
Got to get myself together
Gotta get my head some peace
Sartre said that hell is other people
I believe that most of them are


Sartre said hell is other people
I believe that most of them are
Well their pettiness amazes me
Even after I've gone this far
Goin' down to monte carlo, 25k from nice
Goin' down to monte carlo 'bout 25k from nice

Gotta get my head together
Gotta get my head some peace
Playing in the background some
Kind of phony pseudo jazz
Playing in the background in the restaurant
Some kind of phony pseudo jazz

I don't care I'm trying to get away
From people, that are trying to drive me mad
After everything I've worked for
Not goin' to throw everything away
After everything I worked so hard for
I'm not goin' to give it all away

I just need to take a raincheck
I can't live to fight another day
Goin' down to monte carlo, 25k from nice
Goin' down, goin' down to monte carlo
Still about 25k from nice
Got to get my head showered
Got to find some release
