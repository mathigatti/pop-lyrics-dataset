I've been searching a long time
For someone exactly like you
I've been traveling all around the world
Waiting for you to come through
Someone like you 
Make it all worth while
Someone like you 
Keep me satisfied. 
Someone exactly like you 


I've been travellin' a hard road
Baby lookin' for someone exactly like you
I've been carryin' my heavy load
Waiting for the light to come shining through
Someone like you 
Make it all worth while
Someone like you 
Make me satisfied
Someone exactly like you 

I've been doin' some soul searching
To find out where you're at
I've been up and down the highway
In all kinds of foreign lands
Someone like you 
Make it all worth while
Someone like you 
Keep me satisfied 
Someone exactly like you

I've been all around the world
Marching to the beat of a different drum
But just lately I have realized
Baby the best is yet to come
Someone like you 
Make it all worth while
Someone like you 
Keep me satisfied 
Someone exactly like you
Someone exactly like you
Someone exactly like you

Best is yet to come
Ohhhhh the best is yet to come
Someone exactly like you
