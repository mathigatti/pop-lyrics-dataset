I'm back on th' corner
I'm right back on th' corner
I've been in this condition so many times before


Back by my lonesome
I'm right back by my lonesome
Just watching th' people going from door to door

I've got to change my ways
And try to quit this place
'Cause one of these rainy days
I'm gonna need a friendly face

I'm back on th' corner
I'm right back on th' corner
I've been in this condition so many times before

I've got to change my ways
And try to quit this place
'Cause one of these rainy days
I'm gonna be a mental case
