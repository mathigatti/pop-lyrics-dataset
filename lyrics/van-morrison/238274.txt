Dance on Gypsy Queen
If it's all night, it's alright
Rave on
Let your love come tumblin' down
If you let your love come tumblin' down
It's alright


Dance on (you know it's alright)
Gypsy Queen
Dance on (you know it's alright)
Gypsy Queen

Rave on
Right beneath the silver moon
Don't stop your carburetor
Let your car run
And if it starts to rain
Keep on dancin' in the rain
And if it's all night, it's alright

Dance on (you know it's alright)
Gypsy Queen
Dance on (you know it's alright)
Gypsy Queen

Ooo-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Ooo-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Come on, come on, come on
Let me hear you say

You're gonna dance on Gypsy Queen
Stars shine down on you
Yeah, ev'rything alright
Ooo-wee
I wanna throw my arms around you
I'm so glad I've found you Gypsy Queen

Dance on (you know it's alright)
Gypsy Queen
Dance on (you know it's alright)
Gypsy Queen

Ev'rything (dance on) is
(You know it's alright)
Ev'rything is (alright)

(Dance on) ev'rything is alright
(You know it's alright)

Keep on dancin'
(Dance on) all night
(You know it's alright) all night.
