I have finally come to realise
Child don't do what I have done
Cut my nose to spite my face
Made my own odds 10,000 to one


I saw the Empire slowly fade away
Tried to grasp it with my hand
Then I saw that it was not up to me
I'm just one tiny, tiny grain of sand

Oh, sweet release, oh how you soothe me
When I let go, I love how you use me

I have finally come to realise
It's something they're doing that they're doing that we find
A certain way that we can live our lives
And I'm takin' some peace of mind

Oh, sweet release, oh how you soothe me
And when I let go, and when I let go
I love how you use me
I have finally come to realise
It's something they're doing that they're doing that we find
A certain way that we can live our lives
And I'm takin' some peace of mind

I have finally come to realise, yes I have
Child don't do, child don't do what I have done
I cut my nose, I cut my nose to spite my face
I made my own odds 10,000 to one

I cut my nose to spite my face
I made my own odds 10,000 to one
One more time

I cut my nose, I cut my nose
I cut my nose to spite my face
I made my own odds 10,000 to one
