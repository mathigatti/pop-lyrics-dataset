Hey kids dig the first takes
Ain't that some inspiration
When sinatra sings against Nelson Riddle Strings
Then takes a vacation


Seen some hard times
Drawn some bad lines
No time for shoeshines
Hard Nose the Highway

I was tore down at the dead's place
Shaved head at the organ
But that wasn't half as bad as it was oh no
Belfast and Boston

Put your money where your mouth is
Then we can get something going
In order to win you must be prepared to lose sometime
And leave one or two cards showing
