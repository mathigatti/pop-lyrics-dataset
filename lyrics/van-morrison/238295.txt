Whoa sometime, sometimes I get a little worried
Well, but I wanna tell ya all, it's alright, yeah


'Cause I got a woman way across town
She's good to me, she's good to me 
I got a woman way 'cross town
She's alright, she's alright

She's my baby, don't ya understand?
'Cause you know I'm her lovin' man
I got a woman way 'cross town
She's good to me, yes she is

Save her lovin', kissin' and a huggin'
Just for me, yes she does
Save her lovin', early in the mornin'
Just for me, whoa yeah

She's my baby
Don't ya understand?
Well ya know I'm her lovin' man
Well I got a woman, right here in town
She's alright, ready

Hey!

(Instrumental)

She's there to love me
Both day and night
She never grumbles or fusses
Always treats me right

Never on the streets
Leavin' me alone
She knows a woman's place
Right back there in her home

Got a woman way across town
She loves me
She's my lady

I got a woman, way across town
She good to me, she good to me
She's my baby
Don't ya understand?
Lord, ya know I'm her lovin' man
Got a little woman, way across town
She alright, she alright

Hey hey, oh yeah

Hey, oh yeah

Cryin' whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa 
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
She's alright
Yes she is
She's alright

You're alright
You're alright, you're alright
You're alright, you're alright
You're alright
FADES
An alright, an alright
An alright, I got a woman...
