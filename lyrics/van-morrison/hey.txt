Listen Mr. DJ
Won't you play me something slow
Play me the songs
For the lonely ones
Play me something
That I know
Hey Mr. DJ


I'm in a sad mood tonight
Play me something just for me and my baby
Won't you make everything alright
I'm gonna turn it way down low
Leave it on all night long
Till the morning comes
Like my lover my friend until the end
And that special someone

Hey Mr. DJ
Play me Rainbow 66
'Cos I'm drifting like a ship out on the fog
And I just don't know what's coming next
Gonna turn it way down low
Leave it on all night long
Until the morning comes
For my lover my friend until the end

And that special someone
Hey Mr. DJ
Play me Rainbow 66
'Cos I'm drifting like a ship out on the sea
And I just don't know what's coming next

Well, Mr. DJ
I'm in a sad mood tonight
Play me something for me and my darling
Want you to make everything
Alright
La, ta. ta, ta, tata...
