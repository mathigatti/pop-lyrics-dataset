Really don't know, really don't know
Just what's wrong
Feel like I don't belong
And I just can't get together
Today, anyway
Keep on rainin', more and more


Everyday
Yeah, in a wider sense
Yeah, in a wider sense
Keep on rainin'
Keep on rainin'
Everyday
Look to the sky, but the sky may fall
See thru' my eye, but my eye don't see at all

Keep on rainin'
Look to the sky, but the sky may fall
See thru' my eye, but my eye don't see at all
Keep on rainin', more and more
Everyday
Yeah, in a wider sense
Yeah, in a wider sense
Yeah, in the system
Every, every, every, every day
