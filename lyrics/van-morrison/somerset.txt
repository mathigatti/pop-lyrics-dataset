We met, deep down in somerset
A time I can't forget
When we were sippin' cider in the shade
Oh the sun was setting in the west
You looked your very best that night
Stars were shining in your eyes


And we walked, walked all along the sand
And it felt, felt like a wonderland
And when the summer breeze was gone
The memory lingered on
You and me down in somerset

Oh we walked, walked and walked and walked all along the sand
And it felt just like our love just began
And when the summer breeze was gone
The memory lingered on, me and you
When the summer set
We met, we met, we met deep down in somerset
A time I can't forget
You were sippin' cider in the shade
