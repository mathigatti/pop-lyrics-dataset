You didn't know I wasn't free when you fell in love with me
And with all your young heart you learned to care
It brought you shame and disgrace
The world has tumbled in your face
Because they call our love a back street affair


They say you wrecked my home
I'm a husband that's gone wrong
They don't know the sorrow that we had to bear
While the one I was tied to was the first to be untrue
How can they call our love a back street affair
Well we have each other now
That's all that matters anyhow
While the judgement of gossips never fair

We'll just be brave and strong
Then someday they'll see they're wrong
So let them call our love a back street affair
We'll be free to love someday
When all the talk has died away
And the happiness we hoped for then we'll share
And I'll climb a mountain high and the world will hear me cry
That our love is not a back street affair
