We were the War Children
Born 1945
When all the soldiers came marching home
Love looks in their eye


Tennessee Tennessee Williams
Let your inspiration flow
Let it be around when we hear the sound
When the spring time rivers flow when the rivers flow

Rod Steiger and Marlon Brando
Standing with their heads bowed on the side
Crying like a baby thinking about the time
James Dean took that fatal ride, took that ride

Tennessee Tennessee Tennessee Tennessee Williams
Let your inspiration go
Will you be around to hear the sound
When the spring time rivers flow, rivers flow

And Steiger and Marlon Brando
Standing with their heads bowed on the side
Crying like a baby thinking about the time
James Dean took that fatal ride, took that ride

And we were the Wild Children
Back in 1945
When all the soldiers came marching home
Love looks in their eyes, in their eyes
