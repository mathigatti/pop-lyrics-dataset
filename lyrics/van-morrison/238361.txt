And she moves on the solid ground
And she shines light all around
And she moves on the solid ground
In the County Down


And she moves on the solid earth
And she knows what her wisdom is worth
And she moves on the solid ground
In the County Down

She lifts me up
Fill my cup
When I'm tired and weary, Lord
And she keeps the flame
And she give me hope
[To] carry on

If you see her
Say, "Hello"
Well she's someone that I surely know
When I was young she made me roam from my home
In the County Down

She lifts me up
She fill my cup
When I'm tired and weary, Lord
And she keeps the flame
And she give me hope
[To] carry on

If you see her
Say, "Hello"
Well she's someone that I'd surely know
When I was young she made me run from my home
In the County Down

And she moves on the solid ground
And she moves in the County Down
In the County Down
When she moves.
