Well, I wake up
And I'm slowly
A-comin' down.
I'm just tryin'
To get my feet back
On the ground.
I got more
Of an ideaJust exactly
What I'm worth.
Baby, baby, I wake up
And I'm comin'
Down to earth.
Yeah, baby, baby, I wake up
And I'm comin'
Down to earth.
Was I
Ever wrong
About so much?
That's all you get,
Get completely
Out of touch.
And it's a very, very, very, very painful thing
When you witness your
Death and your birth.
Baby, baby, baby, I wake up,
I wake up
And I'm comin'
Down to earth.
Yeah,
Baby, baby, baby, I wake up
And I'm comin'
Down to earth,
Yeah.


Back here,
Back here
On the planet,
A-been a long, long, long fall,
But that's
Always just a problem
When you think you know it all.
And it's a very, very, very, very, very painful thing
When you witness your own
Death and your birth.
Baby, baby, I wake up, I wake up
And I'm comin'
Down to earth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I wake up
And I'm comin'
Down to earth.
Yeah,

Yeah, I wake up
And I'm comin',
babe, I wake up, I wake up.
Ow!, woke up this mornin',
I walked out, walked out the door,
Got in my car and I drove
Down the road,

And I woke up,
Yeah, yeah, yeah I,
Babe, I wake up,
