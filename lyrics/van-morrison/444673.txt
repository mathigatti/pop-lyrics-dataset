When you got a headache
An you try to soothe the pain
Go right back to sleep
And you'll feel all right again


When ya got a backache
Little rubbin' will see you through
When you got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do

There ain't nothin' you can do
There ain't nothin' you can do

When you got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do

A man can't break a stone
So he tried another lick
Iceman can't break his ice, Lord
So he tries another pick

An electric lights go out
Candle light will see you through
When you got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do

There ain't nothin' you can do
There ain't nothin' you can do
When you got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do
Hey!
