From my retreat and view
Make my own break through
And I might see things new
From my retreat and view
There's visions to behold
Treasures to unfold
Home away from home
From my retreat and view


Well the higher you go
The more that you know you can find
Like a memory that's there
Stuck in the back of your mind
There's bargains of the soul
Dreams that do unfold
Now I know it's true
From my retreat and view
There's bargains of the soul

Treasures to behold
Some time to start anew
From my retreat and view
From my retreat and view
Got to make my own break through
So I can see things new
From my retreat and view
High up on the mountainside
From my retreat and view

The place to satisfy
From my retreat and view
From my retreat and view
Got to make my own break through
So I can see things new
From my retreat and view
