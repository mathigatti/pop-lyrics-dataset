I'm standing by my window
And I'm waiting on the summer rain
And I'm standing by my window
And I'm waiting on the summer rain
Well, I felt this way before and
I'm gonna feel this way again


I've been listening to this music
Ever since the age of three
I've been listening to this music
Ever since the age of three
I want you to play me a "T" for Texas
Or play me a "T" for Tennessee

I want a plain glass of water
Vanilla ice cream with a cherry on top, that's what I want
I want a plain glass of water
Uh, huh, vanilla ice cream with a cherry on top, mm, hm, hm, hm,
Take a walk with me, baby
Up the foggy mountain top, watch it!

I'm going up on highway one
Said you know I dig it the most
I'm going up on highway one
Eh, you know I dig it the most
I'm gonna sing this song
All along the water coast

I want a plain glass of water
Ice cream with a cherry on top, that's the way I like it, ah!
I want a plain glass of water,
Vanilla ice cream with a cherry on top
Walk with me, baby
Up the foggy mountain top, what's that?
Oh, come along with me, oh!
On the foggy mountain top
Keep on walking, keep on walking, baby
On the foggy mountain top
Keep walking with me baby
Up the foggy mountain top
