You gotta fight every day to keep mediocrity at bay
Gotta fight every day to keep mediocrity at bay
Got to fight with all your might
Not to get in the bleeding heart's way
You gotta fight for your rights
You can't bury your head in the sand
You gotta fight for your rights
You can't just bury your head in the sand


Politics and religion
Superstition go hand in hand
Well you're going through the motions
And they can't hear a word you say
Well you're going through the motions
They don't want to hear a word you say

Got to keep boredom at bay
And keep mediocrity away
Gotta fight every day
To keep mediocrity at bay
Gotta fight every day
To keep mediocrity at bay

Got to fight with all your might
Not to get in the bleeding heart's way
Got to fight with all your might
Not to get in the bleeding heart's way
