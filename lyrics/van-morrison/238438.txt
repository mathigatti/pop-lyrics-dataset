This weight is weighing on my heart
This weight is tearing us apart
This weight is weighing on my soul
And it just won't leave me alone


You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

In the neighboorhood people watching me
Got to move to protect my sanity
Anonymity is all I want you see
You may think it's mediocrity, but

You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking ahout this weight

And this Hollywood ain't no good
I would rather be like Robin Hood
If I could only loose this...

You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

And this Hollywood ain't no good
I would rather be like Robin Hood
If I could only loose this...

You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

In the very first it was rock and roll
Set me free in body and soul
But this weight is just bringing me down
It's never satisfied every time I go to town
You know I'm talking about this weight....
