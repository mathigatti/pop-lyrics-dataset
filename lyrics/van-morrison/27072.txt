Whenever god shines his light on me
Open up my eyes,so I can see
When I look up in the darkest night
Then I know everything is gonna be alright
In deep confusion,in great despair
When I reach out for him,he is there
When I am lonely as I can be
Then i know that god shines his light on me
Reach out for him,he'll be there
With him your troubles,you can share
If you live the life you love
You get the blessing from above
Heals the sick and heals the lame
Says you can too in jesus' name
And he lifts you up,and he turns you around
And he puts your feet back on higher grounds...etc...
