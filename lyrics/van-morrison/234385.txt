You say the world is mad
You say that you've been had
You don't like your part in the floor show
You say it's all a bust
There's no one you can trust
Well, tell me something that I don't know


You say the world's a mess
It's anybody's guess
As to who will deliver that low blow
You suffer from the strain
You don't dig pain
Well, tell me something that I don't know

You say there's some mistake
You didn't get your break
You don't see the magic in the moonglow
You're on a one way street
Your life is incomplete
Well, tell me something that I don't know

You're uptight
It ain't right
Well, tell me something that I don't know
