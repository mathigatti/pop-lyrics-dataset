We strolled through fields all wet with rain
And back along the lane again
There in the sunshine
In the sweet summertime
The way that young lovers do 


I kissed you on the lips once more
And we said goodbye at your front door
In the night-time
Yeah, that's the right time
To feel the way that young lovers do 

Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that we were
and the way that we wanted to be
Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that I was for you
and you were for me
And then we danced the night away
And turning to each other, say, 'I love you, I love you'
The way that young lovers do 

Do, do, do, do... 

Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that we were and the way
that we wanted to be
Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that I was for you
and you were for me
Ah, we long to dance the night away
And turning to each other, say, 'I love you. Baby, I love you'
The way that young lovers do, lovers do, lovers do 

Do, do, do, do....
