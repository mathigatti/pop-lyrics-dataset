Let the midnight special
Let the midnight special
Shine its light on me
Shine a light on me,
Let the midnight special
Let the midnight...
Shine its ever-loving light on me
Ever loving light on me. 


Yonder come miss Rosey,
How in the world do you know,
How in the world do you know ?
Well, I know her by her apron
And the dress she wore.
Umbrella on her shoulder,
A piece of paper in her hand,
She gonna tell old John
She want back her man,
She want back her man. 

Let the midnight special
Let the midnight special
Shine its light on me
Shine a light on me.
Let the midnight special
Let the midnight...
Shine its ever-loving light on me
Ever loving light on... 

If you ever go to Houston,
Yeah, you better walk right,
You'd better not gamble
And sure thing better not fight.
The next thing you know
The sheriff gonna arrest you
And some judge send you down
And you can bet your bottom dollar
Lord, you'll be chaingang bound,
Chaingang bound. 

Let the midnight special
Let the midnight
Shine its light on me
Shine, shine, shine, shine,
Let the midnight special
Shine on,
Shine its ever-loving light on me
Shine on me, yeah. 

Let the midnight special
Shine, shine, shine,
Shine its light on me
Shine, shine on me,
Let the midnight special
Way into midnight,
Shine its ever-loving light on me
Way into midnight, baby,
Let the midnight special
Waah...
