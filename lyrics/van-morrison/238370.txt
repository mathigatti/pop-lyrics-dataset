It's been so long
Since I seen ya smilin'
Made me think about, when you were a child
It won't be long, I'm comin' home
Gonna get you in my arms
And make love, to you darlin'
One more time


When I left, you didn't even say goodbye
The tears kept rollin' from my eyes
It won't be long, I'm comin' on home
Gonna get you in my arms and make love
To you darlin' just one more time, umm

(Instrumental)

Yes, it won't be long
I'm comin' on home
Gonna get you in my arms
And make love to you you darlin'
Just one more time

Spoken:
Well they say, in this here world
There's a girl for every boy
You're the one, you're the one
Who's brought me so much joy

It won't be long
I'm comin' on home
Gonna get you in my arms
I'll make love to you darlin'
Just one more time, yeah
One more time
One more time
Just one more time
