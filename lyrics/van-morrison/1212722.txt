People come and people go
One monkey don't stop no show
I'm getting too tired to start all over again
Cos it ain't gonna change no thing


There's just all of this here land
Been trampled on by man
And all around me, all these birds of prey
And all I'm trying to do is just get by one more day

Only a fool would ever think things could ever be the same
Only a fool would surmise everyone is sane

I watch them come and go
I'm fed up with the status quo
And I'm feeling too tired to start all over again
Cos I know that it ain't gonna change no thing

Only a fool could think that things would ever be simple again
Only a fool would surmise everyone is the same

So I watch them come and go
I don't have time for the status quo
I say blessed be and I'm on my way, on my way
Cos it ain't gonna change no thing, no, no, no, no, no, no

Well it ain't gonna change no thing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well it ain't gonna change no thing
