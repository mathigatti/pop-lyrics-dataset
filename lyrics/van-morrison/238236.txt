In the daring night when all the
Stars are shining bright
Squeeze me don't leave me
In the daring night
Galactic swirl in the firmament tonight
Oh with the Lord of the Dance
With the Lord of the Dance
In the daring night


I see Orion and The Hunters
Standing by the light of the moon
In the daring night
In the daring night
And the heart and the soul
As we look up in awe and wonder at the heavens
Oh and we go with the Lord of the Dance
With the Lord of the Dance, the Lord of the Dance
In the daring night

In the daring night when all the stars are
Shining bright
Oh baby squeeze me don't leave me in the daring night
In the firmament we move, we move and we live
And we have our being
Squeeze me don't leave, leave me in the daring night

In the firmament we move and galactic swirl
And we live and we breathe and have our being
Baby in the daring light
Darling squeeze me squeeze me
Don't ever leave me in the daring night
When all the stars are shining bright
And don't let go, and don't let go
Don't let go don't let go in the daring night
And we move and we move, and we move and we move
Baby don't let go in the daring night

In the daring night when all the stars are
Shining bright
Baby squeeze me don't leave me in the daring night
Capture it all oh with the Lord of the Dance
Oh with the Lord of the Dance in the daring night
With the Lord of the Dance in the daring night
With the lord of the dance and the great Goddess
Of the eternal wisdom
Standing by the light of the moon in the daring night

And the bodies move and we sweat
And have our being
Don't leave me in the daring night
In the daring night when all the stars are
Shining bright
Squeeze me don't leave me
Baby in the daring night
Squeeze me don't leave me etc.
