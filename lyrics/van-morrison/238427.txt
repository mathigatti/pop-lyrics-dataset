Symphony Sid is grooving
Man this whole house is moving
Symphony Sid is grooving
Symphony Sid


Symphony Sid is swinging
That radio is ringing
Symphony Sid is swinging
Symphony Sid

Bing-bang bing-bang bing-bang ...
Bing-bing-bing-bang ...

Symphony Sid is jumping
Man this whole house is romping
Symphony Sid is jumping
Symphony Sid

Tune in and listen
Check out what you're missin'
You're finally close to eighty
On the dot
Some say he's the greatest
One thing is assured
When you're the latest
You're gonna be hoppin' and boppin' round the future
All your friends will be knockin' on your door
When Sidney plays his swingin' music, catch it you should take up the
season you feel the temperature risin'
Yeah man the radio is hot, you'd never want to stop
Spinning like a little red top, all over town
Now, sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers dig in
Watch this, put 'em down

Bing-bang bing-bang bing-bang ...
Bing-bing-bing-bang ...

Symphony Sid is jumping
Man this whole house is romping
Symphony Sid is jumping
Symphony Sid
