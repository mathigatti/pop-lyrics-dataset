Sunset glow from a hill
Let it flow take your fill
Such a perfect moment
Mona Lisa smile
One such perfect moment
Makes it all worthwhile


Autumn night crystal clear
Mystic night seems so near
Such a perfect moment
Nothin' you can say
One such perfect moment
Gets you through the day

Mountain sheen, ocean shine
Miocene valentine
One such perfect moment
Never twice th' same
Such a perfect moment
Will keep you in th' game
