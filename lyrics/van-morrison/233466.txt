There's a voice cryin' out in the wilderness
All your trails have not been in vain
And you're doin' the best you know how to do
Gaining strength in the things that remain


You're part of the plan
For a new kind of man to come through

There's an angel that's watching right over you
All your trials have not been in vain
Won't you lift your head up to the starry night
Finding strength in the things that remain

You're part of the plan
For a new kind of man to come through

When a man comes through
He must do what he's supposed to do
When a man comes through.
He can't do what everyone expects him

Won't you lift your head up to the mountain top
All your trials have not been in vain
There's a light that keeps shining up ahead of you
Every step of the way that you take

It's part of the plan
For a new kind of man to come through
