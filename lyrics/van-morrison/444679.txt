We've got to put our heads together
I'm sure that we can work it out
I'm weighin' up the situation
And checkin' it out
Takin' it further
Takin' it further
Checkin' it out 
This is a workin' situation
I'm tellin' you without a doubt
We've gotta pull it all in tight, baby
Checkin' it out
Takin' it further
Takin' it further
Checkin' it out 


And all the obstacles along the way 
Sometimes may feel so tremendous 
There are guides and spirits all along the way
Who will befriend us 

Let's talk it out across the table
Make sure that we leave nothin' out
Get into it like a meditation
Start checkin' it out
Takin' it further
Takin' it further
Checkin' it out 

And all the obstacles along the way 
Sometimes may feel so tremendous 
There are guides and spirits all along the way
Who will befriend us 

Let's talk it out across the table
Make sure that we leave nothin' out
Get into it like a meditation
Start checkin' it out
Takin' it further
Takin' it further
Checkin' it out 

Checkin' it out, now baby
Checkin' it out checkin' it out
You meditate, you meditate
You meditate
And you come back
You come back
