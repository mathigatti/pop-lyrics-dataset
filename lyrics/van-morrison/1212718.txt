The sound of the evening breeze
Is calling you back to me
The sun behind the clouds
Reminds me that you're not around
Lover come back to my arms
Lover come back to my heart


The sound of the roar of the waves
The misty evening haze
Playing that sad refrain
Going through it all over again
Lover come back to my arms
Lover come back to my heart

Since you went away
I'm a lonely, lonely, lonely one
Come on back to stay
You are the only one

The clickety clack of the train
Is easing all of my pain
I'm seeing it all too plain
I'm calling you home again
Lover come back to my heart
Lover come back to my arms

Since you went away
Oh Lord I'm a lonely one
Come on back to stay
You be my only one

The clickety clack of the train
Is making it all so plain
Is easing some of my pain
And I'm calling you home again
Lover come back to my arms
Lover come back to my heart

Lover come back to my arms
Lover come, come on back baby
Come on back to my heart
Come on back, come on back baby
Come on back, come on backâ€¦

Lover come back to my arms
Lover come back to my heart
