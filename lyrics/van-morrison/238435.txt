I dreamed you paid your dues in Canada
Left me to come through
I headed for the right way
I knew exactly just what to do
I dreamed we played cards in the dark
And you lost and you lied
Wasn't very hard to do
But hurt me deep down inside


Chorus:
Mmmm, these dreams of you
So real and so true
These dreams of you
So real and so true

My back was up against the wall
And you slowly just walked away
You never really heard my call
When I cried out that way
With my face against the sun
You pointed out for me to go
Then you said I was the one
Had to reap what you did sow

[Chorus]

Bridge:
And hush-a-bye, don't ever think about it
Go to sleep don't ever say one word
Close your eyes, you are an angel sent down from above

And Ray Charles was shot down
But he got up to do his best
A crowd of people gathered round
To the question answered "yes"
And you slapped me on the face
I turned around the other cheek
You couldn't really stand the pace
And I would never be so meek

[Chorus]
