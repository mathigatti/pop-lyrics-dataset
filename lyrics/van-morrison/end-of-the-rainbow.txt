No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
No social ladder to climb around here
No panhandlers going to stake any claim here
Goldmine is not what it's worth, know the score
No carpetbaggers, come in and take it
That just doesn't exist anymore
Rugs and the furniture just can't be lifted
Everything now has got to be nailed to the floor


So much for capitalism, so much for materialism
Every penny now has got to be earned
Everyone has got to be here at the coalface
Taking coals to newcastle, you're going to get burned
No gravy train that stops at your station
Every penny has got to be earned
Everyone now has got to be at the coalface

Try taking coals to newcastle, you're going to get burned
No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
No social ladder to climb anymore
No panhandler can stake a claim here
Goldmine is not what it's worth, know the score
No carpetbaggers, come in and take it
It's not there for the taking no more

Rugs and the furniture cannot be lifted
Everything has got to be nailed to the floor
No pot of gold, end of the rainbow
No pot of gold, end of the rainbow no more
End of the rainbow no more
No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow

No social ladder to climb anymore
No pot of gold, end of the rainbow
No social ladder to climb
Know the score
Know the score
