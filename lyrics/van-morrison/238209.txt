And I take you down to the burning ground
And you change me up and you turned it around
In the wind and rain I'm gonna see you again
In the morning sun and when the day is done
And you take my hand and you walk with me
Sometimes it feels like eternity
And I turn the tide I get back my pride
And I make you proud won't you say it out loud
When I take you down to the burning ground
To the burning ground, to the burning ground
To the burning ground, to the burning ground


And I take you down by the factory
And I show you like it has to be
And you understand how the work is done
And I pick up the sack in the midday sun
And I pull you through by the skin of your teeth
And I lift the veil, I see what's underneath
And you return to me and you sit on your throne
And you make me feel that I'm not alone

And I take you down to the burning ground
To the burning ground, to the burning ground
To the burning ground
Hey man, what's that you're carrying?
Feels like lead
It weighs a ton - let's see if we can dump it by the side of the hill
Hey wait up, why don't you dump it on the burning ground
Dump it down there
Yeh man, dump the Jute
Hey man dump the Jute on the burning ground
Dump the Jute?
Yeh you know, dump the Jute
Dump the Jute!

On the burning ground
On the burning ground
And you make me think what it's all about
Sometimes I know gonna work it out
And I watch you run in the crimson sun
Tear my shirt apart open up my heart
And I watch you run
Down on your bended knees
By the burnt out well
Can you tell me please
Between heaven and hell
Won't you take me down

To the burning ground, to the burning ground
To the burning ground, to the burning ground

And you fall and pray, when you hear that sound
As we're walking back to the burial mound
And you shake your head and you turn it around
And you see the flames from the burning ground
And you get down on your knees and pray
And I catch my breath as we're running away
And I take the Jute and I throw him down

On the burning ground, on the burning ground
On the burning ground, it's on the burning ground.
