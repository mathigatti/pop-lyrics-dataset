And when heart is open
And when heart is open
You will change just like a flower slowly openin'
And when heart is open
You will change just like a flower slowly openin'
When there's no comin'
And there's no goin'
And when heart is open
You will meet your lover
You will tarry
You will tarry
With your lover?
And when heart is open
You will meet your lover
When there's no comin'
And there's no goin'
Oh, hand me down my old great coat
Oh, hand me down my old great coat
I believe I'll go walkin' in the woods
Oh. my darlin'.
Oh, hand me down my big boots.
Oh, hand me down my big boots
I believe I'll go walkin' in the woods
Oh, my darlin'
And she moves by the waterfall
When she moves
She moves just like a deer
Across the meadow
And when heart is open
You will change just like a flower slowly openin'
When there's no comin'
And there's no goin '
You will tarry
With your lover
When heart is open
You will meet your lover
Oh, hand me down my great coat
Oh, hand me down my great coat
I believe I'll go walkin' in the woods
Oh, my darlin'.
Oh, hand me down my big boots
Oh, hand me down my big boots.
I believe I'll go walkin' in the woods
Oh, my darlin'.
Oh, when she moves,
She moves like a deer across the meadow.
When heart is open
You will change just like a flower slowly openin'
You will change just like a flower slowly openin'
You will change just like a flower slowly openin'
When there's no comin'
When there's no comin'
And there's no goin'
You will meet
You will meet your lover
When there's no comin'
And there's no goin'
You will meet
You will meet your lover
