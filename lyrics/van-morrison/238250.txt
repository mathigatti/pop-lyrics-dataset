Well you've been on a fast train and it's going off the rails
And you can't come back can't come back together again
And you start breaking down
In the pouring rain
Well you've been on a fast train


When your lover has gone away don't it make you feet so sad
And you go on a journey way into the land
And you start breaking down
'Cos you're under the strain
And you jump on a fast train

You had to go on the lam you stepped into no-man's land
Ain't nobody here on your waveband
Ain't nobody gonna give you a helping hand
And you start breaking down
And just go into the sound
When you hear that fast train

And you keep moving on to the sound of the wheels
And deep inside your heart you really know oh, just how it feels
And you start breaking down and go into the pain
Keep on moving on a fast train

You're way over the line next thing you're out of your mind
And you're out of your depth in through the window she crept
Oh there's nowhere to go in the sleet and the snow
Just keep on moving on a fast train

You had to go on the lam stepping in no-man's land
Ain't nobody here on your waveband
Nobody even gonna lend you a helping hand
Oh and you're so alone can you really make it on your own
Keep on moving on a fast train

Oh going nowhere, except on a fast train
Oh trying to get away from the past
Oh keep on moving keep on moving on a fast train
Going nowhere, across the desert sand, through the barren waste
On a fast train going nowhere
On a fast train going nowhere
