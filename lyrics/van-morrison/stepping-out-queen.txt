It seems like it must have been something that I said
Something that somebody must have done
This is a song
It's got a whole lot of soul
When I seen you by the way before
In New York City


I think it was on Eighth Street, right?
Or was it in San Francisco, whatever
Always put the first one first
And the second one, second
Come in the garden and look at the flowers
That's what you were saying, right?
Come in my garden and look at the flowers

We can Just sit and talk for hours and hours
Come in my garden, come in my garden
Come in my garden
Come in my, come in my, come in my garden
Come in my, come in my, come in my garden
Come in my garden, come in my garden
Look at the flowers, we can just sit and talk
And feel

As the sun come over the valley
As the sun come over the valley
I believe
I like the way
I like your face from the left side
As you go
As you go stepping out queen
Stepping out queen

It's just a windfall away, it's just a windfall away
It's a windfall away
As you, as you, as you, as you go, as you go
Stepping out queen
Let me see you step out
Come on!
As you go steppin' out queen

You can promenade
You can promenade
When you step
With a little bit of hip action
You go steppin' out queen
just a little bit of hip for the trip
As you go
Steppin' out queen

I said give me a little bit of shoulder slide
Come on
Da, dada, do dodo, do dodo, do dodo, do doooo
Come on baby I just wanna reach out
I wanna reach out and touch you
I don't wanna talk
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do..
