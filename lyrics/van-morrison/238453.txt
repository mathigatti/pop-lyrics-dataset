Let us free you from the pain
Let us see you smile again
Let us unlock all the chains
You're broken-hearted


Let us help you to forget
Let us help you unlock it
It's not nearly time to quit
You've only started

You gotta
Sit down funny face
Oh, let your laughter fill the room
Um-mm

Light up your golden smile
Take away (ooo) all your misery and gloom
Oh, let your laughter fill the room
Oh, let your laughter fill the room

Let us shake you by the hand
Let us help you understand
Take your head out of the sand
And shake it free now

Let us help you to go on
We are here to lean upon
Now you know exactly just who
You want to be now

Come on
Sit down funny face
Oh. let your laughter (yeah)
Let your laughter fill the room

Light up your golden smile
Take away all your misery and gloom
Oh, let your laughter fill the room
Oh, let your laughter fill the room

[Instrumental, mandolin &amp; bass clarinet]

Let us lift you up on high
See the twinkle in your eye
Raise you up into the sky
And say it's easy

Hey let the trumpets ring it
Oh, let the angels sing it
Let your pretty feet go dancing
Let your worn out mind go prancing

And sit down, oh funny face
Oh, let your laughter fill the room

Light up your golden smile
Take away all your misery and gloom
Oh, let your laughter fill the room, come on
Let your laughter fill the room

Let your laughter fill the room
Let your laughter fill the room
Let it fill the room

[Fades]
Ooh, let it fill the room
Ooh, let the laughter fill the room, ooh.
