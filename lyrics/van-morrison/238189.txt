Tell me what do you get
At the end of the day
Is it all worth the while
Can you put on a smile
Does it fill you with pride
All the feelings inside
Or do you just wanna hide
Can you still walk away
At the end of the day


At the end of the day
Are you lonely or sad
Do you think you've been had
Is your heart ever glad
Or are you afraid
'Cause you don't have it made
That you don't make the grade
Or of what people say
At the end of the day

[Instrumental solo]

At the end of the day
Is your framework intact
When you clean up your act
Do they keep coming back
Do you say follow that
Pat yourself on the back
Do you get what you lack
Do they give you respect
Or is it after the fact
At the end of the day

Tell me what do you get
Is it heartachce and pain
Does it keep coming back
Everytime that it rains
When I see you again
Will it still be the same
Am I really to blame
'Cause I don't play the game
At the end of the day

At the end of the day
At the end of the day
At the end of the day
At the end of the day
Got to kneel down and pray
At the end of the day
Got to kneel down and pray
At the end of the day
