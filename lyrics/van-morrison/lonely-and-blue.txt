Old empty bed, springs hard as lead
Something I said made you see red
What did I do to feel so lonely and blue?
Even the mouse, up and ran from the house
Laughed at me so scornfully
What did I do to feel this lonely and blue?
I cried and I sighed


But that don't help my game, no, no, no, no
I tried to hide
But things don't seem the same, oh
How will it end? I ain't got no friend
My only sin is in your grin
Oh what did I do to feel this lonely and blue?

I cried and I sighed
But that don't, don't help my game
I tried to hide
Things don't seem the same, oh
How will it end? Ain't got no friend
My only sin was in your grin
Oh what did I do to feel so lonely and blue?
Oh yeah
