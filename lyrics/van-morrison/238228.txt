Could you, a-would you
Um, hold me in your arms
A-show me all your charms
Or make me sad or make-a me blue


Could you love me
Like I love you-ooo
Like I love you-ooo-ooo

Could you, a-would you
Um, a-squeeze a-hold me tight
A-love me all through the night
And never ever let me go

Could you love me
Like I love you so
Like I love you so, oh 

Every time I see you walkin' down my avenue
I say, "Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, are you alright?"
And you say, "How do ya do?"
Just like ya always do
And if I had ya in my arms tonight

Could you, a-would you,
Um hold, hold me oh so near
While I whisper in your ear
The sweet words you long to hear

Could you love me
Like I love you-ooo-ooo
Like I love you-ooo-ooo
Oh

(Instrumental)

Could you, a-would you
Um ho-old me oh so near
While I whisper in your ear
The sweet words you long to hear

Could you love me 
Like I love you-ooo-ooo
Like I love you-ooo-ooo

Jus-jus-jus-just just like I love you
Just just, just like I love you, baby
FADES
Just, just, just like I love you
