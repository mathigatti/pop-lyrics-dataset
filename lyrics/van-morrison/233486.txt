Was on a Sunday
And the autumn leaves were on the ground
I kicked my heart
When I saw you standing there in your dress of blue
The storm was over, my ship sailed through
Sings:
What is this feeling, a-what can I do?


If you an' I, could be relieved
To walk and talk and be deceived
I'd give my all and all
And more I would do, oh, yeah
If darlin', only you and I could be as two

If we could dream and by our dreams
Sew this wicked world up at the seams
I'd give my life and more I would do
If darlin', only you and I could be as two

And, baby, do you remember
All the good times we had together?
A-walkin' through the park
A-baby then, then we could sing

Give ya' all my money
Ev'rything in the world that I had
You told me, "That don't mean a thing"

If still in darkness we could run
Together, there in that mornin' sun
I'd give my all, my life and ev'rything to you
Whoa, yeah
If darlin', only you and I could be as two

Could be as two
Could be as two

Could be as two
Baby
