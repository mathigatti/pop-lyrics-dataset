Jesse James was a man
And he killed many men
He robbed the Glendale train
And he took from the richer
And he gave that to the poorer
He'd a hand and a heart and a brain


Oh Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life
Three children they were so brave
But that dirty little coward
That shot Mr. Howard
Has laid Jesse James in his grave

On Wednesday night
When the moon was shining bright
They robbed that Glendale train
And the folks from miles about (yeah they can)
They all said without a doubt
It was done by her Frankie and Jesse James (yes it was)

Oh Jessie had a wife, to mourn for his life
Three children they were so brave
But that dirty little coward
That shot Mr. Howard
Has laid (poor) Jesse James in his grave

Well the people held their breath
When they heard about Jesse's death (yeah)
And they wondered how poor Jesse came to die (how did he die?)
It was one of his guys, called Little Robert Ford
And he shot Jessie James on the sly

Oh Jessie had a wife to mourn for his life
Three children they were so brave
But that dirty little coward
That shot Mr. Howard
Has laid Jesse James in his grave
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave
He laid Jesse James in his grave
