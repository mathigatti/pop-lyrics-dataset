What will it take for them to leave me alone
Don't they know I'm just a guy who sings songs
I'm not promoting no hit record
And I don't have no TV show
And I don't have no reason to live in a goldfish bowl


I'm just doing my gigs
And I'm on and off the road
Everything I say is not meant to be set in stone
Just because they call me a celebrity
That does not make it true
'Cos I don't believe in the myth people
So why should you?

Jazz Blues &amp; Funk
That's not Rock &amp; Roll
Folk with a beat
And a little bit of Soul
I don't have no hit record
I don't have no TV show
Tell me why should I have to live in this goldfish bowl?

Well there's parasites and psychic vampires
Feeding on the public at large
Projecting their shadow onto everyone else
Well the newspaper barons
Are the scum of the lowest degree
And they prey on everybody
They prey on you and me

I'm singing Jazz Blues &amp; Funk
Baby that's not Rock &amp; Roll
Folk with a beat
And a little bit of Soul
I don't have no hit record
I don't have no TV show
So why should I want to live in this goldfish bowl?
