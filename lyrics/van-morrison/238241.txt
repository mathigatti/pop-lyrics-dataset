Well it's down the road I go
And I got those worried
Lonesome homesick Jones
Way on down the road


Well it's down the road I go
Well I got the blues
From way down in New Orleans
Way on down the road

And I got to be so far away
Oh don't you see
All our memories, dreams and reflections
That keep haunting me

Well it's down the road I go
And I hear those gypsy voices
Calling me
Way on down the road

Well I got to be
So far away in my memory
Dreams and reflections come on
Keep on back haunting me

Well it's down the road I go
Well I got the blues
From down in New Orleans
Way on down the road

Well it's down the road I go
Well I ve got the worried
Lonesome homesick Jones
Way on down the road

Way on down the road
Oh down the road
Way on down the road baby come on
Way on down the road
Trying to find my way back home
Trying to find my way back home

Further on down the road
Trying to find my way back home
Further on down the road
Down the road of peace
Down the road of peace
Down the road of peace baby
