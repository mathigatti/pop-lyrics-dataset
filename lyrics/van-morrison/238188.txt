Aryan mist
Among the bridges
You hang by the river
You've been here forever
Aryan mist


What can the matter be
In a world full of glamour
Does it lift you up
Or is it railway carriage charm

You just sit here
And look from your carriage
As you watch the scene go by

Gurus from the east
Gurus from the west
Does it lift you up
Or is it railway carriage charm

Aryan mist
Among the bridges
You hang by the river
You've been here forever
Aryan mist
Aryan mist

There's so many people
Going down by the river
Down by the river
To get clean

The fog of illusion
The fog of confusion
Is hanging all over the world

Gurus from the east
Gurus from the west
Does it lift you up
Or is it railway carriage charm

Aryan mist
You've been here forever
Remind me of Krishna
Love first sweet kiss
Aryan mist

Aryan mist
Among the bridges
You hang by the river
You've been here forever
Aryan mist

Does it lift you up
Or is it railway carriage charm
