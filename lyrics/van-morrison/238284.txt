Let's go walking where the boats go by
And watch them sail across the bay
Let me hold your hand in the morning fog
Little child I want to walk your dog 


Hey, hey girl
Hey, hey girl
You're so young
I don't know what to do 

And let's go walking up that mountain slope
And look down on the city down below
I will make a fool of you 

Hey, hey girl
Hey, hey girl
You're so young
You make me lose my mind 

Hey, a-ha, there goes your baby sister
FADES-
Lookin'
