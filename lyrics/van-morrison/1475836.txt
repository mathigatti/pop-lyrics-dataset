Near Banridge town in the county down one morning last July
From a Booring green came a sweet Colleen, 
She smiled as she passed me by
She looked so sweet, from her two bare feet to the shine of he nut brown hair
Such a coaxing little elf, sure I shook myself for to see if I was really there


Chours:
From Bantry Bay on the Derry Quay
From Gollway to Dublin town
Now a maid I seen like the Brown Colleen
That I met in the County Down

As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head
And I looked with the feelin' rare
And I say's say's I to passer by "Who's the maid with the nut brown hair?"
He smiled at me and he say's say's he "That's the gem of Ireland's crown"
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
She's the Star of the County Down

Chours:
From Bantry Bay on the Derry Quay
From Gollway to Dublin town
Now a maid I seen like the fair Colleen
That I met in the County Down

At the Harvest fair, she'll be surely there
And I dessed in my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right
For a smile from my nut brown rose
No puff of smoke, no horse I yoke and my plow is rust coloured brown
'Till the smilin' bride brought home by my side
Tis the Star of the County Down


Chours(x4)
