One of these days I've got to get things right
I'm gonna do my business in th' daylight
One of these days you know I've got to get things right
I'm gonna do my business out in the broad daylight


One of these days I've got to get things straight
I'm gonna stop acting like a reprobate
One of these days you know I've got to get things straight
I'm gonna stop staying out late
And acting like a reprobate

One of these days I've got to get in step
It won't be long 'fore I'll be needin' help
One of these days you know I've got to get in step
The way I'm going baby I'll be needin' help

One of these days I've got to go back home
Sit out on my front porch and compose a poem
One of these days you know I've got to go back home
I'm gonna sit out on my front porch, rock away compose a poem
