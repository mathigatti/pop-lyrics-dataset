Smile you smile is you and I
See through your laughing eyes
The smile you smile is you and I
See through your laughing eyes
Oh, baby
In the whirlpool of them, I
Can be in paradise


I'd go roamin' in the gloamin'
And ever and a day with you
Oh yes, I will
I'd go roamin' in the gloamin'
And ever and a day with you
Oh baby
Sit between the stars and say
That's my point of view
Oh yes

I yi, yi, yi, love you

I yi, yi, yi yi, love you

In the purple heather
On a hillside mountain fog we'll stray
Oh yeah
In the purple heather
On a hillside mountain fog we'll stray

Oh yeah
An' chase the colored grass
Around us in the same old way

I yi, yi, yi, yi love you, baby
I yi, yi, yi, yi love you, oh yeah.
