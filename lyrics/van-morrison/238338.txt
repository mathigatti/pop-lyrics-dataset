They were drinkin' his wine
They were usin' his name
They were takin' the time to take
His name in vain


Look what the good people done to him
Look what the good people done to him
They were havin' their fun
Look what the good people done

Well, the good people say things that they
Don't really mean
They look so convincing 'cause they're
So squeaky clean

Look what the good people done to him
Look what the good people done to him
It's a million to one
Look what the good people done

They (? put him on walkin' down ?), they said,
"let's go on with the show"
And they pad him on whiskey and say, "boy,
You've got to go"

Look what the good people done to him
Look what the good people done to him
He's (? on the highway ?) to none
Look what the good people done

All the newspaper men
They were lookin' for names
Pulled him out of a hat
They needed someone to blame

Look what the good people done to him
Look what the good people done to him
He thought he was the one
Look what the good people done

Well, the good people say,
"keep your nose to the ground"
Then they'll build you right up
Just to knock you right down

Look what the good people done to you
Look what the good people done to you
They were gettin' their kicks
Look what the good people nixed

[spoken - "here we go"]

Look what the good people done to me
Look what the good people done to me
Look what the good people done to me
Look what the good people done to me
They were havin' no fun
Look what the good people done
