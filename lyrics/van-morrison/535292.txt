Just like the sun shining over the mountain top
You know I'll always come again
You know I love to spend my morning time
Watchin' sunlight dancing on your skin


I've never gone so wrong for telling lies to you
What you see is what I've been
There is nothing that I can hide from you
You see me better than I ever can

Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
Darlin' I only hope, only hope that you will hold me now
Until I gain control again

Just like the lighthouse I must stand alone
Landmarks to mark the sailors journeys end
No matter what sea I've been sailing on
You know, you know I'll always roll this way, this way again
Out on the road that lies before me now
Surely there will be some turns where I will spin, spin
I only hope, I only hope that you, you will hold me now, hold me now
Till I gain, till I gain control, control again
Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns, some turns where I will spin, spin
I only hope, only hope that you will hold me now, hold me now
Until I gain control again
Till I gain control
