Chased the rainbows end


How can a poor boy deliver this message to you?
How can a poor boy? You don't believe anything that's true

Had my rise, had my downfall
Now I'm gonna rise up again
Had my degrees, my initiations
Not speaking to the profane

How can a poor boy get this message to you?
How can a poor boy when you don't believe a thing that's true?

I've been anointed, been appointed
Even been magnified
Spied a chapel all of gold
The priest was laying down with the swine

How can a poor boy get a little message to you?
How can a poor boy when you don't believe anything is true?
How can a poor boy get this message through to you?
How can a poor boy when you don't believe a single thing is true?

Watch the illusion of false security
Play of the shadows that move
Tell me what evil lurks in the hearts of men
Only the shadow knows

How can a poor boy get this message to you?
How can a poor boy when you don't believe a thing that's true, for you
When you don't believe a thing, nothing that's true for you
How can a poor boy ever get next to you?
