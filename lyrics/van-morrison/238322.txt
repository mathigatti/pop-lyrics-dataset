Goodbye Joe, me gotta go down the bayou
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we gonna have big fun on the bayou


Well, jambalaya an' a crawfish pie an' a fil'e gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar an' be gay-o
Son of a gun, we gonna have big fun on the bayou

Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin'
Hey, an' the kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Well, and-a dress in style, go hog wild an' be gay-o
Son of a gun, we gonna have big fun on the bayou

Well, jambalaya an' a crawfish pie, an' a fil'e gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Well a pick guitar, fill fruit jar an' be gay-o
Son of a gun, we gonna have a big fun on the bayou

Wanna settle down, far from town, get me a pirogue
Gonna catch all the fish in the bayou
Gonna swap my mon, to buy Yvonne, what she need-o
Son of a gun, we gonna have a big fun on the bayou

Well, jambalaya, an' a crawfish pie, an' a fil'e gumbo
'Cause, tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar an' be gay-o
Son of a gun, we're gonna have big fun on the bayou
