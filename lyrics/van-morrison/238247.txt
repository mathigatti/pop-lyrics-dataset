We shall walk again down along the lane
Down the avenue just like we used to do
With our heads so high smile at the passers by
Then we'll softly sigh ay, ay, ay, ay, ay


Chorus:
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone

By the winding stream we shall lie and dream
We'll make dreams come true if we want them to
Yes all will come play the pipes and drum
Sing a happy song and we'll sing along

[Chorus]

[Repeat 1st Verse]
