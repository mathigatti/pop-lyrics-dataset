The light is fading in the afternoon
Won't you see me baby in my room
There's something that I wanna say to you
Tell me baby am I getting through
Wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
Wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
Wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
In the afternoon, in the afternoon


The light is fading from across the way
I see you coming baby every day
I see you running, running from across the field
And I wanna know if you can feel the same as me
Cause I wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
Wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
Wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
In the afternoon, in the afternoon

The wind is howling baby outside the shack
Train whistle blowin' from across the track
Get on my wavelength, and you set me free
I just wanna be everything you want me to be
Wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
Wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
Wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
In the afternoon, in the afternoon

The moon is sinking way across the trees
I can see my baby but she can't see me
I've got a longing deep within my soul
I have to take it there and let it roll
Wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
Wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
Wanna make, wanna make, wanna make, wanna make
Love to you
In the afternoon, make love in the afternoon
Make love in the afternoon

Let it roll
You got me reelin' and a-rockin'and rollin' again

Let it roll
You got me reelin' and a-rockin'and rollin' and rollin' again
Oh, I'm rollin' and tumblin', and I'm rollin' and tumblin'
And I'm talkin' all outta my mind baby

Let it roll
You got me reelin' and a-rockin'
And I'm talkin' all outta my mind

I'm talkin' all outta my mind
Make love in the afternoon
Make love in the afternoon
Make love in the afternoon
