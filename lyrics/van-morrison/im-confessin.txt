I'm confessin' that I love you
Tell me do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you
Honest, honest I do, I do, oh yeah
In your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
I read such strange things
But your lips deny that they are true
Baby will your answer really change things?
Making me blue


I'm afraid some day you're gonna leave me
Saying, why can't we still be friends?
If you go, you know your gonna grieve me
'Cos all my life on you depends
I'm guessing, guessing that you love me
Dreaming dreams, dreaming dreams
Dreaming, dreaming. Dreaming dreams of you in vain
Woohh, I'm confessin' that I love you

Over, over, over, over and over again
Woohh I'm afraid some day
Some day you're going to leave me
Saying baby can we still be friends, old friends now
If you go, if you go you know your gonna grieve me
'Cos all my life on you depends
I'm guessing that you love me, yeah

Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming dreams of you in vain
Oh, I'm confessin' that I love you
Over and over and over and over and over and over again
I'm confessin' that I love you over and over and over
All over again, oh yeah
