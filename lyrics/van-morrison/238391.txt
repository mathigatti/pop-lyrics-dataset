Rave on John Donne, rave on thy Holy fool
Down through the weeks of ages
In the moss borne dark dank pools 


Rave on, down through the industrial revolution
Empiricism, atomic and nuclear age
Rave on down through time and space down through the corridors
Rave on words on printed page 

Rave on, you left us infinity 
And well pressed pages torn to fade
Drive on with wild abandon
Uptempo, frenzied heels 

Rave on, Walt Whitman, nose down in wet grass
Rave on fill the senses
On nature's bright green shady path 

Rave on Omar Khayyam, Rave on Kahlil Gibran
Oh, what sweet wine we drinketh
The celebration will be held
We will partake the wine and break the Holy bread 

Rave on let a man come out of Ireland
Rave on on Mr. Yeats,
Rave on down through the Holy Rosey Cross
Rave on down through theosophy, and the Golden Dawn
Rave on through the writing of "A Vision"
Rave on, Rave on, Rave on, Rave on, Rave on, Rave on 

Rave on John Donne, rave on thy Holy fool
Down through the weeks of ages
In the moss borne dark dank pools 

Rave on, down though the industrial revolution
Empiricism, atomic and nuclear age
Rave on words on printed page
