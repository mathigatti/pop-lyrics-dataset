We get it almost everynight
when that moon gets big and bright
its a supernatural delight
everybody was dancing in the moonlight



Everybody here is outta sight
they dont bark and they dont bite
they keep things loose, they keep things light
everybody was dancing in the moonlight

Dancin in the moonlight
everybody's feelin warm and bright
its such a fine and natural sight
everybody's dancin in the moonlight

we like to have fun and we never fight
you cant dance and stay uptight
its a supernatural delight
everybody was dancin in the moonlight


Dancin in the moonlight
everybody's feelin warm and bright
its such a fine and natural sight
everybody's dancin in the moonlight


Everybody here is outta sight
they dont bark and they dont bite
they keep things loose, they keep things light
everybody's dancin in the moonlight


Everybody's dancin in the moonlight
everybody's feelin warm and bright
its such a fine and natural sight
everybody's dancin in the moonlight
dancin in the moonlight
everybody's feelin warm and bright
its such a fine and natural sight
everybody was dancin in the moonlight
