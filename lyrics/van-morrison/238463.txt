Whatever happened to PJ Proby?
Wonder can you fix it Jim
Where the hell do you think is Scott Walker?
My memory's getting so dim


Don't have no frame of reference no more
Not even Screaming Lord Sutch
Without him now there's no Raving Loony Party
Nowadays I guess there's not much

To relate to anymore
Unless you wanna be mediocre
Ain't nothing new under the sun
And the moon and the stars now chum

I'm making my way down the highway
Still got a monkey on my back
I'm facing it head on and doing it my way
Please can you cut me some slack

There's nothing to relate to anymore
Unless you want to be mediocre
Ain't nothing new under the sun
And the moon and the stars now chum

Still making my way down the highway
Still got a monkey on my back
Facing head on and doing it my way
Please can you cut me some slack

All the cards fell so many rounds
Down the road a piece Jack
I saw a bus coming and I had to get on it
I'm still trying to find my way back

Whatever happened to all those dreams a while ago
Whatever happened way across the sea
Whatever happened to the way it's supposed to happen
And whatever happened to me?
