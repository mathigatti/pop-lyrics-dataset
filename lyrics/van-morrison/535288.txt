Sold me out for a few shekels and divided up my robes
They sold me out
It's the oldest story that's ever been told
They sold me out
Didn't even give it no shred of doubt, no, no
They sold me out
Didn't even sit down and try to figure it out
They just sold me out


For the few shekels more, they didn't even think twice
For a few shekels more, another minute in the spotlight

My own people did it to me just 'cos they could
They sold me out
So beware brother it could happen to you
They sold me out

For the few shekels more, they didn't even think twice
Just for a few shekels more, another minute of two in the spotlight

My own people did it to me just 'cos they could
They sold me out
Got to beware brother it just might happen to you
They sold me out
Sold me out for a few shekels and they divided up my robes
They sold me out
It's the oldest story that's ever been told
They sold me out
Sold me out for a few shekels and divided out my robes
They sold me out
It's the oldest story that's ever been known
They sold me out
They sold me out
They sold me out
They sold me out
