We stood and watched the river flow
We were too young to really know
In the country fair
Oh, in the country fair


We laid out in the long green grass
And never thought that it would pass
In the country fair
In the country fair

On an old, on an old open day
On an old rainshine open day
In the country fair
In the cool night air
In sweet summer time

We counted pebbles in the sand
Sand like time slippin' through our hand
In the country fair
In the country fair

On an old, on an old open day
On an old raintrack open day
In the country fair
In the cool night air
In sweet summer time

Hmmm mmmm
On an old open day
On an old
Pinecone open day
