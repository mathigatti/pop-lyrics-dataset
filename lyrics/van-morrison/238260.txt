There are strange things happening every day
I hear music up above my head
Fill me up with your wonder
Give me my rapture today.


Let me contemplate the presence so divine
Let me sing all day and never get tired
Fill me up from your loving cup
Give me my rapture.

Won't you guide me through the dark night of the soul
That I may better understand your way
Let me be just and worthy to receive
All the blessings of the Lord into my life.

Let me purify my thoughts and words and deeds
That I may be a vehicle for thee
Let me hold to the truth in the darkest hour
Le me sing to the glory of the Lord.
Give me my rapture today.
Repeat...
