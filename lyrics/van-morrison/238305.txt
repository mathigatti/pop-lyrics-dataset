Twenty-third of December
Covered in snow
You in the kitchen
With the lights way down low
I'm in the parlor playing my old guitar
Speaking to you, darling, to find out how you are
I wanna roo you, wanna get through to you
I wanna woo you, woo you tonight
I wanna roo you, wanna get through to you
I wanna woo you, woo you tonight


Come to me softly
Come to me quiet
Know what I'm after
I'm gonna try it
Snowstorm's on the way and we'll be stranded for a week
Come over to the window, look outside take a peek
I wanna roo you, wanna get through to you
I wanna woo you, woo you tonight
I wanna roo you, wanna get through to you
I wanna woo you, woo you tonight

You know I am lonely
And in need of your company
Oh, let your love light shine on down on me

And we can just sit here
Look at the fire
Watch the flames leaping higher and higher
Tea on the stove food in the pan
Ain't going nowhere and we don't have many plans
I wanna roo you, wanna get through to you
I wanna woo you, woo you tonight
I wanna roo you, wanna get through to you
I wanna woo you, woo you tonight

And you know I am lonely
I been in need of your company
Let your love shine on down on me
I wanna roo you, wanna get through to you
I wanna woo you, woo you tonight
I wanna roo you, wanna get through to you
I wanna woo you, woo you tonight
Woo you tonight, pretty baby
Woo you tonight, little darling
Woo you tonight, alright
Woo you tonight
