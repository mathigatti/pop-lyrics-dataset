Blue diamonds, big blue diamonds on her finger
Instead of a little band of gold
Big diamonds, big blue diamonds tell the story
Of the love that no one man could hold


Oh, she wanted more than I had money to buy
So she left me sad and lonely I am told
Big diamonds, big blue diamonds
Now she'll trade them
For a love behind a little band of gold

Blue diamonds, big blue diamonds how they sparkle
But what can they do to warm your heart and soul
When you're lonesome in the moonlight and you want loving
Big blue diamonds don't they seem so reckless and bold

I gladly do my part oh, to mend a broken heart
But a love that's warmed over soon grows cold
Big diamonds, big blue diamonds
I don't want them, no
I just want a love behind a little band of gold
