I waited for you
You waited for me
That it seemed like, seemed like a mighty long time


Baby I had to have you
Oh, I had to have you
Come rain, rain or shine

It was a cold wind in August
Shivers up and down my spine
I was standin' in your garden
In the California pine

I was standing shivering
I've got the fever in the rain
But I can't come on back to see you
Again and again and again

I said I, I had to have you
Baby I had to have you
Come rain, come rain or shine

It was a cold wind in August
Shivers up and down my spine
And I was standing in your garden

In the California pine
California pine

[instrumental]

It was a cold wind in August
Shivers up and down my spine
I was standin' in your garden
In the California pine
In the California pine It was a cold wind in August
I was pushed on through September
Oh pushin' through September
In the rain
Pushin' through, pushin' through September
In the rain

Ooh
It was a cold wind in August
Shivers up and down my spine
I was standin' standin' in your garden
In the California pine
