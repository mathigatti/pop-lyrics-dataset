If you love me
You will give your heart
Why should we be apart
If you love me


If you love me
You will know the truth
I wasn't born to lose
And I love you

Affinity and communication
That makes reality
Understanding is the first thing
It means so much to me

If I love you
I will find the key
If it's meant to be
'Cause I love you

Affinity and communication
That is reality
Understanding is the first thing
It means so much to me

If I love you
I will find the key
If it's meant to be
'Cause I love you
