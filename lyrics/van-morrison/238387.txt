You're the Queen of the slipstream
With eyes that shine
You have crossed many waters to be here
You have drank of the fountain of innocence
And experienced the long cold wintry years.


There's a dream where the contents are visible
Where the poetic champions compose
Will you breathe not a word of this secrecy, and
Will you still be my special rose?

Bridge
Goin' away far across the sea
But I'll be back for you
Tell you everything I know
Baby everything is true

Will the blush still remain
On your cheeks my love
In the light always seen
In your head?
Gold and sliver they placed
At your feet my dear
But I know you chose me.
Instead
Goin' away... etc.
You're the Queen of the slipstream
I love you so
You have crossed many waters to be here
And you drink at the fountains of innocence
And experienced, you know very well
