Told ya' darlin', all along
I was right and you were wrong
A-pleasin' you, so hard to do
Cried all night long, was beatin' through


Can't sow wild oats, 'spect to gather corn
Can't take right and make it wrong
Told ya' darlin', long time ago
You gotta reap, what you sow, and what you sow

Yeah-eah, is gonna make you weep
Some day, some day, some day
Yeah, what you sow-oh, yeah 
Is gonna make you weep

Tried to keep you satisfied
Broke my heart, crushed my pride
It's all over now, but all I see
Is a lonely road, and a memory
Of daily walkin', and talkin', 'bout Joanne
Can't ya' see, I said, daily walkin', an' talkin'

Can't sow wild oats, 'spect to gather corn
Can't take right and make it wrong
I told ya' darlin', long time ago
You gotta reap, what you sow, and what you sow
Yeah-eay is gonna make you weep
A-some day, a-some day, some day
Yeah, what you sow, yeah-eay
Gonna make you weep, a-some days
