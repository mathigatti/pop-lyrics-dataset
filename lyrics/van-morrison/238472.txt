Open your arms in the early mornin'
When the light comes shinin' through
Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
It's beating so wild, honey.
And light comes shinin'
Singin' my song
And the band is playin'
And the music is tried and true
Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
It's beating so wild, honey.
And light comes shinin'
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting here for me
Way up on the mountain
Where the hillside rolls down to the sea
Tell me what's real?
What I feel inside
Any time of day or night will do
It's alright
Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
It's beating so wild, honey.
And your light comes shining through.
Tell me what's real
What I feel inside
Any time of day or night will do
It's alright.
Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
It's beating so wild, honey.
And the light comes shining through
And the light comes shining through...
It's beating so wild...
And the light comes shining through
And the light comes shining through.
