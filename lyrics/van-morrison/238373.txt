Only a dream
That I had in the night
Only a dream
But It felt so right


We were standing in the moonlight
I was holding you tight
But it was only a dream

Only a dream
And that knocked me off of my feet
Only a dream
It was dancing in the street

And the big band kept on playing
Of Bonaparte's retreat
But it was only a dream

Only a dream
But somebody
Tried to knock it down

Only a dream
But that dream
Keeps hanging around

Only a dream
We were roiling in the snow
Only a dream
And we just couldn't let go

I sat outside the window
It was just like Romeo
But it was only a dream

Only a dream but somebody
Tried to knock it down
Only a dream but that dream
Is still around

Up on Mockingbird hill
And I'm feeling no pain
Ali the birds are singing
Their all so sweet refrain

If I had to do it all over
I'd do the same thing again
'Cos it was only a dream

Oh 'cos it s only a dream
That knocked me off of my feet

Only a dream
We were dancing
Out in the street

And the big band kept on playing
Of Bonaparte's retreat
But it was only a dream

Oh but it was only just a dream
Din but it was only a dream
Oh but it was only a dream
Oh what a dream
