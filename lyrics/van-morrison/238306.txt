Whenever the sunshine comes through
Whenever my thoughts turn to you
Whatever you want me to do
I will be there


Whether I crawl uphill
Try to not be through the mill
Just as long as I fit the bill
I will be there

If it's on a lazy afternoon in summertime
And you're drinking champagne and wine
Anytime, I don't mind
Even if I've got the blues
And after I pay all my dues
You decide to go for a cruise
I will be there

And if it's on a lazy afternoon in summertime
And you're drinking champaigne and wine
Anytime, I don't mind
And even if I've got the blues
I'm tired of paying oh so many dues
And you decide to go for a cruise
Going to grab my razor and my suitcase 
And my toothbrush and my overcoat 
And my underwear
I will be there
