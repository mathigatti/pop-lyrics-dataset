Come here my love
This feeling has me spellbound
Yet the storyline, in paragraphs, 
Laid down the same
In fathoms of my inner mind
I'm mystified, oh, by this mood
This melancholy feeling 
That just don't do no good


Come here my love
And I will lift my spirits high for you
I'd like to fly away and spend a day or two
Just contemplating the fields and leaves 
And talking about nothing
Just layin' down in shades of effervescent, effervescent odors
And shades of time and tide
And flowing through
Become enraptured by the sights and sounds 
In intrigue of nature's beauty
Come along with me
And take it all in
Come here my love
