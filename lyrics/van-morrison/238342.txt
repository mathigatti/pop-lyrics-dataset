Lost in a strange city
Nowhere to turn
Far cry from the streets that 
I came from 
It can get lonely 
When you're travelling hard
But you can even be lonely 
Standing in your own backyard


Nobody knows the existential dread
Of the things that go on inside
Someone else's head 
Whether it be trivial 
Or something that Dante said 
But baby nobody knows the meaning of loneliness

No matter how well you know someone
You can only ever guess
How can you ever really know somebody else?
It takes more than a lifetime 
Just to get to know yourself 
Nobody know the meaning of loneliness

I have to say a word about solitude 
For the soul it sometimes they say can be good
I'm partial to it myself I must confess
Nobody knows the meaning of loneliness

Well there's Sarte and Camus, Nietzsche and Hesse
If you dig deep enough
You gonna end up in distress
And no one escapes having to live life under duress
And no on escapes the meaning of loneliness

Well they say keep it simple when it gets to be a mess
And fame and fortune
Never brought anyone happiness
I must be lucky 
Some of my friends think that I'm really blessed
Nobody knows the meaning of loneliness

Bright lights, big city nowhere to run 
Far cry from the streets where I was born 
I've been doing some travelling 
Sometimes the road gets hard 
But you can also be lonely 
Standing in your own backyard

No, no, no, no, no, no, nobody knows 
The meaning of loneliness
No, no, no, no, nobody knows 
The meaning of lonelinss
Nobody knows the meaning of loneliness
