Lord if I ever needed someone I need you
Lord if I ever needed someone I need you


To see me through the daytime 
And through the long lonely night
To lead me through the darkness
And on into the light
To stand with me through my strife
When times get so uncertain to turn to 
To you in my young life 

Lord if I ever needed someone I need you
Lord if I ever needed someone I need you

Someone to hold onto 
And keep me from all fear
Someone to be my guiding light
And keep me ever dear
To keep me from my selfishness
To keep me from my sorrow
To lead me on to givingness
So I can see a new tomorrow

Lord if I ever needed someone I need you
Lord if I ever needed someone I need you

Someone to walk with
Someone to hold my hand
Someone to talk with
Someone to understand

To call on when I need you 
And I need you very much
To open up my arms to you 
And feel your tender touch
To feel it and to keep it 
Just right here in my soul
And care for it and keep it with me 
Never to grow old 

Lord if I ever needed someone I need you
Lord if I ever needed someone I need you
