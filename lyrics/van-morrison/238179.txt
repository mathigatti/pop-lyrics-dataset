I'm Alabamy bound
I'm Alabamy bound
And if the train don't stop 'n turn around
I'm Alabamy bound


Don't you leave me here
Don't you leave me here
The locomos ghost suite pullin' out
Leave a dime for a beer

I'm Alabamy bound (I'm Alabamy bound)
I'm Alabamy bound (I'm Alabamy bound)
And if the train don't stop and turn around
I'm Alabamy bound (I'm Alabamy bound)

(Hair don't curl)
And your eyes ain't blue
'Cause if you don't want me, sweet Polly Ann
(Well, I don't want you)

Alabamy bound (I'm Alabamy bound)
I'm Alabamy bound (I'm Alabamy bound)
And if the train down stop and turn around
I'm Alabamy bound (I'm Alabamy bound)

I'm Alabamy bound (don't cha leave me here) umm
I'm Alabamy bound (don't cha leave me here)
I'm Alabamy bound (don't cha leave me here)
I'm Alabamy bound
