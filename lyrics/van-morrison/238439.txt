Down those old ancient streets
Down those old ancient roads
Baby there together we must go
Till we get the healing done
Till we get the healing done


Till you're satisfied with your life
Till you're satisfied with your life
Till you're satisfied with your life
And it's running right, and it's running right

Till you deal with the poison inside
Sometimes you've got to sit down and cry
When you deal with the poison inside
Till we get the healing done
Till we get the healing done

Till you feel the tingle up your spine
Till you're satisfied and you're mine
Till you feel a tingle up your spine
Till we get the healing done
Till we get the healing done

Till you live in the glory of the One
Till you live in the land of the sun
Till you feel like your life has just begun
Till we get the healing done
Till we get the healing done

Till we dwell in the house of the Lord
Till you don't have to worry no more
Till you open a brand new world
Till we get the healing done
Till we get the healing done

Till it makes you feel alright
Till you're satisfied with your life
Till you know you live in the Light
Till we get the healing done
Oh till we get the healing done

Till you look at the mountains every day
Till you wash all your troubles away
And you live right here in the day
Till we get the healing done
Oh till we get the healing done

Oh till it's Truth and it's beauty and it's grace
Till you've finally found your true place
Till you know your original face
Till we get the healing done
Oh child, till we get the healing done

Oh when everything's going right
Till you're satisfied with your life
Till you're living in the Light
Till we get the healing done
Oh till we get the healing done

Oh when you feel it, when you feel it in your soul
Baby, and you really know
That you reap just what you sow
When we get the healing done
Oh till we get the healing done
Till you know that it's working every time
Till you work it out in your mind
And you know it straight down the line
Till you get the healing done
Oh make no worry till we get the healing done

Oh we gonna go back, back to our favourite place
Oh look at it again
See it all through different eyes
When we get the healing done
Oh when we get the healing done

Oh we're living for the grace of the Lord
Baby feel so good about it all
Oh give thanks every day
Till we get the healing done
Oh till we get the healing done
Till we get the healing done

Oh baby, baby till we get the healing done
Till we get the healing done
Baby you got to stay
Till we get the healing done

If it takes to the break of day
Till we get the healing done
Till we get the healing done
Till we get the healing done
Till we get the healing done
You got to stay all night long
Till we get the healing done
