I don't want no Cadillac
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C
One I got gonna take it back
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C
Came out the house early this mornin'
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C
Old Cadillac don't give me no warnin'
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C


Ooh, ooh, Cadillac
Cadillac

Looked in the trunk and there weren't no jack
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C
I'm gonna take this Cadillac back
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C
Oh, Willy and Lilly came walkin' up the street
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C
Well, give me a wink makin' fun of me
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C

Go, ooh, Cadillac
Cadillac
(Ow!)

Go, ooh, Cadillac
Cadillac

Hopped in the car but the car wouldn't start
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C
Cadillac is breakin' my heart
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C
Got it started put it into drive
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C
Wilder than the baby by my side
C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C
(Ow!)

Go, ooh, Cadillac
Cadillac

Go, go
Go, ooh, Cadillac
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Go, ooh, Cadillac
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Go, oh, Cadillac
