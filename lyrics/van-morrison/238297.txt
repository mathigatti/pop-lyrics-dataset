I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to think you got it made
Do exactly what you wanna do
I just wanna make love to you, that's alright


I don't want you to run around like you got it made
Don't want you to run around like the Ace of Spades
Do exactly what you plan to do
I just wanna make love to you, that's alright

I can tell by the way you swish and walk
See by the way you baby talk
An' I, know by the way you understand
Love me baby, love me baby, love me baby
Til a, cryin' shame

Yeah, I don't want ya to think ya got it made
I don't want ya to run around like the Ace of Spades
Do exactly what you wanna do
I just wanna make love to you, that's alright

[Instrumental &amp; guitar solo]

I can tell by the way you swish and walk
See by the way you baby talk
An' I, know by the way you understand, I just
Love me baby, love me baby, love me baby
Til a, cryin' shame

I don't want ya to bake my bread
I don't want ya to make, make my bed
I don't want ya to be sad an' blue
I just wanna make, if that's alright

Whoa, yeah!
An' whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
An' whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah

Her hearts a stone
Her hearts a stone
And, I just wanna make...[pause]
