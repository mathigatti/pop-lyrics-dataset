See you've got the new biography
Where did they get the info from
Same as before some, so called friends
Who claim to have, known me then
How come they've got such good memories
And I can't even remember last week
Got to queston where they're coming from
What knowledge of me is it that they speak


So far away, way back when
The people that claim, to have known me then
Not on my wavelength and it's such a shame
That they have to play the name game
The fame game, oh the name game,
Lord it's a cryin' shame
Lord tell me what's to blame

Reinvented all the stories they know
Give them all a different slant
What is it that they're really looking for
Just a hobby on the internet

So far away, way back when
The people that claim, to have known me then
Not on my wavelength and it's such a shame
That they have to play the name game
The fame game, the name game,
Oh it's such a cryin' shame, tell me who's to blame

If they didn't really know me way back
How can they know me now, in any respect
It's a pity they don't feel the pain
That they should pay the price to play, to play
The fame game, the name game
It's such a cryin' shame, please tell me who's to blame

Not on my wavelength and it's such a shame
That they have to play, have to play the fame game
Oh the name game, it's a cryin' shame
Please tell me who's to blame
They keep on playin'
The fame game, oh the name game
It's such a cryin' shame, please tell me who's to blame
Keep on playin' the fame game
Lord, the name game, its such a cryin' shame
Please tell me who's to blame
They just keep on playin' the fame game
Oh the name game, its such a cryin' shame
Please tell me who's to blame
Keep on, keep on playin'..
