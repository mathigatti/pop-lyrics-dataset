I've seen, so many lovers cry
Lost love, makes me wonder why
I've found a love, a once in a lifetime love
Angel on high, from heaven so high above
So I thank God for sending me you


I have heard of playing around with numbers
But one is all I need
She can't be beat, she makes me complete
On Quality Street

I have heard of playing around with numbers
But one is all I need
She can't be beat, she makes me complete
On Quality Street

I have lived alone, until you came along
And you gave me love
And my dream came true
And God gave me you

I see, the end of the rainbow now
True love, has blessed me somehow
Blessing of love, a once in a lifetime love
Angel on high, from heaven so high above
So I thank God for sending me you

I have heard of playing around with numbers
But one is all I need
She can't be beat, she makes me complete
On Quality Street

Quality Street
On Quality Street
Quality, Quality, Quality, Quality Street
Quality Street
On Quality Street.
