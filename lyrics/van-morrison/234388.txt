Who drove the red sports car from the mansion
And laid upon the grass in summer time
And who done me out high time fashion
And made me read between the lines
And who said follow the man it's your only chance
Sit on your throne, you got to make it on your own, on your own 


And who said
Look at you, look at you
You got jam on your face and
Who did your homework and read your Bible,
And signed your name everyplace and
Who said fortunes untold don't go by gold,
You're much better known
You got to make it on your own, on your own. 

And do you remember, do you remember
I said a long time ago when I came walkin' down
I came walkin' down
Maggie's place
It started comin' on rain,
It started comin' on rain,
'Cause I had nothin' on but a shirt
And a pair of pants
And I was gettin' wet,
And I was gettin' wet,
Saturated, saturated
And Maggie opened up the window
And Jane swung out her right arm,
She said, Hi! I said, Hi! ya.
How're your doin' baby.
She said, Come on in out of the rain
Come on in out of the rain, Lord,
Come on in out of the rain. 

Sit down by the fireside
Dry yourself,
Do, do it,
I got caught,
I got caught,
In a bag.
