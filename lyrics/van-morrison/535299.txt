(Da da da....)

When you were a child, you were a tomboy
Gimme soul satisfaction
Way back in shady lane
Do you remember darlin'?


And it's the woman in you, and it's the woman in you
Gimme soul satisfaction
And it takes the child in you to know
The woman an' you are one

We're goin' out in the country to get down to the real soul,
I mean the real soul, people,
We're goin' out in the country, get down to the real soul
We're gettin' out to the west coast
Shining our light into the days of bloomin' wonder
Goin' as much with the river as not, as not, yeah, yeah
An' I'm goin' as much with the river as not
Yeah, yeah, right, yeah

Blake and the Eternals oh standin' with the Sisters of Mercy
Looking for the Veedon Fleece, yeah
William Blake and the Eternals oh standin' with the Sisters of Mercy
Looking for the Veedon Fleece, yeah
You don't pull no punches, but you don't push the river
You don't pull no punches, and you don't push the river
You don't pull no punches, and you don't push the river, no, no
Goin' as much with the river as not

We're goin' out in the West, down to the cathedrals
We're goin' out in the West (alright), down to the beaches
And the Sisters of Mercy, behind the sun
Oh behind the sun

And William Blake and the Sisters of Mercy looking for the Veedon Fleece,
Yeah
You don't pull no punches, goin' west, goin' as much with the river as not
With the river as not, with the river as not, goin' as much,
Goin' as much with the river as not, no, ah
You don't pull no punches, and you don't push the river, no
You don't pull no punches, but you don't push the river, no
You don't pull no punches, but you don't push the river, no
You don't pull no punches, but you don't push the river

And we was contemplating Baba, William Blake and the Eternals
Goin' down to the Sisters of Mercy
Looking for the Veedon Fleece
Looking for the Veedon Fleece
Looking for the Veedon Fleece
Looking for the Veedon Fleece

You don't pull no punches, but ya, you don't push the river
You don't pull no punches, but ya, you don't push the river, no
You don't pull no punches, but ya, you don't push the river
You don't push the river, you don't push the river
