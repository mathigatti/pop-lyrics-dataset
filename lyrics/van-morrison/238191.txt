On down by Avalon
Avalon of the heart
On down by Avalon
Gonna make a brand new start


Oh the Holy Grail
Baby behind the sun
Oh the Holy Grail
Down by Avalon

Well I came upon
The enchanted vale
Down by the viaducts of my dreams
Down by Camelot, hangs the tale
In the ancient vale

Oh the Avalon sunset
Avalon of the heart
Me and my lady
Goin' down by Avalon

Well I came upon
The enchanted vale
Down by the viaducts of my dreams
Near Camelot, hangs the tale
Of the enchanted vale

In the upper room
There the cup does stand
In the upper room
Down by Avalon

Goin' down by Avalon
Oh my Avalon of the heart
Goin' down by Avalon
Gonna make a brand new start

Oh down by Avalon
Oh baby behind the sun
Goin' down by Avalon
Well the journey's just begun

Oh down by Avalon
Sweet Avalon of the heart
Goin' down by Avalon
Gonna make a brand new start
