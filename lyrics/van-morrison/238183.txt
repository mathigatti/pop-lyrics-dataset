All work and no play
Makes Jack a dull chap
When it comes to the crunch
It s too much I've got to stop
No pain and no gain it s driving me insane


I d like to be somewhere else
Like to be all by myself
Like to be down at the beach
Relaxing at the sugar shack
Hot dogs coffee black
Coca cola kicking back

I'm just a wild and crazy guy
But I m tearing at the seams
Before you can say Jack Robinson
I'll be seeing you in my dreams
She's on a blanket with a book
In the shade, white suit

Happy hour at the bar
And I m jamming with some friends
We're up to the same tricks
Drinking cocktails getting our kicks
Later on by the pool
Looking good ah, be cool

There's no craic double back
Moving on down the track
Moving on down the line
Got to chill out in style
Got to ease my troubled mind
Thinking just might be a crime

All work and no play
Makes Jack a dull chap
When it comes to the crunch
It's too much I've got to stop
No pain no gain it's all going
Down the drain
