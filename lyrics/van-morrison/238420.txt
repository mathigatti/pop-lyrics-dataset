I'm waiting
for my royalty check to come,
and it still hasn't come yet.
It's about a year
over due.
I guess it's coming
from the Big Royalty Check in the sky.
I waited and the mailman
never dropped it in my letterbox.
Oh, oh-oh, oh...
I guess it's a Big Royalty Check in the sky.
Oooh baby.
But you can't
beat the tax man
and me
all at once.
