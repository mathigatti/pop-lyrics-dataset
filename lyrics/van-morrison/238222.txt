I'm thinkin' 'bout a place
I'm waitin' for the day
When I will make my get away
Because as any fool can see
There's nothin' here for me but
Hurry up boy bring that water
Don't do things you shouldn't oughta


But when I go away and find my easy street
I'll have a smile for all I meet
And they will welcome me I know
Everywhere I go
No more thinkin' that I've missed it How can anyone resist it
And there's a chance
That I will find my big romance
When I get to my city home

But when I go away
And find my easy street
I'll have a smile for all I meet
And they will welcome me I know
Everywhere I go
I'll see the town in all its glitter
How could anyone be bitter
And there's a chance
That I will find my big romance
When I get to my city home
