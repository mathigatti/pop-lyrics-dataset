[Spoken:]
When I first came to town, people
I was walking down Hasting Street
Everybody was talkin' about, Henry Swing Club
I decided to stop in there for awhile
And man, when I got there
Yeah, they were really havin' a ball


[Sings:]
Well, I feel so good
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Well, to the break of day
(Say, it again)

Well, I feel so good
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Well, to the break of day
(Alright)

When I was a young boy
I was layin' down one night
And I heard ma and pa talkin'
I heard pa tell ma
"Hey, come on, let that boy boogie-woogie
'Cause you know it's in him
And it's just got to come out"
'Cause it's in him
And it's just got to come out

Well, feels so good, child
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Lord, 'til the break-a day
(Chillen, I'm chillen here)

Well, feels so good, now Lord
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Yeah-ow, 'til the break of day
