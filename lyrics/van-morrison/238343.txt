Mechanical bliss is striking me for what I believe in
A ribbon on the line, and getting in and getting out
Huh, huh, huh ...... huh, huh huh
Was not like this


No, mechanical bliss was not like this at all
The ribbon on the line, and getting in and getting out was not like this
Was not like this, was not like this

Caruthers and Smith said that they couldn't come at all
They said that their backs were up against the wall
And getting in and getting out was not like this
Was not like this, was not like this

But a flash of the list, the flick of a switch
A flick of a switch, you gave me a kiss, I couldn't resist
No ooooooooooooooo mechanical bliss

Now Ponsonby-Smith said he really didn't care
About Neville and Chippy who really wasen't there
And getting in and getting out was not like this
Was not like this

He's out in the sun, he's sucking his thumb
He's talking to hum Ahhhhhhhh mechanical bliss

Mechanical bliss will not like this, mechanical bliss was not like this at all
The ribbon on the line and getting in and getting out was not like this
Was never, never like this

I couldn't resist the flash of the list
A flick of the switch, the lisp
He talked in a lisp
You gave me a kiss,
You talked in a lisp
You talked in a liiiiiii eh eh eh sp
Mechanical bliss

Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
Nah, nah, nah, nah nah
Dah, da , dah, dah, dah, dah do
SCAT!

Dah, da , dah, dah, dah, dah do

O.K. Chaps, stiff upper lip!
