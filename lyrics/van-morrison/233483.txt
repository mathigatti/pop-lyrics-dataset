Call of the wildest, it's got the best of you
Fire in my heart, fire in my belly too
Got a heart and a mind and a fire inside
And I'm crazy about you
You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you when you're laughing out loud
You, you with your hidden surprise
You


Stoke up my engine, bring me my driving wheel
Once I get started you'll see just how I feel
And I'm crazy about you
And I'm crazy about you
And I'm crazy about you
You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you when you're laughing out loud
You, you with your hidden surprise
You

Gotta get through January
Gotta get through February
Gotta get through January
Gotta get through February
Gotta get through January
Gotta get through February
Gotta get through January

Spring in my heart, fire in my belly too
I come apart, I don't know just what to do
Got a heart and a mind and a fire inside
And I'm crazy about you
You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you with the laugh in your eyes
You, you with your hidden surprise
You

Gotta get through January
Gotta get through February
Gotta get through January
Gotta get through February
Gotta get through January
Gotta get through February
Gotta get through January

Spring in my heart, fire in my belly too
I come apart, I don't know just what to do
Got a heart and a mind and a fire inside
And I'm crazy about you
You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you with the laugh in your eyes
You, you with your hidden surprise
You
