Gotta spread the news in the regions again
I'm gonna sing my blues in the regions again
Gonna blow my fuse 'cause I wanna cut loose
In the regions again


Wanna dance by you by the light of the moon
I wanna see you there on a bright afternoon
I wanna sing my song, won't you play me the tune
In the regions again

In the Celtic Spring
In the Celtic Spring
Won't you come and go

Wanna go to the regions again
Wanna go to the regions again
I gotta go to the regions again

In the Celtic Spring
In the Celtic Spring
Won't you come and go

Gotta spread the news in the regions again
I'm gonna sing my blues in the regions again
I wanna blow my fuse 'cause I wanna cut loose
In the regions again
Gonna dance with you by the light of the moon
Wanna see you there on a bright afternoon
I wanna sing my song, won't you play me the tune
In the regions again
In the regions again
In the regions again
In the regions again
In the regions again
In the regions again
In the regions again

In the Celtic Spring
In the Celtic Spring
Won't you come and go
