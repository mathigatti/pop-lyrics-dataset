Carry on regardless, in spite of the music business scam
Carry on regardless, in spite of all the
Petty minded little women and men
Carry on regardless, when
Everybody don't give a damn


Carry on and start all over again, in spite of all the tv trash
Carry on regardless, in spite of all the media rehash
And the white wash, the brain wash and all the white trash
Carry on regardless, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby when your on a roll
Carry on regardless, just to satisfy your soul

Carry on up the khyber, carry on, carry on dick
Carry on up the khyber pass
Won't you carry on, carry on dick
Carry on you got to make it last
Carry on you gotta make it stick
Carry on baby when, when you're on a roll
Carry on baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Got to satisfy your soul
Carry on up the khyber pass
Carry on doctor, carry on nurse
Carry on regardless, carry on doctor, carry on nurse
Carry on till you get what your after
Carry on till it can't get much worse

Carry on regardless
Carry on up, carry on up, carry on up
Carry on up, carry on up, carry on up
Carry on do the dog, carry on do the crazy pup, alright
Carry on forever
Carry on until you make it stick
