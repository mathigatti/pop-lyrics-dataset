You ain't never had to cry baby
Don't start cryin' now
You ain't never had to cry baby
Don't start cryin' now
You never did it before
Don't do you know good no how


Cry cry baby, cry cry, all night long
Cry cry baby, cry cry, all night long
You're gonna wake up in the mornin'
And find your good man gone

Well you brag 'bout your woman
Take one look at mine
Well you brag 'bout your woman
A take one look at mine
She's as sweet as any angel
Make-a love most all the time 

Cry cry baby, cry cry all night long
Cry cry baby, cry cry all night long
You might wake up in the morning
And find your good man gone

Ooh! 

Well I sent for you yesterday
Here you come walkin' today
Well I sent for you yesterday
Here you come walkin' today
Got you all fired up
And don't know what I said

Cry cry baby, cry cry all night long
Cry cry baby, cry cry all night long
Gonna wake up in the mornin'
Find your good man gone

Well cry cry baby, cry cry all night long
(Well) cry cry baby, cry cry all night long
You're gonna wake up in the mornin'
And find your good man gone
