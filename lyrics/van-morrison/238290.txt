I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years
A little while, tell me now
How long has this been going on?


There were chills, up and down my spine
Yes, there're thrills I can't define
Listen sweet, while I repeat
How long has this been going on?

Oh I could feel that I could melt
Into heaven I'm hurled
Oh I know how Leif Erickson felt
Finding another world
Kiss me once, and then once more
Oh what a dunce I was before
What a break, for heaven's sake
How long has this been going on?
