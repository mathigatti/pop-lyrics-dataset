What's wrong with this picture?
There's something I'm not seeing here
What's wrong with this picture?
Something that's not exactly clear
What's wrong with this picture?
Does it look like it's just another sting?
'Cos it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing and ring a ding ding


What's wrong with this picture?
Doesn't anybody see
That's who everyone thought
That I used to be
What's wrong with this picture?
It's only hanging on a wall
So you can go right back to sleep
And just forget about it all, because

I'm not that person anymore
I'm living in the present time
Baby, don't you understand
I've left all that jive behind

You can't believe what you read in the papers
Or half the news that's on TV
Or the gossip of the neighbours
Or anyone who doesn't want you to be free

I'm not that person anymore
I'm always living in the present time
Don't you understand
I left all that jive behind

What's wrong with this picture?
It's only hanging on the wall
Why don't we take it down and
Just forget about it 'cos that ain't me at all
