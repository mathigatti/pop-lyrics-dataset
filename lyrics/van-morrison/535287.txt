There stands the glass
That will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain
It's my first one today


There stands the glass
That will hide all my tears
That will drown all my fears
Brother I'm on my way

I wonder where you are tonight
I wonder if you are all right
I wonder if you think of me
In my misery

There stands the glass
Fill it up to the brim
While my troubles grow dim
It's my first one today

I wonder where you are tonight
I wonder if you are all right
I wonder if you think of me
In my misery

There stands the glass
Fill it up to the brim
While my troubles grow dim
It's my first one today

There stands the glass
That will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain
It's my first one today

There stands the glass
That will hide all my tears
That will drown all my fears
Brother I'm on my way

I wonder where you are tonight
I wonder if you are all right
I wonder if you think of me
In my misery

There stands the glass
Fill it up to the brim
While my troubles grow dim
It's my first one today

I wonder where you are tonight
I wonder if you are all right
I wonder if you think of me
In my misery

There stands the glass
Fill it up to the brim
While my troubles grow dim
It's my first one today
