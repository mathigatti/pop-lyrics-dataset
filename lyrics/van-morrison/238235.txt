In the cul de sac, so smooth
I look down
Be less sure, sir
And take your rest


It's been much too long
Since we drifted in song
Lay it down wet
In this hide-away

Oh I travelled far
To the nearest star
And met Palomar...mar...mar...
And we don't care just who you know
It's who you are
And when they all go home
Down the cobblestones
You can double back (spoken "This is it")
To a cul de sac
Mmm

Oh, I travelled far
The nearest star
And Mount Palomar, Palomar, Palomar, Palomar
And we don't care just who d'you know who d'you know
And who you really are, really are

And when they all,
All go home
Down the cobblestones
You will double back
To a cul de sac
You know, you know you will
You will, oh, will double back
And not very far
To a cul de sac
You, you, you...will double back
To a cul de sac
You know, you know it's not very far away
No, no
It's just a cul de sac

And you know, and you know, and you know...it's not very very far away,
No
It's just a cul de sac
Donn, donn, donn...
You're not very far away, No ohhh
It's not, it's not very far away
It's not as far as a country mile
(You got it)
It's just a cul de sac
