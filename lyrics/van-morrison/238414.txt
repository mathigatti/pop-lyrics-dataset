Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
All about your love, all about your love


Every little bit
Every little bit of my heart sings
Every little song
Every little song that your love brings
And every day, in every little way
Your love shows
And every day, in every way
Our love grows

You've gotta tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
All about your love, all about your love

Lovin' only you, lovin' that is true
Is my prime delight
Lovin only you, lovin' that is true
In the morning light
Couldn't be another one, uh, no couldn't be another one
Set my soul on fire
Never be another one, never, never be another one
You're my heart's desire

Come on and tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
All about your love, all about your love

Ain't it real, ain't it true
Can you feel it
Feel it

Ain't it real, me and you
Can you feel it
Feel it

Darlin', darlin' darlin', darlin'

Come into my arms
Cuddle up, take your time, girl
Show me all your many charms
Let me know that you're mine, girl
Tell me that your the sweetest wine
Like the river let them flow
This is so complete a time
You gotta let me know
Let me know, let me know

You gotta tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
All about your love, all about your love
All about your love, all about your love

Come on and tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me tell me baby
All about your love, all about your love
Tell me all about your, all about, all about all about your love
Tella me, tella me, tella me, tella me
