Well i'm sick and tired
Of your alibis,
And your indiscreet lies
Just won't get you by,
Over and over and over and over again.


And your family,
Your forced superiority,
Your azure delusions of grandeur,
Are gonna cut you free,
Over and over and over and over again.

You're as cold as ice.
Ahh, you're not miss nice,
And i paid the price.

Ahh, you can count me out.
Oh, without a doubt,
I paid the price.

And up and down, 'round, 'round you go,
But you know one monkey
Don't stop no show.

It's plain to see
You're in need of help,
But i just can't go on
And whip myself
Over and over and over, over again.

Ahh, you can count me out.
Ahh, without a doubt,
You know, i paid the price.
Ahh, you're not miss nice.
You're as cold as ice,
And i paid the price.
Yes i did.
You know i did.

And i just wanna know
Who's your sponsor.
I just wanna know, oh,
I just a-wanna know, oh,
I just a-wanna know, oh,
Who's your angel.
