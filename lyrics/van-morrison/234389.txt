If you leave me, if you grieve me
What would I do without you to see me through.
If you hurt me, if you desert me
What would I do, without you, to see me through.


What would I do
Tell me I wanna know
Who would I see
What would I know.

Well I'm crazy about my baby
What would I do without you, to see me through.
What would I do
Tell me I wanna know
Who would I see
Where would I go.

Well I'm crazy about my baby
What would I do without you, to see me through.
