They say you came from heaven but I know that's not the truth,
Cause I don't think an angel could look anything like you,
Your eyes are made from sapphires and your heart is made from stone,
You gotta be the closest thing to hate I've ever known,
And if I didn't know better I'd say you had come alone to the party.
Oh yeah.


The light is always shining, but you swear that it's gone black,
The tide is always turning, but you're never looking back,
If I didn't know better I'd say times were pretty bad,
Because Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,
Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, gonna die.

The gifts you bring are fire, and your dreams they turned to dust,
Your flying days are over, and your wings have turned to rust.
If I didn't know better, I'd say all you had is lost,
Because Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,
Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, gonna die.

If you swallow just a little pride, you might find a little love inside,
Open up and let somebody in, 'cause if you need somebody,
You know it's not a sin.

Rusty Angels they can't fly, Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,
Rusty Angels they can't fly, no, Rusty Angels gonna die,
Gonna die, yeah, you can't fly, oh no,
Gonna die, oh yeah, you can't fly, oh no.
