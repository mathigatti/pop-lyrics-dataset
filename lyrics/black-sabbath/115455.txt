Where Do You Go When Your Conscience Takes Over
Do You Crawl To Your Corner And Cry.
Did You Imagine, That No One Would Notice
Just A Secret To Take When You Die.


All The World Is Watching You,
Every Tongue Is Screaming
Sinner

How Are Your Dreams? Do They Claw At Your Sleep?
Making Darkness A Place You Despise,
Where Is The God, That Once Was Your Strength
Are You Sure He Was There From The Start?

All The World Is Watching You, Nowhere You Can Hide,
Every Tongue Is Screaming, Only Satan Hears Your Cries.

When You Sin Cardinal Sin, You Make Your Bed And On It You Must
Lie, You Must Lie
And Your Future's Looking Grim, But Did You Ever Give A Damn
About The Child, He's Running Wild.
When You Sin Cardinal Sin, Don't Expect The World Will Treat You
Well,
Do You Think That God Will Forgive You All Your Sins Now
When You Need To Sell Your Soul?

We Point The Finger, Sin Cardinal Sin
Laugh In Your Face, Sin Cardinal Sin,
We Point The Finger, Laugh In Your Face,
Cause You're No Better Than The Rest Of The Human Race.

Oh Sin Cardinal Sin, Oh Sin Cardinal Sin.
