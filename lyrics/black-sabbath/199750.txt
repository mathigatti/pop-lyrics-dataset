There's no end - there's no beginning
To the old man's story
Does he still remember me 
From lives gone by
Oh I see his spirit rising
Upon the back of time
I've got nowhere to hide
Will he keep a place for me


He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings

In his eyes an ocean's burning
Swollen seas of tears
Troubled mind the beating
War drums in his ears
No one ever hears his warning
Am I the one he calls
When they tell me they're afraid
Some say I'll be put away

He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings
My blood will spill my blood

My blood will spill my blood

In the wisdom of the prophet's
Never ending tale
Open up the eyes
Within your mind, he says
Crowned in his ancient glory
There's a king within us all
Some will say it's all in vain
That he doesn't have a name

He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light 
He holds eternity's wings
