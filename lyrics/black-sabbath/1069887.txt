Everybody's looking at me
Feeling paranoid inside
When I step outside I feel free
Think I'll find a place to hide
Tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?


Every day I sit and wonder
How my life it used to be
Now I feel like going under
Now my life is hard to see
So tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?

So I'm telling all you people
Listen while I sing again
If I don't sound very cheerful, I think that I'm a schizophren
So tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?
