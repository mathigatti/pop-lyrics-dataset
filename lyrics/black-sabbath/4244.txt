Reflex in the sky
Warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you'd better hide
From the atomic tide
Flashes in the sky
Turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay
Radiation minds decay


Robot minds of robot slaves
Lead them to atomic graves
Plastic flowers, melting sun
Fading moon falls upon
Dying world of radiation,
Victims of man's frustration
Burning globe of obscene fire
Like electric funeral pyre

Buildings crashing down
To earth's cracking ground
Rivers turn to mud
Eyes melt into blood

Earth lies in deathbed
Clouds cry for the dead
Tearing falling rain
Ease the burning pain
Electric funeral

Electric funeral
Electric funeral
Electric funeral

And so in the sky
Shines the electric eye
Supernatural king
Takes earth under his wing
Heaven's golden chorus sings
Hell's angels flap their wings
Evil souls fall to hell
Ever trapped in burning cell!
