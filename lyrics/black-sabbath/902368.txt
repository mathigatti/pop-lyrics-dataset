Love in home
Runin' fast
In the eye of the storm


Cold wind blows
Victim of my past
Now my life is forlorn
All i know i know nothing at all
In the eye of the storm
I can feel i'm slippin' away
I belong in the eye of the storm

I'm

Cast my faith
My fortune my fame
On the force of the wind
Bet your life
On all my love
I can't see where i've been
All i know i know nothing at all
In the eye of the storm
I can feel i'm slippin' away
I belong in the eye of the storm

Now i know
Your lost in my love
When i look in your eyes
All for naught
It's nothin' at all
I can feel love arrive
I feel love
Alone on the storm
Cast adrift on the shore
I belong in the eye of the storm

I'm

The eye of the storm

The eye of the storm
