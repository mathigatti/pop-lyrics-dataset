I've been gone a long, long time, waiting for you
I din't want to see you go, oh no no
And now it's hurting so much,what can I do?
I wanted you to be my wife
The days are passing slowly,since you've gone
Your memories are all I have, yes i have
I sit here waiting but you'll never show
Without you I can't carry on
Uh, my baby


You said you'd always love me,all of my life
And then you said your last goodbye, yeah goodbye
Why the sudden change,why all the lies
I should have seen it in your eyes
The endless hours of heartache, waiting for you
My summer love has turned to rain, oh the pain
The silent emptiness of one sided love
My life means nothing now you're gone, uh my baby
