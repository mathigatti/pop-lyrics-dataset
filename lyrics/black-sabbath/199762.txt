It's a loaded dice, that you throw this time,
If you turn the Ace, it'll turn out fine,
When you spin the wheel, and you get your call,
South of the line, well the loser gets it all.


One too many days, one too many nights,
You cried too many tears, had too many fights,
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose.

God knows there's no good time.

Too many days, and too many nights,
You cried too many tears, had too many fights,
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose,
Yeah, yeah, Bad time to lose.
