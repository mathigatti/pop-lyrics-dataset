Visions cupped within the flower,
Deadly petals with strange power,
Faces shine a deadly smile,
Look upon you at your trial


Chill that numbs from head to toe,
Icy sun with frosty glow,
Words that go read to your sorrow,
Words that go read no tomorrow

Feel your spirit rise with the breeze,
Feel your body fallin' to its knees
Take your wall of remorse, takes your body to a corpse
Takes your body to a corpse takes your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse,
Takes your body to a corpse

Now from darkness there springs light,
Wall of sleep is cool and bright,
Wall of sleep is lying broken,
Sun shines in, you have awoken

Oh yeah!

Some people say my love can not be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal

Oh yeah!

Follow me now and you will not regret
Living the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'till the end of time

Your love for me has just got to be real,
Before you know the way I'm going to feel,
I'm going to feel,
I'm going to feel

Oh yeah!

Now I have you with me under my pow'r
Our love grows stronger now with ev'ry hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who i am
My name is lucifer, please take my hand

Oh yeah!

Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met

Your love for me has just got to be real,

I'm going to feel,
I'm going to feel

Oh yeah!

Our love grows stronger now with ev'ry hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is lucifer, please take my hand
