Take these bones
My spirit doesn't need them any longer
In the zone
Between the living and the dead
Take these eyes
'Cause I don't need to see another minute
Of this life
From which I'm hanging by a thread


Please let go
We'll maybe meet again in someone's vision
Who could know
If there's another one out there?
On my own
I'm crossing through the final resolution
Going home
Without a promise or a breath

We are of indecision
Too late to change your mind
Was it a superstition?
Your dime

In my time
I've tried but didn't find a real direction
Toe the line
On the periphery of life
Say goodbye
There's no escape from absolute conclusion
Life goes by
But memories remain the same
Remain the same
