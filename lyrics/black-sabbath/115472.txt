Across The Desert Of The Burning Dark, A
Darkness Which Illuminates You,
There's A Place You've Always Wanted To Be,
Whose Pleasures Always Did Escape You,
It's Always Been So Out Of Reach, Nothing, So Near
Ever Felt So Far
And Now It's Here Within Your Grasp, A Never
Ending Burning Says It All.


As You Drive Into The Darkness, In Front The Future
Behind You History
Caught Alone In The Dark Night, Do You Think
That's The Way It's Supposed To Be.
You Don't Believe Your Eyes, Cos All They See Is
Lies, Oh Yeah.

You Better Run From The Holy Man, The Eyes That
Will Are Set Uppon You,
Listen Not To Verse And Prayer, Song That Thrill
And Voices Tempt You
The Inner Flame Has Fear Of Death, Never, Has
Light Ever Seemed So Dark.
Pilgrims Of Sabbocracy, Hear The Hounds Of
Heaven, As They Bark

As You Drive Into The Darkness, In Front The Future
Behind You History
Caught Alone In The Dark Night, Do You Think
That's The Way It's Supposed To Be.
You Don't Believe Your Eyes, Cos All They See Is
Lies, Oh Yeah.

I Witness A Time And A Place That Never Dies, Still
Frozen In Time,
This Darkness The Only Place That I Can Hide, I
Witness, A Dream.

As You Drive Into The Darkness, In Front The Future
Behind You History
Caught Alone In The Dark Night, Do You Think
That's The Way It's Supposed To Be.
You Don't Believe Your Eyes, Cos All They See Is
Lies, Oh Yeah.

I Witness A Time And A Place That Never Dies, Still
Frozen In Time,
This Darkness The Only Place That I Can Hide, I
Witness A Dream.
Oh, Just A Dream.
