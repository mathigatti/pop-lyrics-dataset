This is no ordinary soul, that you're destroying,
Not just another life that drifts along with the sands of time.
We tried to show you on your way, but still, you cannot see,
You're hurting me you told too many lies and so it ends, yeah


You tried to touch me, but then i knew your plan,
You tried to take my world away, oh no,
Now i see it, it's as clear as day,
No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance.

You tried to lead me, to the land where you keep your lies,
But i've seen this read before, oh yeah,
There is no reason why i should listen now,
No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance.

So many people tried before, but still i came through stronger than before,
Someone like you will never get through my door no more,
Nothing you can do will hurt me, i am indestructible.
Nothing you can do will hurt me, i am indestructible. yeah.

Every lie that you tell you get closer,
Closer to the edge of the cauldron and in to the fire, yeah.
Every life you destroy will return, it will come back and haunt you,
For ever and ever.

Nothing you can do will hurt me, i am indestructible.
Nothing you can do will hurt me, i am indestructible. yeah.

This is no ordinary soul that you're destroying,
Not just another life that drifts along with the sands of time.
