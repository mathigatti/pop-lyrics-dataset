So you lie awake and think about tomorrow,
And you try to justify the things you've done,
But there's no one here, to hear your tears falling,
When you turn around, you find out, that you're the lonely one.


And it feels like someone's treading on your shadow,
And you always thought that heaven knows for sure,
And it feels like you're drowning, in your tears.

So i won't cry for you, no i ain't gonna cry for you,
And i ain't gonna lie for you, no i ain't gonna cry for you.
Ain't gonna cry for you.

So you lie awake and think about the sorrow,
Does it really still the fears in your mind,
And you try to realise the things you wanted,
But you take it all for granted and now it makes you blind.

And it feels like someone's treading on your shadow,
And you always thought that heaven knows for sure,
And it feels like you're drowning, in your tears.

So i ain't gonna cry for you, no i ain't gonna die for you,
And i ain't gonna lie for you, no i ain't gonna cry for you.
Ain't gonna cry

I ain't gonna cry for you, i ain't gonna cry.

So i ain't gonna cry for you, no i ain't gonna die for you,
No i ain't gonna lie for you, no i ain't gonna cry for you,
Ain't gonna cry, ain't gonna cry for you no more,
Ain't gonna die, i ain't gonna die for no more,
Ain't gonna lie, i ain't gonna lie for no more,

Ain't gonna cry, i ain't gonna cry for you no more.
