Sometimes I feel like I'm dying at dawn 
And sometimes I'm warm as fire 
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain 
And it goes over, and over, and over again 


Too many flames, with too much to burn 
And life's only made of paper 
Oh, how I need to be free of this pain 
But it goes over, and over, and over again 

Oh, sometimes I cry for the lost and alone 
And for their dreams that will all be ashes 
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain 
And it goes over, and over, and over again 

Over, and over, and over again 
Over, and over again 
Over, and over, and over again 
Over, and over again 
Over, and over, and over again 
Over, and over again 
Over, and over, and over again 
Over, and over again 
Over, and over, and over again
