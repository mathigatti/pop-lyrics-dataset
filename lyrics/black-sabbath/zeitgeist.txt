Astral engines in reverse
I'm falling through the universe again
Down among a dead mans vision
Faded dreams and nuclear fission span
The strings of theory are holding up the race
The puppets falling to the ground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found
On this sinking ship I travel
Faster than the speed of light
Not so supernova burns
The black holes turn and fade from sight
The strings of theory hide in the human race
The answers burried underground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found
And very soon
The boundless moon
Will show us light
And as we crash
We'll pray and kiss
And say good night
Good night
