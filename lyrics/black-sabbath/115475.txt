Thunder shattered the dawn 
Raging with fury, the king has come 
The power of terror will reign 
There is no mercy in pleading 


In for the kill, no quarter be shown 
Live for the thrill of battle alone 
Blessed by the will to die for the throne 
In for the kill 
In for the kill 

Freedom is taken by storm 
The blood on his hands is still running warm 
The power of terror will reign 
There is no mercy in pleading 

In for the kill, no quarter be shown 
Live for the thrill of battle alone 
Blessed by the will to die for the throne 
In for the kill 
For the kill 

Thunder shattered the dawn 
Raging with fury, the king has come 
Death and destruction riding the storm 
Blood on his hands still running warm 

In for the kill 
The king has come
