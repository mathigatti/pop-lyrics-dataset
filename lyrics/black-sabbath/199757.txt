Step back and look at you, and tell me that is what you want to be
You realise that what you're seeing, is a replica of me
Inside my world is pretty grim, that even I can't survive in
I wouldn't try 'cause I know you


Deep inside you know you're guilty as hell
Deep inside you know you're guilty as hell

You realise that what you're seeing is just a replica of me
Only me

Oh it makes no difference if you're the only one
It doesn't matter when all is said and done
Gonna feel the same, God will put the blame on you
Oh yeah

If I was you, if I was you
I'd wanna see, I'd wanna see inside my head
I'd wanna know if I was fuckin' dead
I'd wanna know what's going on
Someone tell me the truth

There's no fear in a fallen angel, there's no love in a heart made of stone
There's no truth in a heart that is screaming
Deep inside you're as guilty as hell
There's no fear in a fallen angel, there's no love in a heart made of stone
There's no truth in a heart that is screaming
Deep inside you're as guilty as hell
You're guilty
