No one said it had to be this way
Why are we the victims of their final word?
Dying world is killing us so slowly
I believe no God may save us now


Can't you see what I see?
Sinners, say your prayers tonight!
Your judgment day is here

Child of tomorrow will die, not even born
Jesus our questions, he never seems to hear
Dying for the answers may be
The price we pay

To find the key to our lives
Is there a heaven? Is there a hell?
Who's this God? Tell me, there's no God above, why?

We chose what lord
Deep within our souls, he's not one thing
Ooh, we are his spirit
We could save this world from destruction day!

Can't you see what I see? Can you hear me cryin'?
Oh, God can you help me now? Take my hand!
Oh, God take my hand

You and I are victims of their word
As the master of powers try to poison our world
Greed, money taken over their souls
Just mechanical brains, politicians don't know
They just don't know, know, know, know, just don't know!
