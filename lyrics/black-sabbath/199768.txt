What is it that turns you on to the illusion of power
This thing that grabs you by the heart and makes you want to tear things down
There is no reason why I should need all this power, but if you cross me now
I'm gonna tear your whole world down


The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real
The illusion of power

I can't get the emotional thing straight in my head
Everything I love dies too soon, or is already dead
Don't stand too close I spit and breathe fire
Anything I've got now you cannot desire

You want to be my friend, I promise you nothing
Nothing I can give you, nothing I can do for you
I'm being chased by the sins of my past and it's killing me now
Killing me now

The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real
The illusion of power
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed
The illusion of power

Fool, you're caught in a complex catacomb of your own inadequcies and pitiful weaknesses
Your soul secretes insecurity
So you live on the reflection side of the mirror; you're terrified of true power
You Fear

I can tell you stories of my
shaded past and I can drag you down into the depths of my soul

The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real
The illusion of power
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed
The illusion of power

Why don't you come closer, promise a story I will tell, yeah
I'll save you from your dreams, yeah
I'll save you from your dreams
