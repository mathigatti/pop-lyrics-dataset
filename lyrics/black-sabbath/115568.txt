Close my eyes starting dreaming 
See a vision filled with wings 
Head my way 
Feel the presence of unknown power 
Telling me to come 
This is the only way 


It's dream within dream 
Lost and lonely 
Don't get pulled by the devil's hand 

Silent screamer filled with fear 
As the night time shapes a face 
Then disappears 
Scared forever into believing 
That your mind has met the 
Prince of whom you see 

It's dream within dream 
Lost and lonely 
Don't get fooled by the 
Devil's hand 

It's dream within dream 
Fool forever, don't get fooled 
Forever 
Don't get fooled, be the devil 

In your eyes 
The evil spirit rises 
Blinded by the dark 
You fall into shame 
As the reaper takes you 
Down the spiral stairway 
You share the evil pit 
With satan's name 

Nightmare it's got me runnin' 
Nightmare it's calling you 
Nightmare it's got me runnin' 
Nightmare it's calling you 

It's dream within a dream 
Lost and lonely 
Don't get fooled, be the devil 

It's dream within a dream 
Lost forever 
Don't get fooled 

It's got me running 
It's just a nightmare 
It's got me running 
It's got me running
