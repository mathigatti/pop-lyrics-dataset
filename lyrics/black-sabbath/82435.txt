There's a place just south of Witches' Valley
Where they say the wind won't blow
And they only speak in whispers of her name


There's a lady they say who feeds the darkness
It eats right from her hand
With a crying shout, she'll search you out
And freeze you where you stand

Lady Evil, evil
She's a magical mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil in my mind
She's queen of the night, but alright, mmm-m

In a place just south of Witches' Valley
Where they say the rain won't fall
Thunder cracks the sky, it makes it bleed, yeah
There's a lady they say who needs the darkness
She can't face the light
With an awful shout, she'll find ya out
And have you before the night

Lady Evil, evil
She's a magical mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil on my mind
She's a queen of the night

So if you ever get to Witches' Valley
Don't dream or close your eyes
And never trust your shadow in the dark
'Cause there's a lady I know who takes your vision
And turns it all around
The things ya seen are what to be, lost and never found

Lady Evil, evil
She's a magical mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil on my mind
She's queen of the night
Gonna do you right
She's the queen of sin
Look out, she'll pull you in
Lady Wonder
