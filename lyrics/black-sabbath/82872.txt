Say you don't love me you'll burn
You can't refuse, but you lose it's by me
Say you don't love me, you'll learn
Nothing you do will be new 'cause I'm trough


Call me a liar, you knew
You were a fool, but that's cool, it's allright
Call me the devil, it's true
Some can't accept, but I crept inside you

So If a stranger calls you
Don't let him whisper his name, 'cause it's voodoo

Fade into shadow, you'll burn
Your fortune is free, I can see it's no good
Never look back, never turn
It's a question of time 'till your mind and you learn

So If a stranger sees you
Don't look in his eyes, 'cause he's voodoo

Say you don't love me you'll burn
You can't refuse, but you lose it's by me
Say you don't love me, you'll learn
Nothing you do will be new, 'cause I'm trough

Voodoo

Bring me your children, they'll burn
Never look back, never turn
Cry me a river, you'll learn...voodoo
