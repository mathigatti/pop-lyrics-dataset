There's a vision in the sands
Rising from the ancient past
Crying let my spirit go
Lead my burning soul to rest


Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star

There's no shelter from the heat
There's no mercy from this land
Hear a thousand chanting souls
Waiting judgement from God's hand

Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
Hear the sound of fallen angels
It's the call of the seventh star

The pyramids will fall
Turn to dust before the sun
And the star will rise again
Until destiny is done

Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
Hear the sound of fallen angels
It's the call of the seventh star
