I wish somebody would empty my head
I am so sorry for the things that I've said
This hopeless feeling that's living inside
I'm just a lonely soul who's trying to find
Some peace of mind


I ain't no hero who's gonna save you
I just say "hi" as I'm passing right through
I ain't that crazy, I'm only here for the ride
So please forgive me while I'm trying to find
Some peace of mind

Read in between the lines
Truth that is neither black nor white
Black nor white
Just give me something real
Broken man still searching for the light
In the night

Caught In the middle as the front line falls
It looks like I don't stand a chance
If only I could turn my life around
Or is this just the circumstance
