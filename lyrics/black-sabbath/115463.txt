Something About The Way That You Look At Me,
You Watch Every Move, Every Step, Every Fantasy,
Got No Time For Love, There's Something On Your Mind,
Got The Face Of An Angel But The Stare Of A Devil Inside.


I Got Hell Looking Up, Heaven Looking Down,
People Said The Woman's Got An Evil Eye.
I Got Hell Looking Up, Heaven's Looking Down,
Free Me From The Woman With The Evil Eye.

I Turn Away But Still I See That Evil Stare,
Trapped Inside My Dreams I Know You're There.
Thoughts Of Happiness You Destroyed Them All,
First Inside My Head, Then Inside My Soul.

I Got Hell Looking Up, Heaven Looking Down,
People Said The Woman's Got An Evil Eye.
I Got Hell Looking Up, Heaven's Looking Down,
Free Me From The Woman With The Evil Eye.
Evil Eye
Evil Eye
Evil Eye
Evil Eye
