Take me to the river baby drink my wine
When I'm going down won't you throw me a line?
Lead me to religion take me up them stairs
When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers?


When will you show me a sign?
When will you throw me a line?

Help me to the answer baby set me free
I'm torn between the devil and the deep blue sea
Maybe if you wanted you could save my face
Keep me out of trouble and I'm a living disgrace

When will you show me a sign?
When will you throw me a line?

Oh baby, call me on the hot line
Baby, call me on the hot line
The hot line's on fire

Show me to a sucker and you'll see my name
Standing in a line with the shadows of fame
Lead me to a legend take me up them stairs
When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers?

When will you show me a sign?
When will you throw me a line?

When will you show me a sign?
When will you throw me a line?

Oh, call me on the hot line
Yeah, call me on the hot line
Oh, the hot line baby, oh

Take me to the river baby, drink my wine
Take me to the river and drink my wine
Take me to the river, drink my wine
Take me, take me, take me, take me

Take me to the hot line
Baby, take me to the hot line
Take me to the hot line
To hot line
