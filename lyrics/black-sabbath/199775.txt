He saw the world, dim with the glow of the vertical sun
His skin crept cold knowing that this was the hours of dying
Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me
Spirit of man, cannot be freed.


When death calls - this is the hours of dying
When death calls - the spirit of man cannot be freed
When death calls - there's no tomorrow
When death calls - just an evil shadow

Tell me not fear of the flames means that heaven is closer
For i believe satan lives, in the souls of the dying
Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me
Spirit of man, cannot be freed.

When death calls - heaven is closer
When death calls - feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When death calls - here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
When death calls - you're gonna burn

Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister
Can't die until satan says you die
And satan takes your soul
In the face of death or your toungue will blister

Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister
Can't die until satan says you die
The devil takes your soul
With all his wrath he calls the reaper

When death calls - this is the hours of dying
When death calls - the spirit of man cannot be freed
When death calls - there's no tomorrow
When death calls - just an evil shadow
When death calls - feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When death calls - you're gonna burn, burn, burn
When death calls - heaven is closer
When death calls - i can feel it, gonna take you down
