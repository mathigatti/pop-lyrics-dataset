When i came down for the first hour
All of my problems had got a new form
You came to me clutching a flower
Talking of peace and keeping me warm


If you can believe in me
I will come for you
Instead of deceiving me
I want you, want you

When i came down for the next hour
All of my problems had got a new form
You walked away clutching your flower
Talking of peace and leaving me warm

If you can believe in me
I will come for you
Instead of deceiving me
I want you, want you

When i came down for the last hour
All of my problems had got a new form
She walked away clutching a flower
Talking of peace and leaving me warm
