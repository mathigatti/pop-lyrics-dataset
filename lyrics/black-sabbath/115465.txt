Livin' in the fast is easy till you run out of road
Friends will turn to strangers when you're out of control
A slip of the tongue when it's done, is often hard to see it through
So never let your words be lies or they'll come looking for you
It's a hard life to love


For the price of glory you left and threw your fortunes away
Never really cared too much for the job or the pay
You're standing in the rain with no cover but you never complain
You're an angry young man face to face but your mirror's insane
It's a hard life to love

I'm simply refusing a part in your world
'Cause I see, see how it burns
I see how it turns
And you're simply denying the fact that you're blind
And I see no more, I see red, I only see red

Think of all the times I was hurting but you felt no pain
Think of all the lies you told me again and again
And still you seek the truth from those who continue to lie
And now you're seeking life from those who are living to die
It's a hard life to love

I'm simply refusing a part in your world
'Cause I see, see how it burns
I see how it turns
And you're simply denying the fact that you're blind
And I see no more, I see red, I only see red

Livin' in the fast lane ain't easy when you run out of road
Friends will turn to strangers when there's nowhere to go
Don't give a damn when you're lost 'cause you'll die from it all
Laws were made to be broken and you do it for the thrill of it all
It's a hard life to love
It's a hard life to love
It's a hard life to love
