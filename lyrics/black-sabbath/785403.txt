Told you once about your friends and neighbours
They were always seeking but they'll never find it
It's alright, yes it's alright


Where to go and where to see
It's always been that way and it can never be
It's alright, yes it's alright

Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn
That it's alright, yes it's alright

It's alright, it's alright

Don't you know that it's so good for you?
You can be making love and see it all go through
But it's alright, yes, it's alright

So I told you once about your friends and neighbours
They were always seeking but they'll never find it
It's alright, yes it's alright
