What you gonna do?
Time's caught up with you
Now you wait your turn
You know there's no return


Take your written rules, you join the other fools
Turn to something new, now it's killing you

First it was the bomb, Vietnam Napalm
Disillusioning, you push the needle in

From life you escape, reality's that way
Colours in your mind satisfy your time

Oh you, you know you must be blind
To do something like this
To take a sweet that you don't know
You're giving death a kiss,
Poor little fool now

Your mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Don't stop to think now

You're having a good time baby
But that won't last
Your mind's all full of things
You're living too fast

Go, out enjoy yourself
Don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you
To stick the needle in, yeah

Now you know the scene
Your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer seeing life's reality

Push the needle in
Face death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin
Caused by deadly pin

Head starts spinning 'round
You fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave
Death's hands starts to weave

It's too late to turn
You don't want to learn
Price of life you cry
Now you're gonna die
