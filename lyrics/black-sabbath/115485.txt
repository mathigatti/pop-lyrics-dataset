All your life you've been slipping and sliding 
Trying to find a way 
Sun won't shine but now it's your time to pay 
There's no turning back as you look 
The hangman in the eye 


Now hell's just your death away 

It's too late to say you care 
When there's evil in your stare 
You say you're not to blame 
In your head voices mocking every prayer 

Remember the face you saw 
That once was you 
Spirit high there's no way that 
You could lose 
Give him rope they said 
As you look the hangman in the eye 
Now around your neck you feel 
The noose 

In your head voices mocking every prayer 
Now you're lost forever 

I'm burning with fire it's time to 
Leave or get out 
I'm burning in fire I can't take 
No more so get out 
I'm burning with fire the wheels of 
Steel will grind you 
Burning in fire this time 
You're lost forever 
Lost forever! 

There's an evil in your stare 
Lost forever! 
And hell's just a breath away 
You're lost forever 
And there's no way out you burn 
With fire it's time to get out 
Get out, get out 
And there's no way out 
Lost forever
