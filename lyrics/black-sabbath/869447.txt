I see the look of evil in your eyes
Woman filling me all full of lies
Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds
You will pass someone else's bitter seed


Evil woman don't you play your games with me
Evil woman don't you play your games with me 

Now I know just what you're looking for
You want me to claim this child you bore
Well you know that it must must not be
And you know the way it's got to be 

Evil woman don't you play your games with me
Evil woman don't you play your games with 

Evil woman don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me 

Wickedness lies in your poisoned lips
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip
Blackness sleeps on top of your slate bed
Don't you wish that you could see me dead 

Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
