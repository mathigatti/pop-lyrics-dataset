She came from the past
She was never meant to last
Her destiny was fatal
From the start


A messenger from hell
She cast a deadly spell
On all of those who dare
To cross her heart

Ain't no use in you trying to run
Fate has taken it's toll
Just one look and the damage is done
Burn your eyes
Turn your heart into stone

History foretold of a circle
Cast in gold
An evil seed of power
Sealed within

But fate has lent a hand
Destroyed the golden band
And freed her soul
To wash the land with sin

Ain't no use in you trying to run
Fate has taken it's toll
Just one look and the damage is done
Burn your eyes
Turn your heart into stone

She cast a deadly spell
She put a spell on you
She's got evil in her heart
Turn your heart into stone
Turn your heart into stone
