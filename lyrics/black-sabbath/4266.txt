Alright now!
Won't you listen?


When I first met you, didn't realize
I can't forget you or your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me watching you and you kind
Oh, yeah

I love you
Oh, you know it

My life was empty, forever on a down
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf though you can't hear
Oh, yeah!

Come on now, try it out

Straight people don't know what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world will love you sweet leaf
Oh, yeah, baby!

Come on now! Oh, yeah!
Try me out, baby!
Alright! Oh, yeah-ah!
I want you part of this sweet leaf!
Oh, yeah!
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, try me out
I love you, sweet leaf, oh
