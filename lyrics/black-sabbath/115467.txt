In the days of confusion 
You've turned angry and cold 
You say it's an ilusion 
There's no fire in your soul 


Say you don't love me 
Say you don't care 
But don't leave me standing here 

Your hear's like a wheel 
Just waiting to roll 
It's longing for freedom 
To get out on the road 

You're hungry for something 
That you may never find 
So many reasons 
Your love has made you blind 

You say you don't love me 
You say you don't care 
So don't leave me standing here 
Don't leave me standing here 

You say you don't love me 
You say you don't care 
Don't leave me 
Don't leave me standing here 

Life ain't been easy 
Full of passion and pain 
Told me no reason 
Why I was to blame 

Don't leave me standing 
Don't leave me standing 
Don't leave me standing 
On my own
