Tortured and twisted, he walks the streets alone 
People avoid him, they know the street's his own 
Cold blade of silver, his eyes they burn so wild 
Mean as a tiger, society's own child 


Go the tiger, burn in hate 
You know you have to, Johnny Blade 
He's the meanest guy around his town 
One look and he will cut you down 
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade 

Life has no meaning, and Death's his only friend 
Will fate surprise him, where will he meet his end? 
He feels so bitter, yes he's so full of hate 
To die in the gutter, I guess that's Johnny's fate 

Rivals all across the land 
He kills them with his knife in hand 
He's the meanest guy around his town 
One look and he will cut you down 
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade 
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade 

Well you know that Johnny's a spider 
And his web is the city at night 
He's a victim of modern frustration 
That's the reason he's so ready to fight 

He's the one that should be afraid 
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade? 

Oh he knows his future's decided 
And he ain't gonna change it, no way 
He was born to die in the gutter 
He'll keep fighting `till the end of his days 

Been alone all through his life 
His only friend is a switchblade knife 
He's the one who should be afraid 
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade? 

You fool the people 
Who's fooling who? 
It's time to listen 
Who's fool are you?
