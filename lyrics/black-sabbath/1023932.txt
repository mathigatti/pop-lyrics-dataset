Hello can you hear me
I might not be alone
Don't see anyone near me
But I just might go home again
Lets meet in the morning
I just can't speak tonight
This is more than a warning
Be silent till its light and then


You know I'll be there
Waiting for someone to believe me
Remembering it all
Make my flesh start to crawl
I've seen an ear in the wall

This time it could prove it
But you've heard this all before
Cry wolf and you're moving
To a special kind of danger zone
I need a witness
Somebody just like you
So bring an exorcist
A wizard and the Holy Ghost

You know I'll be there

Waiting for someone to believe me
Remembering it all
Make my flesh creep and crawl
I've seen an ear in the wall

One more reason one more time
Someone's searching through my mind
Now where am I suppose to go
Its not who you are its who you know
What's it gonna be
I knew you would answer
I'm the curiosity
You could miss a chance because
The fool might see reality
There it is in the corner
You must be going blind
What's wrong were you born before
Your god invented eyes
It's got to be there
Grinding away at my secrets
It's going so dark
And you can't see it all
I'll turn on some lights
So you're sure not to fall
It's next to the eye in the wall
