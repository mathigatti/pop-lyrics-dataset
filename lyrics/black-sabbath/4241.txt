Goin' home late last night
Suddenly I got a fright
Yeah, I looked through a window and suprise what I saw:
Fairy boots are dancin' with a dwarf
All right now!


Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Oh, right now!

Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Allright now!

So I went to the doctor to see what he would give me
He said, "Son, son, you've gone too far
'cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do"

Yeah!
