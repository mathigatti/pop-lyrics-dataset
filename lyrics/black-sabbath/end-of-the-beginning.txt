Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?


Reanimation of the sequence
Rewinds the future to the past
To find the source of the solution
The system has to be recast

Release your mind
Fast forward to the secrets of your code
Your life's on overload

Delete or save, the units that make you an entity
That's your identity

If you don't know
Which way to go
You may feel lost and confused
A second chance
Your time to lose

Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul
Transformed time and space beyond control
Rise up, resist and be the master of your fate
Don't look back live for today
Tomorrow is too late

You don't wanna be a robot ghost
Occupying inside the human host
Analyzed and cloned endlessly
Synthesized until they set you free

Alright okay alright
Till they set you free
Alright okay alright
Till they set you free

I don't see you
I don't wanna see you
