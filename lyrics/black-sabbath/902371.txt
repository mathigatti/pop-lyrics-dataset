Waited for love
Cold in the dark
Cryin at the door
Lovin the love
Crying for my love
Taken my love
Lovin the live



Oh i feel love yeah
Crying for love
The dead on the way
Taken my sun

Nother day
Feel i've been lone
Crying for pain
Feel i fall
Drown in the day
Feel i've died because of the dark
Let it go
Oh hmmm
Oh my love

Love in the day
Dark of the night
Been every corner
The love of my life
Taken my love
Shaken my soul
Lost in the night
The cold of the day
Crying for love
You trouble me

Taken my love
Blood is my curse
Oh my love
Try control
Oh my heart
Can not sit home
Feel my god
Tearin' my heart
Take my love
Hmm
Take my love
Oh
Yeah
Here we go
Love is standing for love
Here in my god
Driving love
Here in faith
Love was caught in my cloud
It was caught in my love to my heart

My soul

Loaded gun, draw my love
I give my heart
Take my love
I give my soul
Take my love
Take my heart
Yeah
Take my soul
Oh yeah
Take my whole oh yeah
Oh oo
Yeah
Take my heart
Ooo
Yes
