If I had to live again, I'ld change everything
'Cause everything I do, you know that I can't win.
Say it isn't right, but you say it isn't wrong.
How the Hell am I supposed to please everyone?


Tell me what it is that I'm supposed to do yeah
I ain't here for everybody, but I ain't here for you
You said it isn't right, but you said it isn't wrong.
Wish somebody could tell me, what it is that I've done wrong.

Best things in life aren't given, these things ain't for you and me.
Everytime you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.

You know it's gonna get you now,
And you know it starts to bring you down.

Tell me what it is, that I'm supposed to do yeah
I ain't here for everybody, but I ain't here for you
Seems I have to fight, for all the things I want
Wish somebody could tell me, what it is that I've done wrong.

Best things in life aren't given, these things ain't for you and me.
Everytime you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.
