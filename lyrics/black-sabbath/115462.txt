Can You Hear, The People Sing Their Song 
To Tunes Of Glory, They Move As One. 
Refugees Of Liberation Marching On, 
Sing Our Song, Rock The Nation, Write Of Wrongs. 


When You Take Of Life And Steal It's Shadow, All That's 
Left Is Humanity. 

It's Getting Closer, Change Is Bound To Come. 
Theres Someone Out There, Holding Candles To The 
Sun. 

Then An Answer, Says That Peace Will Come Around, 
Stand In Line, Take Our Time And Be Proud. 

Take A Life And Steal It's Shadow, All That's Left It's 
Humanity 
Take A Man And Steal Tomorrow, All That's Left Is You 
And Me. 

Here Them Call You, Soldiers All In The Fields Of Love, 
Brothers, Sisters, Children, All Dying For Love. 

Refugees Of Liberation, Marching On, 
Sing Your Song, Rock The Nation, Write Of Wrongs. 

Take A Life And Steal It's Shadow, All That's Left Is 
Humanity. 
Take A Man And Steal Tomorrow, All That's Left Is 
You And Me. 

Hear Them Call You, Soldiers All In The Fields Of Love, 
Brothers, Sisters, Children, All Dying For Love. 

Hear Them Call You, Dying For Love, Those Who Know 
You, Dying For Love, 
Brothers, Sisters, Dying For Love, Saints And Sinners, 
Dying For Love, 
Dying For Love.
