I'm just another back street kid
Rock 'n Roll music is the only thing I really dig
Can't stop the music going round inside my head
I'm a rock 'n roll soldier, gonna play it until I'm dead
Nobody I know will ever take my rock 'n roll away from me


Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine
Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been
Playing my music, sitting in my hotel room
Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom
Nobody I know will ever take my rock 'n roll away from me

Living life comes easy if you known whitch way you're going
Got to see yourself in others eyes, surprised?
Living live I want to don't come easy, but I'm tryng
Sorting out what's true and what are lies, it's wise

Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land
Seems that now my musics paying off my taxi demands
So listen to the music, want to see you getting so high
'Cos I'm a back street rocker and I will be 'till the day I die
Nobody I know will ever take my rock 'n roll away from me
