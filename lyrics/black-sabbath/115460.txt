She wears her leather just to satisfy 
she really throws it around 
There ain't one thing she can't afford to buy 
she's the richest bitch in town 


Her big fat daddy was a money machine 
he made a fortune from computers 
She's got more money than I've ever seen 
but she's a greedy emotional looter 

Keep away from the digital bitch 
Keep away from the digital bitch 
Keep away from the digital bitch 
She's so rich, the digital bitch 

She's got five rollers and a fine estate 
a big house up on the hill 
She throws parties just to celebrate 
her life is just one enormous thrill 

She buys poor people just to have around 
She has a trophy for each lover 
The bitch is rich but baby pound for pound 
she's got a lot more to discover 

Maybe she could please me if I saw beneath her veil 
But she's just an imitation woman up for sale 

She got so famous that she's on TV 
She's got a professional smile 
But I switch over 'cos she ain't for me 
She disturbs me all the while 

She looks so happy but she's got it wrong 
she's always going faster 
She sings her life to such a different song 
she needs a loving and dominant master
