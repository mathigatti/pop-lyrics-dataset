Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from another world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire wore a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah


We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter song, a sabbath ending
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air

In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has left me down
She brings broken dreams, falling stars
The endless search for where you are

Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

Now fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from another world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady
Desire wore a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah

Don't sail away on a crimson tide
Don't leave your heart on the other side
Her eyes were an endless flame
Desire wanna scratch your name

Don't ever fall in love
Don't give your heart away
Don't ever, never fall in love
With a country girl
