I'll play your game 
But if you lose you're gonna have to pay the price 
Broken chains, like a prisoner free at last 
The fear inside just up and died 
Time will tell if i am wrong 


It won't be too long 
You think I'm chasing shadows In the dark 
Well I'm not born to lose 
I'm not born to lose 

You curse my name, as you turn and walk away, from view 
It won't be too long 
You don't scare me cos you're 
Hard to see and it's time 
That you were gone 
It won't be too long 

You think I'm chasing shadows In the dark 
Well I'm not born to lose 

You think I'm chasing shadows In the dark 
What you gonna do about it now 
What you gonna do about it now 

It won't be too long 
It won't be too long 
It won't be too long 

You think I'm chasing shadows In the dark 
What you gonna do about it now 
What you gonna do about it now 

Ain't nothing I can do about it now
