I see it on the TV, it's playing on my mind,
Everything I see has got something to do with killing my brother.


Just another mind game? or maybe it's a sign,
When the child with a gun holds it up to the head of his brother.

Well that ain't nice. Gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life,
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip, yeah.

Somebody tell me, where did we lose?
Where's the point that we lost the control to live with each other?
Mister politician, searching for a lie.

What's the truth? will the youth find the proof for a revolution?

Cause that ain't nice, gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip, on ice,
Gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip

Gotta get a hold of the situation, gotta get you into my life,
Gotta get a hold and get it moving.
I can't tell you what you need to know it's up to you, oh yeah

That ain't nice, gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip, cause you're gonna slip, on ice,
Gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip.

Gotta get a hold of the situation, gotta get a hold on life,
Gotta get a grip and get it moving,
I can't tell you what you need to know, it's up to you, oh yeah.

Don't your blood run cold, don't the sorrow show, 
Hold on tight to what you have.
See it in your eyes, don't it make you cry,
Get a grip and shake the can.
Get a grip, yeah, get a grip, yeah, get a grip, yeah,
Get a grip, get a grip, get a grip, get a grip, get a hold.
Get a grip on life, get a grip on life, get a grip on life, 
Yeah get a grip.
