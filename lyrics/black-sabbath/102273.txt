Well i'm sick and tired of hearing 'bout the world and its hang ups
Gonna get myself together,
Take a ride downtown
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see him, see him today
He's gonna blow me away


He makes me happy when i'm feeling down
Take away my worry takes away my frown
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see him, see him today
He gonna blow me away

If you wanna feel groovy
Give the doctor a call
Doctor rock will help you anytime at all
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see him, see him today
He gonna blow me away
