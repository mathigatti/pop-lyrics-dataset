Fire and water, wind and rain
Wings that carry hell in every vein
World possessions, endless taers
Truth and knowledge stolen all their years


World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence stills the air and kills the chime
Words are poison, passion bleeds
2000 years on earth has sown the seeds

The time of dreams has turned
The night is gone and light shines on
Where darkness once would hide
With spirits high, our fears were born

Chorus:
Receiver of light, the kingdom of god will guide you
Keep you from a restless heart
Deceiver of night, the stranger that laughs
Within you, the reason for the restless heart
Is the keeper of the sabbath stones

Fire and water, wind and rain
Wings that carry hell in every vein
World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence stills the air and kills the chime

Can faith destroy desire? each breath a prayer
Each step brings fear
The eyes of they that see have evil stare
Watch over me

Chorus
And he's the keeper of the sabbath stones


What god is this that stands to hear his people cry?
What hand would strike and watch his people die?
What life that takes, what future did we earn?
It's our mistakes, take heed the sabbath stones

What life that takes what future did we earn?
It's our mistakes
