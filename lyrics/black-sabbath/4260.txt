Sorcerers of madness
Selling me their time
Child of God sleeping in the sun
Giving peace of mind
Fictional seduction
On a black snow sky
Sadness kills the superman
Even fathers cry


Of all the things I value most of all
I look inside myself
And see my world
And know that it is good

You know that I should

Superstitious century
Didn't time go slow
Separating sanity
Watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker
Spiral sky
Silver ships on plasmic oceans
In disguise

Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories
And feel their warmth
And know that they are good

You know that I should

Watching eyes of celluloid
Tell you how to live
Metaphoric motor replay
Give, give, give
Laughter kissing love is showing
Me the way
Spiral city architect
I build you pay

Of all the things I value most of all
I look upon my earth
And feel the warmth
And know that it is good

You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
