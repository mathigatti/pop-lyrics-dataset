Born in the window 
Cold blooded spoof 
Raised in the prison 
You called the school 
Taught young in legends 
Told what to do 
I handed my childhood 
Over to you 


Travelling endlessly, I'm searching for mind 
I'm almost afraid of what I will find 
Wandering aimlessly, oh what can I do? 
I handed my future over to you, to you 

Over to you 
Future looks blue 
What can I do? 

Watching for freedom 
Fighting our wars 
Feeding our children 
Keeping your laws 
Someday you'll suffer 
And what I'll do 
I'll hand all your promises 
Over to you 

Standing inside myself, I'm losing control 
You made me believe in the stories you told 
Waiting impatiently, what else can I do? 
I handed my future over to you, to you 

Over to you 
Future looks blue 
What can I do? 

Tears filled of sadness 
Stealing myself 
Which burning secrets? 
What to they tell? 
Mad politicians 
Can tell it true 
I handed my children 
Over to you 

All over, over to you 
All over, over to you 
All over, over to you...
