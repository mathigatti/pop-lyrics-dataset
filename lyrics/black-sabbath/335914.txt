There is no warning, there is no time
No resurrection to save mankind
There are no visions, no paradise
No superstition, no afterlife


We just fade to black…you just fade to black…

Won't be no future, won't be no pain
Won't be no Satan, no one to blame
No children growing, no getting old
No one is dying, no stories told

We just fade to black…we just fade to black… we just fade to black… we just fade to black…

You can't find tomorrow, you can't touch today
You don't feel no love, you're driving me insane

I just can't wake from this scary dream
I'm locked inside for eternity
I can't awake from this scary dream
I can't escape from this scarry dream

I just can't wake from this scary dream
I'm locked inside for eternity
I just can't wake from this scary dream
I can't escape from this scary dream
