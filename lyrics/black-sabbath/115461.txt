Let's try getting to the sky, hang on or you're going to die 
Sour life can turn sweet, it's laying at your feet 
Sweet child with an innocent smile watches closely all the while 
Don't be fooled when he cries, keep looking at the eyes 


Good life is contradiction because of the crucifixion 
If you're ready and have the need, 
I will take your soul and plant my seed 

You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day 
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away 
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel 
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal 
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up the stairs 
You just gotta listen to the night 
and don't forget to say your prayers 
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise 
And icy fingers send electric lies 

We're disturbing the priest, won't you please come to our feast 
Do we mind disturbing the priest, 
not at all, not at all, not in the least 
ahhhh, Do we mind disturbing the priest 
aahhhh, not at all, not at all, not in the least 

The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face 
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace 
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set alight 
The flames of doubt so deep inside inside 
The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away 
It's just like the battle of the sun and the moon and night and day 
The force of the devil, that's we're all told to fear 
Watch out for religion when he gets too near too near 

We're disturbing the priest, won't you please come to our feast 
Do we mind disturbing the priest, 
not at all, not at all, not in the least 

Good life is contradiction because of the crucifixion 
If you're ready and have the need, 
I will take your soul and plant my seed 

aahhhh, ahhhh, ah ha ha ha haaa! 

Let's try getting to the sky, hang on or you're going to die 
Sour life can turn sweet, it's laying at your feet 
Sweet child with an innocent smile watches closely all the while 
Don't be fooled when he cries, keep looking at the eyes 
Oh, disturbing the priest!
