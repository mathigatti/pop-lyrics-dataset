How people look and people stare
Well I don't think that I even care
You rot your life away and what do they give?
You're only killing yourself to live
Killing Yourself To Live!
Killing Yourself To Live!


Just take a look around you, what do you see?
Pain, suffering, and misery
It's not the way the world was planned
It's a pity you don't understand
Killing Yourself To Live!
Killing Yourself To Live!

I'm telling you!
Believe in me!
Nobody else will tell you
Open your eyes!
And see the lies!
Oh, yeah!

Smoke it!
Get high!

You think that I'm crazy and baby I know that it's true
Before that you knew it I think that you go crazy too

I don't know if I'm up or down
Well the black and whites are blue and brown
The colors in my life are all different somehow
Little boy blue's a big girl now

So you think it's me who's strange
But you've never had to make the change
Never give your trust away
You'll end up in paying till your dying day
