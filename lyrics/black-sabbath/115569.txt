Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight 
The silence is over, he's shattered the night 
No other hunter has the power or the grace 
He is the master of this place 


Tell every creature of the night 
The kill is around the bend 
So listen my friend 
Nightwing flies again 

They say he comes for those whose souls are weak 
and call his name upon the wind 
The night is cold and thick with mystery 
Oh I can feel his beating wings 

Tell every creature of the night 
The kill is around the bend 
Nightwing flies again 

Tell every creature of the night 
The kill is around the bend 
Nightwing flies again 

Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight 
The silence is over, he's shattered the night 
Life ain't for giving and forgiving ain't free 
No soul will rest while the hunted run free 

So Tell every creature of the night 
The kill is around the bend 
listen my friend 
Nightwing flies again
