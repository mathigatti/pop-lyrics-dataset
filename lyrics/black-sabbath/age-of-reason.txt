Do you hear the thunder
Raging in the sky?
Premonition of
A shattered world that's gonna die


In the age of reason
How do we survive?
The protocols of evil
Ravaging so many lives?

Mystifying silence
Talking peace on earth
We should judge each other
For ourselves not what we're worth

Sustainable extinction
A fractured human race
A jaded revolution
Disappears without a trace

Always felt that there'd be trouble
Mass distraction hides the truth
Prozac days and sleepless hours
Seeds of change that don't bear fruit

These time are heavy
And you're all alone
The battle's over
But the war goes on

Politics, religion
Love of money too
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you
