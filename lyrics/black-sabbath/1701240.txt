The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack


Your mamma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror and tell me do you think your life's in danger, yeah

(4x)
No more tears

Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin

I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

(4x)
No more tears

It's just a sign of the times
Going forward in reverse
Still
He who laughs last
Is just a hand in the bush

So now that it's over can we just say goodbye?
I'd like, I'd like
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold I don't know what else to say

I never wanted it to end this way my love, my darling
Believe me when I say to you in love I think I'm falling here

(4x)
No more tears

Is just a hand in the bush
