Can you see me, can you hear me
Can you hear me crying out for life?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over you'll find the answer
Running in the wispering rain
Anno mundi? Can you wonder!
Truth or thunder, life or blame


Do you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?
There are people laughing
They're all laughing at you
If only they could see what you're saying is true
Still generals fighting, making war on the worlds
Don't they know, don't they know?
No, no, no

The winds in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
As the sands of our time grow old
Anno mundi

Do you follow the path that so many trend?
Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?
Depends on another to fight it alone

Can you see me now, can you hear me now?
Can you tell me where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over, you'll find the answer
Runnin' in the rain

There's a hope that's growing and a vision too
All those angry hearts reach out for you
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?
No longer the fool, the vision is done
