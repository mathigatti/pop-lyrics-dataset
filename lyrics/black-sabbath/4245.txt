If there isn't light where no-one sees
Then how can I know what you might believe?


A story told that can't be real
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel

Fade away, fade away
Vanish into small
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball

Oh it's the sign, feels like the time

On a small world west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere, all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
If an echo doesn't answer when it hears a searchin' sound
Then the beast is free to wonder, but never seen around

And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross, all right!

Sail away, to the sign!

From the book the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten sound
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong

Reach above your dreams of pleasure
Give a knife to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
Sail the ship of sighs

And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross

Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball
Fade away, fade away
I can't accept it... anymore

On a real world west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere, all
There's a rainbow, see it shimmer
When the summer falls

From the book the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten sound
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong

It's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross

Don't live for pleasure
Make live your treasure
Fade away!

Eight miles high, about to fall
And no one there to catch you
Look for the sign...the time...
The Sign of the Southern Cross

Play on!
