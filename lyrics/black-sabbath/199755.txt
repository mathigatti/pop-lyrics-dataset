The chapter is opened and the pages are turned
The writings say many things, but who was concerned
Where can we run to now, when will we learn?
When it's lost, it's gone forever


For years they told me what I should do
Down to the places I go and who I should talk to
But that don't matter no more since I found out the truth
And it feels good to me, yeah

The world is turnin', Forever turnin'
Forever yearnin' For the love of life
and you're wrong if you think that I'm afraid to love

It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
It feels good to me

I wonder, I wonder does it not seem strange to you
Just how the tables have turned on me and you?
How long can we go on livin', livin' the way we do?
When it's lost it's gone forever

The world is turnin', Forever turnin'
Forever yearnin' for the love of life
And you're wrong if you think that I'm afraid to love

It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
It feels good to me

It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
It feels good to me

How long do we go on livin'?
Livin' the way we do, yeah

It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good

If I never saw another night
And I never saw another night
And I never saw another day
It still feels good to me
