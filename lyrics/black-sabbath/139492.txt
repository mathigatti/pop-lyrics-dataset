The way I feel is the way I am
I wish I'd walked before I started to run to you
Just to you


What kind of people do you think we are?
Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you
Just for you

The faithful image of another man
The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you
Yeah for you

The shot troopers lying down on the floor
I wish they'd put an end
To my running war with you
Yeah with you

Are you metal, are you man?
You've changed in life since you began
Yeah began

Ladies digging gold from you
Will they still dig now you're through?
Yeah you're through

You bought and sold me with your lying words
The voices in the deck
That you never heard came through
Yeah came through

Your folly finally got to spend with a gun
A poisoned father who has poisoned his son
That's you yeah that's you

I beg you please don't let it get any worse
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you
Yeah curse you

All of the promises that never came true
You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true
Ah, that's true

Are you satan, are you man?
You've changed in life since it began
It began

Vultures sucking gold from you
Will they still suck now you're through?

(Cats, rats)

The search is on, so you just better run
And find yourself another way
Probably dead, they don't feel a thing
To keep them living for another day

(Rats, rat)

You are nonentity you have no destiny
You are a victim of a thing unknown
A mantle picture of a stolen soul
A fornication of your golden throne

A smiling face, it means the world to me
So tired of sadness and of misery

My life it started some time ago
Where it will end, I don't know
I thought I was so good
I thought I was fine
I feel my world is out of time

But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I think I'll lose my mind

I know, I know, I know, yeah yeah I know
Listen to me while I sing this song
You might just think the words are wrong
Too many people advising me
But they don't know what my eyes see

But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I think I'll blow my mind
