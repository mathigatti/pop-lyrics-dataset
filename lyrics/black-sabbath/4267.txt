Well I don't want no jesus' freak to tell me what it's all about
No black magicians telling me to cast my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door now, my mind has been released


Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the God in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life, I don't want people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true

Every day just comes and goes
Life is one long overdose
People try to rule the nation
I just see through their frustation

People hiding their real faces
Keep on running their rat race
Behind each flower there grows a weed
In their world of make-believe

So believe what I tell you, it's the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself, you know you really shouldn't have to pretend
Don't let those empty people try and interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind
