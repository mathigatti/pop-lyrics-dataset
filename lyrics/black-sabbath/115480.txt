There's something wrong there's a chill in the air 
and the blood in my vein's running colder 
The eastern sky is beginning to silver 
and the words that you speak start to falter 
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed 
In the house of the dead there's a taker 
Some say that this is the ultimate sin 
When the spirit world turns to the alter 


There's been a kill in the spirit world 
There's been a kill in the spirit world 

Behold the dead clutching at fading hands, out of reach forever 
"In glory die" calls the voice of the void 
Your assassin has cursed every spectre 
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed 
and the house of the dead seeks a master 
Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end 
and a kiss on the wind whispers murder, Murder 

There's been a kill in the spirit world 
There's been a kill in the spirit world 

When heaven is closer, it's pleasure and pain 
Kill in the spirit world 

Did you see another in black 
is the blood in your veins running colder 
If you did then there's no turning back 
As the spirit world turns to the alter 
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed 
and the house of the dead seeks the master 
Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end 
and a kiss on the wind whispers murder, Murder 

There's been a kill in the spirit world 
There's been a kill in the spirit world 
Oh here it comes, oh no 

The seal is broken, The eastern sky is beginning to silver 
There's something wrong, there's a chill in the air 
I feel the evil, I feel the evil 
Somebody whispers murder 

A kiss on the wind whispers murder
