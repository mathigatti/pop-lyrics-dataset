Old men crying, young men dying
World still turns as Father Time looks on, on and on
Children playing, dreamers praying
Laughter turns to tear as love has gone, has it gone?


Oh, it's a hard road
Oh, it's a hard road

Whirlwind churning, lovers learning
On this path of life we can't back down, is it wrong?
Widows weeping, babies sleeping
Life becomes the singer and the song, sing along

Oh, it's a hard road
Carry your own load

Why make the hard road?
Why can't we be friends?
No need to hurry
We'll meet in the end

Why make the hard road?
Why can't we be friends?
No need to worry
Let's sing it again

Brother's sharing, mother's caring
Nightime falling victim to the dawn, shadows small
Days are crawling, time is calling
To the Earth that not that life has gone, love line drawn

Oh, it's a hard road
Carry your own load
Oh, it's a hard road
Oh, it's a hard road

Forget all your sorrow, don't live in the past
And look to the future, 'cause life goes too fast, you know
Forget all your sorrow, don't live in the past
And look to the future, 'cause life goes too fast, you know
