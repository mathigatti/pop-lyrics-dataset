Oh, slipping away 
Just a heartbeat from disaster 
Nothing could make me stay 
Close your eyes and I'll be gone 
Turn the page, yeah 
Time to start another story 
Slipping away, slipping away 
Time to move along 
No reason to stay 
 
Oh, when I'm slipping away 
Take a look at yourself 
You've been running in a circle 
Round and round you go 
You're a start without an end 
Start a new life, yeah 
From the city of the gypsies 
Breaking away, slipping away 
Right behind the clown 


Slipping away 
Slipping away 
Nobody to pay 
Look out, 'cause I'm slipping away 
 
Rocking the glass 
I won't leave you my reflection 
A future without a past 
No more road to take me back 
Come if you will, yeah 
Just don't question my direction 
Breaking away, slipping away 
We can find the sun 
 
Slipping away 
Slipping away 
Got nobody to pay 
So, and you're slippin' away 
No more running in a circle 
It's time to move along 
Round, round, round we go 
A start without an end 
So I'm slipping away 
Slipping away
