She sits in silence, in her midnight world 
Her faded pictures, of her dancing girls 
Her, distant dreamer, on the seas of time 
Her happy memories, dancing through her mind 


In days of romance 
She was the queen of dance 
She'd dance the night away 

And as the seasons turn the days to years 
She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers 
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen 
And now she dances only in her dreams 

In days of romance 
She was the queen of dance 
She'd dance the night away, away, away, away
