A rumble of thunder
I'm suddenly younger
It's your spell
No rhyme or reason
A turn of the season
Know it full well


The tongue can't deliver
I shake and I shiver down your soul
You know what you cover
I see for another it's a story told
So get a good hold...yeah !

A whistle of voodoo
You though that you knew who you are
A sep'rate equation
A pencil relation
The past gone too far
A time of suspicion
A special condition that we all know
So let it all go...yeah !

Turn up the night
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
It feels so right

Night time sorrow
Taken like the plane
Black will never come out
Lies for the same
Evil lurks at twilight
Dances in the dark
Makes you need the movement
Like a fire needs a spark to burn!

A rumble of thunder
I'm suddenly younger
It's your spell
No rhyme or reason
A turn of the season
Know it full well

The tongue can't deliver
I shake and I shiver down your soul
So get a good hold..yeah !

Turn up the night
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
It feels so right

Got to turn up the night
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
It feels so right

Turn up the night
Turn up the night
Get on the light
Turn up the night

It fells right
Turn up the night
It feels right
Shut out the light

Turn up the night
Turn up the night
