No one told me the way I should feel 
You left an aching heart 
Lost and lonely, the feeling goes on 
You were the one friend I had 
You gave me so much love 
Now the tears remind me you're gone 


It still haunts me there's a silence 
Where you used to be 
It still haunts me 
Just an empty space in history 
It still haunts me 
But life must go on, on and on 

It's still haunting me 
It's still haunting me 
Haunting me 
Haunting me
