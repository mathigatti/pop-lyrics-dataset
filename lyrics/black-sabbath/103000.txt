Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream 
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no 
Then think of a rainbow and I'll make it come real 
Roll me, I'm a never ending wheel 


I'll give you a star 
So you know just where you are 
Don't you know that I might be? 
Your wishing well 
Your wishing well 

Look in the water, tell me what do you see 
Reflections of the love you give to me 
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy 
So let me fill myself 
With tears you cry, why? 

Time is a never-ending journey 
Love is a never-ending smile 
Give me a sign to build a dream on 
Dream on... 

Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream 
You find that life's not always what it seems 
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy 
So let me fill myself 
With tears you cry 

I'll give you a star 
So you know just where you are 
Someday, some way 
You'll feel the things I say 
Dream for a while 
Of the things that make you smile 
'Cause you know 
Don't you know 
Oh, you know 
That I'm your wishing well 
Your wishing well 
Your wishing well 
I wish you well 
I'm your wishing well
