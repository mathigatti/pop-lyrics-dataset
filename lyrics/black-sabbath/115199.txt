Junior's eyes looked up to the skies in tears
He prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would 'pear
Junior sighed, as his hands reached out to the sky
Junior cried, the day that his best friend died
Yeah!


They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye

Junior's eyes, they couldn't disguise the pain
His father was leaving, and Junior's grieving again
Innocent eyes watched the man who had gave everything
Junior's sorrow, who knew what tomorrow would bring?
Yeah!

They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye

Junior's eyes looked into the skies once more
Now he knew well, this life was hell for sure
He desperately tried, his fingertips stretched to the stars, yeah
Reaching for reason, along with the time and the stars
Yeah!

They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye
