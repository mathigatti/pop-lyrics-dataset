Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time


All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me?
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah

I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

Make a joke, and I will sigh
And you will laugh, and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal

And so, as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could
But it's too late
