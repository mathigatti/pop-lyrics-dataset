I've seen a look of evil in your eyes
You've been filling me all full of lies
Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds
Do well best, someone else has better seen


Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

Now I know just what you're looking for
You want me to claim that child you bore
Well you know that it must he not be
And you know the way it got to be

Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with

Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

Wickedness lies in your moisten lips
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip
Blackness sleeps on top of your stray bed
Do you whish that you could see me dead

Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
