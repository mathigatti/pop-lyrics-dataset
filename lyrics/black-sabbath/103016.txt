Close the city and tell the people
That something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to
Take a bite from the wall


You've nothing to say
They'll drag you away
If you listen to fools
The mob rules

The mob rules

Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded
The end is always the same
Play with fire, you'll burn your fingers and
You'll get a hold of a flame, oh

It's over, it's done
The end has begun
If you listen to fools
The mob rules!

You've nothing to say
Oh they'll drag you away
If you listen to fools

Break the circle and stop the movement
The wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might stop rolling and
Take you right back around

You're all fools!
The mob rules!
