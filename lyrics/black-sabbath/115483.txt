Well it's a cold world 
And I'm in the middle 
Caught in the in-between 


I don't belong here 
So I'm writing to you 
It's wrong here 
Where I'm sending you some 

Chorus: 
Letters from earth, yeah 

Well it's a new world 
And now I'm a stranger 
Stranger than you know 

I don't belong here 
And I'm writing to you 
With blood on my hands 

What if I send you madness 
What if I send you pain 
And letters from earth, ooh 
All right 

Come on it's another game 
But you gotta play on 
Cause they say it's just pretend 
Ask them why they say you'll never, never die 
Come on - the game is called the end 

Well it's a cold world 
And I'm in the middle 
Caught in the in-between 

I don't belong here 
So I'm writing to you 
Hey let me explain 

What if I send you confusion 
What is the time and the pain worth 
Oh no no 
I'm only sending - 
Letters from the earth 

Letters from earth, ...
