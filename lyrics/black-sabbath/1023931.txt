Oh it's night again
And the dark just killed the sun
If the light must end
You've got time to run away


There's a door to dreams
And it always lets you in
But with a silent scream
All the nightmares must begin

Still you chase what you can't see
Like death and pain and sin
And the Shadow of The Wind
The Shadow of The Wind

You'll remember me
I could make you disappear
Be where you want to be
Just as long as it's not here

Well I'm back and stronger
And the first one's always free
And it lasts much longer

You can bet your sanity

Never more the victim cries
As I slip beneath the skin
Like the Shadow of The Wind
The Shadow of The Wind

If words had names like red and green
And two for sympathy
Black and white and in between
Then you'd be misery

Every day is an inquisition
Who are you? What are you? Why?
I'm alive, I belong, I'll be back
It's a half truth, still a whole lie

In the garden of good and evil
You'll come, but you know
The spider only spins
The Shadow of The Wind
The Shadow of The Wind
