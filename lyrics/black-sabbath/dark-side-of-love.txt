Dark side of love
Promise my all (?)
Now that you're gone
I'm broken apart
I'll take my place


The dark side of love
Gave you my heart
You warmed my soul
How can I???/
That's it my fate
Destiny call

The dark side of love
It's taking it's call
Making my heart
Losing control
I'll make my way
Alone in the cold
On the dark side of love
Dark side of love

Deep in the pain
Shadows again
Setting my soul
Darkness way

The dark side of love
It's making it's call
Making my heart
Losing control
I'll make my way
Alone in the cold
On the dark side of love
On the dark side of love

The dark side of love
It's making it's call
Making my heart
Losing control
I'll make my way
Alone in the cold
On the dark side of love
