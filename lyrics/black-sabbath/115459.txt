Silence is mocking the dawn of a new day 
Devil and Daughter are both on their way 
The evil of her nature collects in her eyes 
With him there's no fear of the dawn bringing light 


Baptised with fire, too wild to be tamed 
She's hot, evil and ready to take any man 
Let no one put assunder the power of the pain 
He is the master of hell riding again 

Devil and Daughter - pleasure and pain 
Devil and Daughter - is this the end 

A thousand times over, you'll hear on the wind 
in the name of hell, these sinners never sinned 
But Satan never listens to the words that they send 
Drenching the soul with blood, when will it end 

Devil and Daughter 
he's got the power, she's got the pain 
Devil and Daughter 
She'll break any woman and take any man 
Devil and Daughter 
Hand in hand with the reaper
