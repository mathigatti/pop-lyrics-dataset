Once upon a nightmare 
Once upon a time 
You're running from temptation 
You got lost 
And found that you don't 


Belong to anybody 
You're all the same 
Just another number 
Cross it out 
Whenever you don't behave 

Someone got the doctor 
He knows what to do 
Throw some bones and mumble 
The devil's inside of you 

It might be contagious 
It might change the plan 
Get back in your tiny boxes 
Even if you can't 
We say you can 

Join the congregation 
Everybody's got to get in line and 
We never justify 
The choir sings a never-ending lie 

When you thought you were free 
You didn't need a reason 
No reason to survive 

As the big door closes 
And you waiting for the nail 
Somebody tell the world 
You're buried alive 

Once upon a nightmare 
Once upon a time 
You're running from tomorrow 
You got lost 
And found that another 
Day has turned to ashes 
Taken by the wind 
Frozen seeds of sorrow 
Never to begin 

Join the celebration 
And everybody's got to get in line and 
We never justify 
The choir sings a never-ending lie 

When you thought you were free 
You did not need a reason 
No reason to survive 

As the big door closes 
And you waiting for the mail 
Somebody tell the world 
You're buried alive 

One more nightmare 
Just one more time 
Join the congregation 
Everybody get in line 

Celebration 
The choir sings a lie 
As you call 
The hammer falls 
And no one hears you cry 
I'm buried alive
