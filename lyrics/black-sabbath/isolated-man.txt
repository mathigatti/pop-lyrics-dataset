I like being alone
I'd like to stay in my room all day and night
Don't like to talk on the phone
So please forgive me while I just turn off the light


Don't wanna see nobody
Ever and ever again
Don't you feel sorry?
I'm just a crazy, isolated man

I know me better than you
I hate to hear another persons screaming voice
What are you trying to do?
Leave me alone!
I won't be anymore in cries

Don't wanna see nobody
Ever and ever again
I'm not in any hurry
I'm just a crazy, isolated man

Why don't you leave me alone?
'Cause there's nothing more I wanna say!
Thank you for caring but I'll be alright
Now will you understand and go away!?
Don't have a problem living in my room because it's where I really wanna be
So please forgive me if you think I'm strange but I just wanna spend my life with me!

Don't wanna see nobody
Ever and ever again
Don't you feel sorry?
I'm just a crazy, isolated man

Don't wanna see nobody
Ever and ever again
I'm not in any hurry
I'm just a crazy, isolated man
