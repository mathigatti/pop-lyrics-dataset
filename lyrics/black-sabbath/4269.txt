Take me through the centuries to supersonic years
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears
All I have to give you is a love that never dies
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes
Yeah! Yeah!


Mother Moon, she’s calling me back to her silver womb
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb
Seventh Advent unicorn is waiting in the skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah! Yeah!

Take my hand, my child of love, come step inside my tears
Swim the magic ocean I’ve been crying all these years
With our love, we’ll ride away into eternal skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah! Yeah!

Woman child of love’s creation
Come and step inside my dreams
In your eyes, I see no sadness
You are all that loving means
Take my hand, and we’ll go riding
Through the sunshine from above
We’ll find happiness together
In the summer skies of love
