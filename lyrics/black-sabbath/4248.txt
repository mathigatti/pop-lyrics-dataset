I feel unhappy
I feel so sad
I've lost the best friend
That I ever had
She was my woman
I love her so
But it's too late now
I've let her go


I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

We shared the years
We shared each day
In love together
We found a way
But soon the world
Had its evil way
My heart was blinded
Love went astray

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

It took so long
To realize
And I can still hear
Her last goodbyes
Now all my days
Are filled with tears
Wish I could go back
And change these years

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
