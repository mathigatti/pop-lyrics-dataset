Lord she's handsome 
As she flows across the floor 
Nothing I've seen in my life 
Has ever pleased me more 
She's got the look of freedom 
And it makes you think she's wild 
But I can see right through it all 
It's the way to have a child 


Oh, walk away 
She's looking to love you 
There's nothing to say 
Just turn your head and walk away 
Walk away, walk on 

She moves in sunlight 
Never seen the night at all 
Like a star in the midnight sky 
Burns before it falls 
I've never been lonely 
And I can't imagine why 
Maybe she could be the one to tell me 
I guess it's do or die 

Can't see her fire 
But I can feel her heat, all right! 
It's rising higher 
I'm walking the wire 

Walk on by! 

Oh! Walk away! 
She's looking to love you 
There's nothing to say 
Just turn your head and walk away 
Oh, walk on by, walk away! 
Walk on! 

You'll feel her fire, she'll lift you higher 
But don't be fooled! 
Just turn your head and walk away!
