Midnight, something don't feel right 
It's been too much, too far away from home 
Hard life, living the hard life 
I can't resist, I'm falling 
To the danger zone 


All day long I'm pushed and shoved 
I just can't get enough 
In the danger zone 

Red light, don't stop for no red light 
You know I'm always trouble on my own 
Lonely, ever so lonely 
I've got too much time 
I'm heading for the danger zone 

All day long I'm pushed and shoved 
I just can't get enough 
In the danger zone 

I'm eager, eager to please 
I can't stand no more 
It's got me on my knees 

Ain't gonna feel no hurt 
Ain't gonna feel no pain 
I got nothin' left to lose 
I ain't got no shame 
Don't try to stop me 
Just leave me on my own 
I'm gonna live or die 
In the danger zone 
I'm living in the danger zone 
In the danger zone 
Hard life, I'm living the hard life 
I'm gonna take a chance 
In the danger zone 
Lonely, ever so lonely 
I'm gonna live or die 
In the danger zone4 
Midnight, can't wait until midnight 
Help e I'm falling to the danger zone
