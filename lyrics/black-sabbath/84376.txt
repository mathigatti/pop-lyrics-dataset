Precious cups within the flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Back up on you at your trial


Chill and numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Why'd you go reaching your sorrow?
Why'd you go read no tomorrow?

Feel your spirit rise with the priest
Feel your body falling to its knees
Take your walk of remorse
Take your body to a corpse
Take your body to a corpse
Take your body to a corpse
If you want all remorse
Take your body to a corpse

Now from darkness, there springs light
Wall of Sleep is cool and bright
Wall of Sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you are awoken
