Reach out and take for me, fruit of the poison tree
Give me your body and your soul
My youth is fading fast, years melt into the past
This mortal life will take its toll


I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so amusing
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in

This spark of nature's fire, my only one desire
This world is hanging by a thread

I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so amusing
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in

People always tried to change me, alter everything I am
So many faces starin' in on me, you left me in the state I'm in
Virtual death

You may think this existence is just a human weakness
Inside my mind it's near the end

Virtual death

I'm losing, I'm fading fast
I'm dying, virtual death
I'm floating, I'm fading fast
I'm dying, virtual death
