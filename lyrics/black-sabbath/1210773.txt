I'm turning around and around
I'm falling down and there is no sound
I said fear grips my mind
Tears will make me blind


I'm trapped in a falling dream
Alone with a silent scream
Tumbling through dead of night
I'm falling right out of sight

I'm flying in water; it's all around
I'm falling slowly through the ground
Eagles nest near by
Deep in my sky

Trapped in a falling dream
Alone with a silent scream
Tumbling through dead of night
I'm falling right out of sight

I'm reaching out in the darkness
I'm trying to reach for your hand
But every time I get near you
You're gone and I don't understand
You know I've fallen, I've fallen
It's dark and I'm blind
Oh yes, I've fallen, I've fallen
Oh, oh, oooooh, ooooooooh, hahaha (Classic Gillan scream)

(Iommi guitar solo - rather long too)

It's night time, the night time; the day
Oh, life goes on in this rain
It keeps me from flying
Leads me to die
Trapped in a falling dream
Alone with a silent scream
I'm tumbling through dead of night
I'm falling right out of sight
I'm dead if I hit the ground
