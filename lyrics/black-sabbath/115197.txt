Winged with steel they fill the air 
The soldiers of fortune will ride 
In the sights of the enemy's gun 
Those who have taken their oaths tonight 
Are well prepared they know they'll 
Do or die even if it's suicide 


Let's take a chance 
As the skies will Burn tonite 
Wasted lives and spirits run free 
On the wings of no return 

Dressed to kill where eagles dare 
The fate of a nation's at hand 
Is this the answer to the prayers 
Come the dawn, thru the blood 
Red skies return with tears 
In their eyes, and they 
Recall thou shalt not kill 

And in the morning 
They'll take a hero's bow 
And make the ever lasting flight 

Hear them calling up above all 
Across the skies 
Hear them calling up above from 
The other side 

Here them call! 

Let's take a chance 
As the skies will burn tonite 
Wasted lives and spirits run free 
On the wings of no return 

Let's take a chance 
As the skies will burn tonite 
Wasted lives and spirits run free 
On the wings of no return
