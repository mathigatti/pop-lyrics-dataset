I am the crazy man
Who lives inside your head
But I think I'm breaking through the wall


You are the innocent
Convicted of the crime
No one was ever there
To catch you when you fall

I see the diamonds
But you only see the rock
I need to run
But you only crawl

It's time to open up
All the doors that you keep locked
Nobody gives without a take
Let's take it all

You've been twisted into pieces
By the hands of your emotions
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday?
Sins of the father

One more crucifixion
One more cross to bear
You're a hole in a photograph

Go on, lose it in the city
The city can feel no shame
See the world with electric eyes

They call it mystery
But any fool could see
You thought he walked on the water

And if the pain was gone
And you were free to run away
And get out

Would you get out of there
Or do you really care
It's not safe or easy
And maybe when you're gone
You just won't belong at all

You're the only witness
To the murder of an angel
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday
Sins of the father

It's just another crucifixion
One more cross to bear
Go on lose it in the city
Take a look at the world
You've got electric eyes
