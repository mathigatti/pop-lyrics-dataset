Ohhhh-oh

Pages of past,
Let my spirit flow,
From the ancient land,
From the coming of the dawn,
Visions of the door


Star of india
Hmmm

I can feel the start,
The scorchin' of the sun,
Faces cold and gray,
And my life has just begun, oh

Visions of the door
Star of india

Yea
Oh-ho

In the rivers of the day
Flow like riders on the dawn...drowning
One who turns from prayers
My life has just begun
Star of india
Oh yea

Star of india
Shape

Ahhh
Feeling my love

Take my love take
Iommi?:(shut me off)
Call me from the pain
I can shade my eyes some.
Let my star turn to lead

Visions of the door
Star of india
Oh no

Star of india

Oh yeah
I saw a blindin' light
It lead me through the night
I found the stairway to the star

Could this be god i see
The place i really hold to me
I found the stairway to the star

Star of india

Star of india
