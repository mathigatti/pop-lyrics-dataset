In The Daylight, Comes Darkness, On The Verge Of 
Night A Fear Is Born, 
Sweeter Than The Dream, The Reality Of You, 
Immaculate, Deception. 


From The Spirit Runs Poison, And The Wheel Of 
Fortune Is Ever Still, 
Sweeter Than The Light, The Darkness Of Your Soul, 
Immaculate, Deception. 

Something Has Touched, The Spirit Inside, 
Once There Was Love Now There's A Void. 
Night Of Deception, Ghost In My Mind, 
Am I Bewitched, Slave To Desire. 

It's Knowing That Time Keeps Rolling On, Night After 
Day, Day After Night, 
It's Knowing That Feeling Of Coming Home, To Where 
My Spirit Lies. 

It's Knowing That Feeling Of Coming Home, To Where 
My Spirit Lies.
