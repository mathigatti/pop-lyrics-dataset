The horizon breaks
where a figure stands
close your eyes and pray its a vision of God's command


He's evil, and mysterious
people fear his name
he's not here for deliverance

He's the Lawmaker
He's the Lawmaker

He never speaks
but his tasks we're told
to seek out souls of the sinners he'll trade for gold

He's evil, and mysterious
people fear his name
he's not here for deliverance

He's the Lawmaker
He's the Lawmaker

Silver mountians won't save you from Hell
the prince of darkness inside you will dwell

Your weakness your past
the Lawmaker comes

He's the Lawmaker
He's the Lawmaker
