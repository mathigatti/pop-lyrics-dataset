I am the world that rides the universal secret of all times
Destruction of the empty spaces is my one and only crime


I've lived a thousand times
I've found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceived

When little worlds collide I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell
And flashing memories are cast into the never ending well

The name that scorns the face
The child that never sees the cause of man
The deadly darkness that
Belies the fate of those who never ran

You gotta believe me
I'm talking to you

Well I know it's hard for you to know the reason why
And I know you'll understand more when it's time to die
Don't believe the life you have will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on

I want you to listen
I'm trying to get through

Love has given life to you and now its your concern
Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return
Still I look, but not to touch, the seeds of life are sowed
Curtain of the future falls, the secret stays unknown

Just remeber love is life and hate is living dead
Treat your life for what it's worth and live for every breath
Looking back I've lived and learned, but now I'm wondering
Here I wait and only guess what the next life will bring
Ha Ha!!!!
