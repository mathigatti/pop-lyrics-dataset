I still remember how it used to be
I thought the only thing
That mattered was me


You always told me it was just insane
To feel such joy
While others feel pain

There's no way to change this angry heart
Cause when love goes
It will tear you apart

And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a promised land
And the years slip by like so much sand

So many people who are dying to live
It tortures my heart
They've got so much to give

I never saw it as a battle before
To win the fight
There has to be more

And there's no way to change this angry heart
Cause all these fears
Will tear you apart

And it's been this way since time began
It's an endless journey, it's the fate of man
To live each day and never understand

And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a master plan
And the years slip by like water through your hands
No one told me the way I should feel
You left an aching heart
Lost and lonely, the feeling goes on
You were the one friend I had
You gave me so much love
Now the tears remind me you're gone

It still haunts me there's a silence
Where you used to be
It still haunts me
Just an empty space in history
It still haunts me
But life must go on, on and on

It's still haunting me
It's still haunting me
Haunting me
Haunting me
