So you lived your life precisely by the rules of the game
Is your mind an open page or will it always be the same?
Did you try to pass the point deny the holder's job?
If your heart lays with the rebel would you cheer the underdog?


When the better half is careful do you take the cheaper way?
Do you recognize your conscience when there's danger in fair play?
Is your mind in twilight guiding the constant noncommittal fog?
If your heart lays with the rebel would you cheer the underdog?

I won't ask you again if a chill comes to your hand
Some day I'm going back to a world I understand

When the morning light came too late did you ever blame yourself?
Would you leave the unprepared bed every time for someone else?
Is your word in silence heard to pass away the quick and mild?
If your heart lays with the rebel would you cheer the under dog?

I won't ask you again if a chill comes to your hand
Some day I'm going back to a world I understand

When the morning light came too late did you ever blame yourself?
Would you leave the unprepared bed every time for someone else?
Is your word in silence heard to pass away the quick and mild?
If your heart lays with the rebel would you cheer the under dog?
