Leading us on, to the land of eternity
Riding the cold cold winds of valhalla


The kingdom of odin is the kingdom of gods
Where only souls of the brave may rest in peace
But someone among them had the skill of deceit
And raised the hand that would open the road to hell

Chorus:
When the winds of valhalla run cold
Be sure that the blood will start to flow
When the winds of valhalla run cold
Valhalla - valhalla

The ring has been broken and a soul must be saved
Among the bravest of men, who rides to hell
The longships are sailing and the chariots ride
And yes the anger of thor will serve you well

Chorus

Raise your hands
Reach and valhalla will save your soul
Raise your eyes
And odin will lead us on

They say that history repeats itself
Upon the year of the seventh century
Well nobody knows, no you never can tell
So you'd better run now and hide away
