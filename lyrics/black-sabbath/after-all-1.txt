What do you say to the dead
Will you forgive me for living
Can't believe the things that they said
Wonderful day for a killing
It's killing me


What do they do with your soul
Is it just lying there busted
When did you lose all control
Is there someone to be trusted
With my mind

Oh there's insufficient evidence
Of what just might come after
But sometimes out of nowhere
There's demented sounds of laughter

Are we all haunted by
The ghost - imagination
It just can't be
I've seen them there
Howling at the Moon

Is it just me
Or does somebody else believe this
Well I'm not alone
And I'm not afraid
There's just one way to see

After all etc

What do you say to the dead
Is there a place where it's burning
It says in a book I once read
Yes there's a chance of returning
Turn to me

The fundamental principles
Say nothing of forever
But those are voices that I hear
Or I'm just not so clever

It can't be me
I know somebody else believes this
Well I'm not alone
I'm not afraid
Just one way to see

After all etc
