Look through the people and on through the mist
To the hill of the headless cross,
Where all witches meet, on a night such as this
And the power of darkness is host
They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul,
With an angel that fell from the sky.
Borne on the air, lot of screams and the wails
Of the masses appointed to die.


Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross.

From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground.
There's been no escape from the power of Satan.
On a nation so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross.

Ahahahohohoh Ahahahohohoh
Ahahahohohoh Ahahahohohoh
Ahhhhhhh...

How do ya feel when the locks refuse the key.
And the master is calling your name?
Does the luck of the charm, really keep you from harm?
Does the tallisman protect you from pain?

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross.

From the first evil night. when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground.
There's no escaping from the power of Satan.
For a people so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
oh no oh
oh!
(Headless Cross), at the Headless Cross
(At the Headless Cross), ohh, at the Headless Cross.
Ooh where will you run to?
At the Headless Cross.
Look to the Headless Cross oh
