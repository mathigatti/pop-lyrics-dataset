You see right through distorted eyes
You know you have to learn
The execution of your mind
You really have to turn
The race is run, the book is read
The end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old
But you don't want to know


Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

The people who have crippled you
You want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you
And there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom
Would take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see
Again the light of day

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies
You bastards!

Where can you run to?
What more can you do?
No more tomorrow
Life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares
Heaven turns to Hell
Burns out confusion
Nothing more to tell, yeah!

Everything around you
What's it coming to?
God knows as your dog knows
Bog blast all of you
Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath
Nothing more to do
Living just for dying
Dying just for you, yeah!
