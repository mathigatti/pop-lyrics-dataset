Cold is the night 
Lonely till dawn 
Cry for the light 
For the love that won't come 
You said that you'd never 
Leave me alone 


I gave you my heart 
You cried for my soul 
An angel won't come 
This devil won't go 
Something is wrong 
I just can't get away 

Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love 
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love 
But I'm a stranger in your arms 
Yes, I'm a stranger in your arms 

Maybe it's right 
But I just can't understand 
The hurt that I feel 
For my love second hand 
I know I should leave 
But I just can't walk away 

Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love 
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love 
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love 
I'm a stranger in your arms 
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love 
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
