Mortal eyes, looking through a veil of dreams
Hypnotised, an ever living soul with wings
Think you're god, but you never had control
Think you're loved but there's no one there at all.


My colours all ran dry, and now I see the world in
Black and white,
It's too late now, it's time to kiss the rainbow
Goodbye

Poison tears running from a palsied face,
Satan nears, descending on the human race.
Think you're god, don't you wish you had control,
Think you're loved but there's no one there at all

Listen to the wind, hear the gospel blow
Tell me that you don't hear what I'm hearing
And I will let you go
Look up to the sky, put your trust in me
Tell me that you ain't feelin what I'm feelin and I
Will set you free

Look into the flame, see the embers glow
Tell me that you don't see what I'm seein and I
Will let you go
Taste the holy blood, running from my veins
Tell me that you ain't feelin what I'm feelin and
I'll take away the pain
Yes I will now, oh yes I will, it's time to kiss the rainbow. Goodbye.
