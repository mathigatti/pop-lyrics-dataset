There's a man who sees all there is to see
What the future holds for all
As the days grow dark, was his sole and final warning
Beware of the one with invisible friends
They will steal into your mind
And all too soon, the signs begin to show


Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again

As the pages turn and the story's told
From the visions he's seen
The house on the hill
With the haunted eyes that call
no one laughed as madness came out
To play it's game
If you stay too long you'll finally go insane

Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again

Bells will take their toll
On your way
There's no way we're born to shine
Before our time, all your life
You're on your own
Lonely road
Lost in a time
Let the light lead your way
To the golden throne
It's the only way

Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up the shining
Don't be blind by fools again

Oh rise up, to the shining
Wise up they're gonna steal your mind
Rise up, the house is gonna haunt you
No one laughed, no one cried
You stayed too long
You're finally gonna stay
