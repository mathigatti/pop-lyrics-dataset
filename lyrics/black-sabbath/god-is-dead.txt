Lost in the darkness
I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my maker and savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine


The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine
You keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

Rivers of evil run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow
They kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes you cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

When will this nightmare be over? Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

To safeguard my philosophy until my dying breath
I transfer from reality into a living death
I empathize with enemies until the time is right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light

I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don’t need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the good book said?
Or is it just a holy fairy tale and God is dead?
God is dead

Right

But still the voices in my head are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down
The rain turns red
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead
