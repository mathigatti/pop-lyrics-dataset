Oh the devil is rising with the moon
He cries and my blood runs cold
Oh no never was the darkness so black
No light and nowhere to go


My spirit is crying for a love
So tired of being alone
I remember He came here to steal
And you are his stealer of souls

I see a Black Moon rising
And it's calling out my name
Oh it's calling my name

I've been blinded, lost and confused
Darkness will call me no more
Heaven is no friend of mine
No God ever knocked on my door

I see a black moon rising
And it's calling out my name
Oh it's calling my name

I'm standing on the dark side of time
Reaching for the power of her hand
She's weaving an unholy light
And calls from Lucifer's land

I see a Black Moon rising
And it's calling out my name
An angel of hell is rising
Heaven's no friend of mine

I see a Black Moon rising
And it's calling out my name
I see a black moon rising
And it causes so much pain

An angel of hell is rising
Heaven's no friend of mine
I see a black moon rising
And it's calling out my name

It's calling my name
This spirit's crying for love

Heaven's no friend of mine
