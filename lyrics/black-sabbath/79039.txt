Revolution in their minds
The children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live in
Oh the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through
Yeah!


Children of tomorrow live in
The tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow
Bring them peace in any way
Must the world live
In the shadow of atomic fear
Can they win the fight for peace
Or will they disappear? Yeah

So you children of the world
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the Words today
Show the world that love
Is still alive you must be brave
Or you children of today
Are children of the grave
Yeah!
