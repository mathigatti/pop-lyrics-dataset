She's young, but lord what a woman she's quick as a brawl at five 
She's class, one hell of a woman, she really confused my mind 
She's bad, power of the pleasure is far enough ta chase 
She's fast, power of the pedal is keeping up the pace 


Wise up, she's some kind of woman 
Wise up, you can't get away 
Wise up, ooh just when you think that its safe 

I'm gone, I can't justify when I ain't got some control 
So long, I ain't gonna stop 'till I step right off this world 
She's gone, I guess I'm the winner of an innocent little time 
Don't look, a tap on the shoulder sends a shiver down my spine 

Wise up, she's some kind of woman 
Wise up, can't get away 
Wise up, oh just when you think that its safe (safe) ... 
She's back 

Cryin', to give all the lovin' but I never was enough 
I cried, I prayed up to Heaven but the Lord said, "Boy that's tough." 
This smile, only served me to ruin me when I thought I had direction 
That walk, how the hell did she do it every move was perfection 

Wise up, she's some kind of woman 
Wise up, you can't get away 
Wise up, ooh just when you think that its safe 
Ooh she's back 
Ah she's back 
Ahh my motors runnin' 
It's buzzin' 
Ooh she's back 
Ah 
Ooh she's back 
Ooh
