Don't come closer 'cause it ain't safe here
Just turn around now and walk away
I've gotta tell you, there are no rules here
Sometimes I wonder
What goes on there behind those eyes


When a promise is broken
And no one trusts you
Young ones crying
With their heads in their hands
When you talk about saving
The souls of the faithful
You can't help thinking
You've got blood on your hands
From a cross of thorns

Tongues of fire always talking
Wasted words that ring in my ears
We're still waiting, losing patience
Will all the lies of four hundred years
I've gotta tell you, there are no rules here
Sometimes I wonder
What goes on there behind those eyes

When a promise is broken
And no one trusts you
Young ones crying
With their heads in their hands
When you talk about saving
The souls of the faithful
You can't help thinking
You've got blood on your hands
From a cross of thorns

We gave you yesterday
And now you want today
From the hands of death
We take our daily bread
Now all we do is choke
And the words you once spoke
Fade away
Look at what you've done
It's a cross of thorns

Take away this cross of thorns
Look at what you've done
It's a cross of thorns
Cross of thorns
When a promise is broken
And no one trusts you
You've got blood on your hands
From a cross of thorns
