I think about closing the door
And lately I think of it more
I'm living well out of my time
I feel like I'm losing my mind


I should be at the table round
A servant of the crown
The keeper of the sign
To sparkle and to shine

Never, no never again
Listen to me and believe what I say if you can

Never, this is the end
You know I've seen the faces of doom and I'm only a man

Help me, tell me I'm sane
I feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain

Save me, oh, take me away
You know I've seen some visions from hell and I've heard what they say

I've got to be strong
Oh, I'm falling off the edge of the world
Think you're safe, but you're wrong
We are falling off the edge of the world

Look out, there's danger! Nowhere to run
Seems like desperate measures but sometimes it's got to be done
Over, it's over at last
And the message inside as we feel a new life from the past

We're falling off the edge of the world
Yes, the edge of the world
It's the end of the world
