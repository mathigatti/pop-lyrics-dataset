Misty morning
Clouds in the sky
Without warning
A wizard walks by


Casting his shadow
Weaving his spell
Funny clothes
Tinkling bell

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

Evil power
Disappears
Demons Worry
When the wizard is near

He turns tears
Into joy
Every one's happy
When the wizard walks by

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

Sun is shining
Clouds have gone by
All the people
Give a happy sigh

He has passed by
Giving his sign
Left all the people
Feeling so fine

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
