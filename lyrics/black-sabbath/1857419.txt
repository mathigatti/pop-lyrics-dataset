Now here I go
Hope I dont break down
I wont take anything, I dont need anything
Dont want to exist, I cant persist
Please stop before I do it again
Just talk about nothing, lets talk about nothing
Lets talk about no one, please talk about no one, someone, anyone


You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm afflicted, youre addicted
You and me, you and me

Im on the edge
Get against the wall
Im so distracted
I love to strike you
Heres my confession
You learned your lesson
Stop me before I do it again

Just talk about nothing, lets talk about nothing
Lets talk about no one, please talk about no one, someone, anyone

You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm afflicted, youre addicted
You and me, you and me

You're clear as a heavy lead curtain
Want to drill you like an ocean
We can work it out, Ive been running out, now Im running out

Dont be mad about it baby
You and me, you and me
I want to tie you, crucify you
Kneel before you, revile your body
You and me, were made in heaven
I want to take you, I want to break you
Supplicate you, are incurable
I want to bathe you in holy water I want to kill you
Upon the alter, you and me, you and me
