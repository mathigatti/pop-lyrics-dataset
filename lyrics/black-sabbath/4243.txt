We sail
Through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs


The Moon
In silver trees
Falls down in tears
Light of the night

The earth
A purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always

While down
Below the trees
Bathed in a cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks down the night

And so
We pass on by
The crimson eye
Of great God Mars
As we travel
The universe
