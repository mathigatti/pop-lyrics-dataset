Gather the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Chain the sun, and it tears away (and it breaks) you as you run, you run, you run


Behind the smile, there's danger and a promise to be told
You'll never get old!
Life's fantasy to be locked away and still to think you're free
You're free, we're free

So live for today, but tomorrow never comes
Die young, die young
Can't you see the writing in the end?
Die young, gonna die young
Someone stopped the fall

Gather the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Then chain the sun, and it tears away, (and it breaks) you as you run, you run, you run
So live for today, but tomorrow never comes

Die young, young
Die young, die young
Die young, die young, young
Die young, die young, die young, die young, die young, die young
Die young!
