Man of madness who lives in my head
Keeping me awake at night, he sits on my bed
He drives me crazy he won't go away
Playing his game every night and every day


My mind feels heavy, my body feels weak
Suicidal thoughts crying out for some sleep
Impending you is what I'm about
Think I'm going out without a shadow of doubt

I search for serenity yeah, is it really out there ?
I don't read the holy books cause
they take me no where
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control

I'm paying the price now for
Selling my soul, selling my soul

I search for serenity, is it really out there ?
I don't read the holy books cause
they take me no where
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control

Im paying the price now for
Selling my soul, selling my soul

Yeah, selling my soul (x2)
Yeah, for selling my soul
