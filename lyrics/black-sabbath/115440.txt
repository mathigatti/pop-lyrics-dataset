In this last and final hour, you can't hide 
There's nowhere now that you can run 
All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light 
Princes and Kings, Demons with wings 
Summon your fears from hell 


It's the call of the wild Calling you 

In this last macabre hour, witches cry 
and turn to dust before the moon 
Many spirits are lost forever, but one survives 
To call the tune of lucifer 

It's the call of the wild Calling you 

Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams 
Hero, don't beleive in fate, it ain't what it seems 

All you gotta do now is stay free 
You're the one they turn to when hell screams 

Fear of the devil has no place among the brave 
Faced with pain, there's a battle to be won 
All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light 
Princes and Kings, Demons with wings 
Summon your fears from hell 

It's the call of the wild Calling you 

Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams 
Hero, don't beleive in fate, it ain't what it seems 

Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams 
Hero, don't beleive in fate, it ain't what it seems 

Hero, you got the fear of the devil burning your soul 
Hero, It's the call of the wild 
Hero, Tearing your soul
