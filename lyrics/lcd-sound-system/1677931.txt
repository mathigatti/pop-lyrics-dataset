From this position
I will relax
From this position
I can see the whole place


From this position
Oh, just relax
From this position
I make some stand
I make my peace with the man

And it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

From this position
I can see both of them
From this position
I totally get how the decision was reached

From this position
I can say "serious" or "cop-out" or "hard to define"
From this position, from this position
It's kind of like eating myself to death

You on the outside
Me on the inside
There's advantage to both

And me being uptight
And you being all right
There's advantages to each

From this perspective, from this position
I have a good grip on both of them
Because I have stayed home and have learned a little more about my neighbourhood, which is important
You know, there's a lot of good places to eat

So it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

So it's pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

With you on the keystroke
And me in the gang blank
There's advantages to both

And you have been all right
And I have been filmed being ridiculous
Oh, eat it, Michael Musto
You're no Bruce Valance

I have been untied
And you are all cross-eyed
There's advantages to each

And I'm coming back, coming back, coming back
Until there's nothing left in the well
Is that what they call it, the well?

I'm paralyzed and looking through you
But if nothing's right, we try anyway

As we compromised an arrogant person
I'm amazed at my decision to blame

On this occasion, there are a couple of things that we know that we learned from fact magazine
One, the king wears a king hat and lives in a king house
Two, your time will come, but tonight is our night, so you should give us all of your drugs
Three, we have a black president and you do not, so shut up, because you don't know shit about where I'm from that you didn't get from your TV

So times have been tough, and times have been tough
You have been put down, washed up, erased out
But honestly, and be honest with yourself, how much time do you waste? How much time do you blow every day?

So pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Oh, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

So pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

The return of the police

With you on the inside
Me on the outside
There's advantage to both

With me being wired
And you being tired
There's advantages to each

From this position, I feel affinity for the both of them, which is confusing
But honestly, I should be careful because otherwise, I'm being, I'm being, you know, what's it called?
Oh, fuck it

Reclining, I'm getting used to it
Like kissing under a bridge
It's an entirely new discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

A couple of weeks at home
And then a couple of weeks away
And then home and away, again
To use up your desire for discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

For an instant, you could have pushed through
But it's a plagiarized regret anyway
But what you want for now is someone to feel you
And that's the thing you like, is planning to stay

The return of the police!
