I used to dance alone of my own volition
I used to wait all night for the rock transmissions
So where'd you go
You led me far away
And let me go
Let me go


I used to see your hands in their weird positions
Used to like your head when you'd watch musicians
You said we'd know
Yeah we'd know
But that's all wrong
That's all gone, ooh

You made me throw my hands at my own traditions
And then you'd have a laugh at my inhibitions
Oh sure, we're talking tough
Yeah, we're talking tough
Yeah, we're talking tough
Put on suburban lungs
In prone positions

Here we go
You led me far away
And let me go
I never fall away
Here we go
Yeah we know
But that's all wrong
That's all wrong

I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm so tired to wake up

I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm so tired to wake up
