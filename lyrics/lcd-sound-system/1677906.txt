Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
So oh oh
That means making eyes across the room

(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm shallow doesn't mean that I'm heartless
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm heartless doesn't mean that I'm mean
(Drunk boys)
Sometimes love gives us too many options
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause you're hungry doesn't mean that you're lean

(Drunk girls)
I've heard lies that could curdle your heartstrings
(Drunk girls)
A couple truths, maybe burn out your eyes
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys leave their irons in the fireplace
(Drunk girls)
'Cause drunk girls give them too many tries

Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls...

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
Oh oh oh
I believe I'm waking up, but no promises
Oh oh oh
I believe in waiting out the weather
Oh oh oh
I believe in making up

The day becomes the night (x4)
Honestly, honestly, honestly
Unless it hurts, why do it?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Oh
