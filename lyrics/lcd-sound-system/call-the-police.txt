We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
This is nowhere
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nowhere
There is no one
Here


It moves like a virus and enters our skin
The first sign divides us, the second is moving to berlin
But that's not the state I'm in
The air is thin but that's not the state

The old guys are frightened and frightening to behold
Their heads come out fighting
And still doing what they're told
But you're waking a monster
That will drive you from your orioles of gold
And your body will get cold

And we don't waste time with love
It's just death from above

Your head is on fire, your hands are getting weak
We all, we all get stupid in the heat
You've basted your brains
With the shatter and defeat up on the street
And this is nowhere

The early years were boring
The quiet, unhappy punk
See mother was a cripple
And my father was a drunk but gentle man
So we do the best we can

This is the plan
Wear your makeup like a man

'cause we don't waste time with love
Yeah, we don't waste time with love
It's just a push and a shove

Well, there's a full-blown rebellion
But you're easy to confuse
By triggered kids and fakers
and some questionable views
Oh, call the cops, call the preachers!
Before they let us and they lose

When oh, we all start arguing the history of the jews
You got nothing left to lose
Gives me the blues

And we don't waste time with love
And we don't waste time with love

So call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Just chase the cops
Yeah, call the police
You're crazy, man
Yeah, call 'em up
Just call the police
The first in line
They're gonna eat the rich
