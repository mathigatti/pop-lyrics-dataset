You couldn't make our wedding day
Too sick to travel
You fell between a friend
And a father


I owe you dinner, man
I owe you something
You talk to me
Like I was inside
We were just waking up
For a moment
Interrupt

I meant to get to you
On the turning
Things sneak up on me
Like a landslide comes

Been saving e-mail trails
Kept together
I read them back sometimes
To remember
The time I wrote to you
From the island
Your quick replies
Made me high
Where have you been?
In the room
So I stopped turning up
My hands kept pushing down
In my pockets
I'm bad with people things
But I should have tried more

Been watching images
From the station
Earth one from satellites
All streaming
Feels slow at seventeen thousand miles an hour
You could be anywhere
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen

You could be anywhere
On the black screen
