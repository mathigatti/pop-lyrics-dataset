Wait for the day you come home from the lonely park
Look for the girl who has put up with all of your shit
You've never needed anyone for so long


You look in the bed; you've been gone for too long
To put in the time, but it's too late to make it strong

And all I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
At least all I want are your bitter tears

All I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears

When will it start getting dark and the girls are gone
So you're back again and into the late unknown
You never needed anything for so long

All I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears
Now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears

From now on, I'm someone different
'Cause it's no fun to be predicting
From now on, there's
'Cause I just want what I want

Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
