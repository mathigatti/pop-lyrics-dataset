Standing on the shore, facing east
I can't feel you
Standing on the shore, facing east
Your impermanence
You're taking water
Listing lazily, out of view


I remember when we were friends
I remember calling you friend

Standing on the shore, my ear aimed east
I can't hear you
I can't hear you anymore
I can't hear you
I can't hear you anymore

I still remember
Laughing and fighting
I still remember

Standing on the shore, watching for you
You're painted into a corner
Whatever fits in your pockets, you'll get your due
Just like before
With all the others

You warned me about the cocaine
Then dove straight in
Yeah, you warned me about the cocaine
Then dove straight in

In hiding, where there's more for you
(There's more for you, there's more for you)
(There's more for you, there's more for you)
(There's more for you, there's more for you)
(There's more for you, there's more for you)
(There's more for you, there's more for you)
(There's more for you, there's more for you)
(There's more for you, there's more for you)
(There's more for you, there's more for you)
(There's more for you, there's more for you)
(There's more for you)

Standing on the shore, getting off
You left me here amid the vape clowns
I must admit I missed the mountain
But not so much you

One step forward
One step forward
One step forward
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back

Standing on the floor, facing you
I can't see you, your impermanence
This place is empty
Empty of you

And if I see you, it's like nothing went wrong
Yeah, if we meet again tomorrow, just like nothing went wrong
But they

Erasing our chances just by asking how we sleep

One step forward
One step forward
One step forward
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
