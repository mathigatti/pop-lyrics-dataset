I don't hold you responsible
All the time I'm alone
I don't think, its unreasonable
So I'll cling all night long


The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up

Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

Here comes the big ideas again
Just like they did before and then
The morning comes again and its on and on and on and on and ooh (x4)
