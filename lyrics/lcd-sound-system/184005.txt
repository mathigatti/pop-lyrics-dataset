Daft punk is playing at my house, my house 
I'll show you the ropes, kid, show you the ropes 
Got a bus and a trailer at my house, my house 
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes 
I bought fifteen cases for my house, my house 
All the furniture is in the garage 
Well daft punk is playing at my house, my house 
You got to set them up kid, set them up 


You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah (x2) 
You got the set them up, set them up 

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah (x2) 
You got the set them up, set them up 

Cow bell solo 

Well everybody's lined up in my house, my house 
And Sarah's girlfriend is working the door 
Got everybody's PA in my house, my house 
All the robots descend from the bus 
There's a freak out brewing in my house, my house 
In the basement 
'Cause daft punk is playing at my house, my house 
You got to set them up kid, set them up 

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah (x2) 
You got the set them up, set them up 

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah (x2) 
You got the set them up, set them up 

And never, never let them go 
No never, never, never let them go 
Never, never, never let them go 
Let them go 
Downtown
