I ain't seen anyone for days
I still have yet to leave the bed
It's impossible
Feeling safe with it now
I'm impossible
Getting used to it now


I've just got nothing left to say
I'm in no place to get it right
And I'm not dangerous now
The way I used to be once
I'm just too old for it now
At least that seems to be true

I have a penny for your thoughts
If you could keep them to yourself
About you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
Don't want to hear it all now
Of how I'm slipping away

I can't make you a promise
We're not professionals
But if I don't like what it feels like
And if you don't
Don't like where it's been

It could be over if you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
You can change your mind
You can change your mind
