Tell me a line
Make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel all right


It's good in the dark
Good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight

So ring the alarm
Ring the alarm
Bar me and hold me and cling to my arm

Here it comes
Here it comes

And what you're asking me now
Disastrous now
Hoping and hoping and hoping the feeling goes away

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
This is why I fell in love

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just who I fell in love with

This is the time
The very best time
So give me a line
And take me home
Take me over

But dashing the hopes
Dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes

And love is a murderer
Love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
Yeah, we know

And love is a curse
Shoved in a hearse
Love is an open book to a verse
Of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me

But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change,
If it helps you fall in love

I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love

Turn on the light
Make it easy for me
Fill the divide
Fumble in the kitchen 'til it's right
What an awful sight

But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes
Love in your eyes
But maybe that's just what your lover finds all night

I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love

I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you feel real love

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
