Your feet touch the floor
And it's opened the window and let the light in
The light burns your eyes
But it eases with each passing frame
Yeah your head like a block
Stuffed with unwritten letters to some
Far away friends
Oh you'd write on your hand to remember
If someone, if someone would just, pass you a pen


Make your way to the toilet
These morning ablutions are all part of the dance
And these doors all have locks on them
Like tinfoil hats, man
Made for resisting (other voices)
Time isn’t over, times aren't better
So it's letting you down
You keep dragging back to it
You keep going back to the well
Oh that shit’s a dictator
Time won't be messed with
Buddy, no no no
You can't be believed
And you cannot believe what you are told
You're still a baby now
You're still a baby now
You're still a baby with soft feet and everything
You're still a baby for better or worse
Or for an hour or so
Until it's (other voices)

Please, if you’re coming home
Take me to the side
I know that time changes
To run away
From you

You’re still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a pushover for passionate people
And you’re just a baby now
You're just a baby now
With those soft hands and doe eyes
Resisting (other voices)

And you're still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a pushover for passionate people
You’re still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a
Tell 'em Nancy

This is what's happening and it's freaking you out
I've heard it, heard it
And it sounds like the nineties
Who can you trust
And who are your friends
Who is impossible
And who is the enemy
These are the halls that we're presently haunting
And these are the people that we currently haunt
Push back the walls
Push back the calendar
We've got, we've got friends who are calling us home

And you're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You should be uncomfortable, think I could be now
