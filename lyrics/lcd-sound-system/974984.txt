It's like a movement from the small place
To a bigger city
Or it's a bigger bag to strap the ego of a little baby
It's like a discipline without the discipline of
All of the discipline
It's like a culture
Without the effort of all the culture


Oh but I'm tapped
Yr pillaging and I'm tapped
Yr yesterday
And I'm tapped
Another reason I'm tapped

It's like a movement
Without the bother of the meaning
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a fat guy in a T-shirt
Doing all the saying
It's like a couple dads and a few friends
Trying hard to stay in

Yr history and I'm tapped
Yr fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
Yr pillaging
And I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

Here comes the report nothing to report see
It's all the same
It seems the punk rock as an experiment well
It pulled up lame
You got the fat guy in the T-Shirt
Doing all the singing
Straight to the drunk tank doing the research 'n
Doing all the blame

Yr history and I'm tapped
Yr fast asleep and I'm tapped
Yr pillaging and I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

It's like the culture
Without the effort or all of the luggage
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a movement
Without the bother of the meaning
It's like a culture
Without the culture of all of the culture

Yr history and I'm tapped
Yr fast'n'easy
And Im tapped
Yr pillaging and I'm tapped
And yr finiky so I'm tapped
