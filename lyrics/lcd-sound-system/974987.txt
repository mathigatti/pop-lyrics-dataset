Beats on repeat, beating on me
From every car in the street
There's a constant repeat, on repeat
Of your paranoid, heartbreaking beats
On repeat


It's a five song repeat, beating on me
With your favourite band, that helps you sleep
And here comes the new stylish creep
From every car in the street
On repeat

But know that it's yours 
Real life's a compromise

But your ? streak is beating on me
Well, my drink in the week is helping me sleep

All their children would line the streets,
Come to every show,
No one wants that

I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would flee the schools,
Come to every show,
Drugged and unwashed

I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets,
Come to every show,
Unwashed and drugged and

Beats on repeat beating on me
On your radio (x6)

Beats on repeat beating on me
Beats on repeat beating on me
