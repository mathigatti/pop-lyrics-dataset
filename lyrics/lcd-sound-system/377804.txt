Everybody makes mistakes 
but i feel alright when i come undone 
you are not making me wait 
but it seems alright as long as something's happening 
i try to make you late 
but you fighting me off like a fire does 
you try making me wait 
but it feels alright as long as something's happening 


get your payments from the nation 
for your trials and tribulations 

you try to make me wait 
you come around when it's come undone 
everybody makes you late 
and it's never you because you're always thinking 
i try making you wait 
and give you me some like you give it good 
everybody makes mistakes 
but it seems it's mine that always keep on stinging 

get your payments from the nation 
for your trials and tribulations 
x2 

you try making me wait 
but you come undone when you come undone 
everybody makes mistakes 
but it's always mine that seem to keep on sticking 

get your payments from the nation 
for your trials and tribulations 
x5
