I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient for a long time


One touch is never enough
You gave the opening, opening
One touch is never enough
People who need people, to the back of the bus

I don't see how we could be pleased with this
We've been waiting for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient such a long time

No one is dangerous
We are not dangerous
Unless we get a closer view

One touch is never enough
People need to move to the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
Complicated people never do what you're told to

One touch is never enough
People will need this in the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
People who need people are just people who need people

One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
People who need people are just people who need people

I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited such a long time
There's no way that we can be pleased with this
We've been waiting such a long time

We've been waiting such a long time
We've been waiting such a long time
This is getting sort of unreasonable
But we've been waiting a very long time

One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough

One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
People who need people, to the back of the bus

No one is dangerous
No one is dangerous
Until we get a closer view
