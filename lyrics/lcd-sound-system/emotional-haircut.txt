I'm not sure I want to step outside with my
Emotional haircut
It seems that I've been misunderstood
The look of grave concern in your eyes
And your surprise at my
Emotional haircut
It's better than me
It's much better than it used to be
'Cause now I got eyes going every which way
I got eyes all over the place
And I got tired of the hotel room and the tv
You missed that you've been told about whatever has led to this
Emotional haircut
It ain't a disease
It's just hard to do whatever you please
And dream yourself tonight
To a little love life


Now we all get ideas
I know I should shut 'em down with the
Emotional haircut
No I died a dionysian man
Oh no, buddy, no need to be concerned with this
Emotional haircut
It's part of the game
Yeah man, it's just part of the feat
So let's raise a glass to the bodies in here
Oh, raise a glass to the bodies in here
We're gonna toast till the bodies all soak up the bass
Man, you're in love with the bodies in here and your
Emotional haircut
Oh just get on the street
Fuck the shuffle, put your shit on repeat
You've got numbers on your phone, roughly ten that you can't delete
And you got lovingly dear moments from your past that you can't repeat
Yeah, you've got numbers on your phone of your dad that you cannot delete
And you're losing all your skin in the middle when you just can't sleep
I know you can't calm down

Out of your windows and onto the streets
Out of your windows
Out of a
Out to

Do you know what it does?
It puts me up on my feet
It puts me on the floor
But can you hear the heartbeat?
Can you hear the heartbeat?
Just listen to the heartbeat
But can you hear the heartbeat?
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen
It's coming down
