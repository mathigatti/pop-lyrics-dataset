I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new I could have started
Too late for beginnings


The little things that made me nervous
Are gone in a moment
I miss the way we used to argue
Locked, in your basement

I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised, as it's early
And that should be a perfect warning
That something's a problem

To tell the truth I saw it coming
The way you were breathing
But nothing can prepare you for it
The voice on the other end

The worst is all the lovely weather
I'm stunned it's not raining
The coffee isn't even bitter
Because what's the difference?

There's all the work that needs to be done
It's late for revision
There's all the time and all the planning
And songs to be finished

And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
'Til the day it stops

And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
'Til the day it stops

And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming

And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
'Til the day it stops

I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new I could have started
Too late for beginnings

You're smaller than my wife imagined
Surprised you were human
There shouldn't be this ring of silence
But what are the options?

When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone

When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone

We're safe, for the moment
Saved
For the moment
