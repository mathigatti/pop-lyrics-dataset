Christmas will break your heart
If your world is feeling small
There's no one on the phone
You feel close enough to call


Christmas will crush your soul
Like that laid back rock 'n' roll
But your body's getting old
It's much too tired to be so bold

Christmas can wreck your head
Like some listless awkward sex
So you refuse to leave your bed
Get depressed when no one checks

Christmas will break your heart
Like the armies of the unrelenting dark
Once the peace talks fall apart
But still I'm coming home to you

Christmas will shove you down
So just lay back in the snow
But that quiet wind won't wake
What inside you has grown cold

Christmas will drown your love
Like a storm down from above
On your fading memories of
A normal life

Oh, while I thought to make you mine
Believing in the line
That your heart would melt with time
And though you're out with them again
Your thick and fickle friends
They might replace the love that ends

But still I'm coming home to you
To you
To you
To you
Yes, you
To you
To you
To you

But what if you're done?
What if you don't want it anymore?
So what if they're gone?
So what if they don't love you anymore?

I'm coming home
Can you see me?
Can you still see me?
Hey mama, take my hand!
