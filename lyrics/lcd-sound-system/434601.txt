What will you say when the day comes 
When it's no fun 
When it's all done 
When it's no fun 


What will you say when the time comes 
There's a dry run when it's undone 
And there's no one 

When it's too much love 
Too much love 
Too much 
It's too much love 
Too much love 
Too much 

What will you do when you wake up 
Fatten you up 
Fasten you up 
Fatten you up 

No memories to get cloudy 
To get cloudy when you can't see 
What you can't see 

It's all the same when it's morning 
And you're boring 
Still ignoring everything 

No memories to remind you 
Of the old you 
Nothing for it 
Just keep it up, keep it up 

With no memory 
With no memory 
With no memory 
To keep you up at night
