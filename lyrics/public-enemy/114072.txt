Told Ya Buffalo Soldier
 Fell To The Ground Like Folgers
 Couldn't Hold The Boulder
 Fancy Dancer Paralyzed For An Answer
 In The Hip Hop Game But The Rap Got Cancer
 Tumors Poppin From The Middle Of Rumors
 Generation X Be The End Of Baby Boomers
 Is The Next Generation Headed For Doom
 Control The Soul And You Got A Got A
 Truck Fulla Fertilizer Blowin Up The Spot
 Think It's Terrorism The Border Line's Hot
 Check The Passports Tap The Telephone
 Surprise They Home Grown
 And One Of Your Fuckin Own
 It's Dat Same Ol Shit - Dat Same Ol Game
 From That Same Ol Gang Up To That Same Ol Thing
 Now What I See Say You Know Me
 I Pour A Metaphor Of LSD
 
 I Don't Know What Yall Thinkin About
 But If You Know Like I Know
 You Better Strap On Your Seatbelt
 Cause You In For A Long Ride
 
 Now I Be Damn I Been A Man
 Figure I Never Call Myself A Nigger
 To Get Benjamans
 What's Love Got To Do Wit What You Got
 Not A Whole Lot / No Forgot Oh This Shit Is Hot
 Spendin All The Cheddar For Clothes
 Wit A Sign Foreclosed On The Front Mud
 Lost In Dominoes
 
 Now The Heads Tell Tales
 How The Dead Bled And Fled
 Now They Livin Up In The Bed
 Instead They Seize Us Like Jesus
 Married To The Mob Did A Sloppy Job In Hempstead
 Lord Had Mercy Wanna Curse Me
 New World Order Got My Ass Drownin In The Water
 Now What You Stuck To The West
 That Funk To The East Is Phat
 Atl Be Krunk Dirty South
 Thirty Thou Crankin Trunks
 Try To Pass The Test But To The Rest They Flunk
 Now What Be Indebted
 Better Get Over It
 Those Times And Raps Ain't Never Comin Back
 No Future Without A Pass I Kick Ass
 Rock The Sox Offa Pandora's Box
 Is ItAny Wonder Why The Clocks Flavor Got
 Between Rehearsin A Verse My Jaw Lox
 I Set The Bomb Between The R &amp; B Scene
 Go Against The Grain Run Up On The Train
 And So I Parallel The Brains Of Cobain
 As Hip Hop Brain Made Em Spill The Champagne
 Make It Plain The Sound Remains Insane
 Come The Same No Holes Closin Up The Lane
 Don't Ask No Questions On The Simple Level
 Can The Magic Get Shaq Back
 Knicks Get Van Exel
 Bold Rap Lyrics Fuck Whatcha Heard
 Not No Lost And Found Nouns Or Half Ass Words
 Turnaround Funk Power Moves Ruffs
 I Ain't Never Been Cuckoo For No Coco Puffs
 LSD, Set It Free Make Em See The Tricks
 Rather Try At 37 Than Die At 26
 
 Lawyers No Loyalties Accountants No Royalties
 Lie For A Lie I Look Em In The Eye
 History Speaking Lawyers Should Die
 Kissed The Companies And Made Them All Cry
 A New Rap Song And A Real Drive By
 Why O Why Did The Video Die
 The Narcs And The Feds Got The Pimp Niggas Fraid
 Threat Of The Aids Got The Bitches Afraid
 The God Damn White Man Got You Afraid
 Social Service Got Your Mama Afraid
 Scared Of The Fact Before A Niggas Black
 Some Of You Say Nigga Before You Say Crack
 You Got No Back Is What You Lack
 Just Say Black And I'll See Where Your Ass Is At
