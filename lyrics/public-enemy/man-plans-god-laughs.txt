God damn, damn man
Man laughs at gods plan
God laughs at man's trash
Man plans
God laughs


Let it be
Fight the power
For the kids
Who don't know
You may ask yourself
Figured out

Bad news is
Bad news
The damn plan
Got you confused
Hood news
No good news
Ghetto burbs
See em as views

Am I radical
Am I radical
Am I radical
Am I radical
Am I radical
Am I pacifist
Am I scared to fight
Ain't asking you
Am I grown
Di I stand up
Am I owned

Let it be
Speaking words
But no wisdom
Make em dumb
Damn the plan
That man made
Threw the monkey wrench

Praise their favs
What they gave
Get attention
Now a days
It's the way
They get paid
To get saved
Pray to a stage

Do it for the culture, do it for the youth
Do it for the culture, do it for the youth
Do it for the culture, do it for the youth
Do it for the culture, do it for the youth

Am I radical
Am I pacifist
Am I scared to fight
Ain't asking you
Am I grown
Di I stand up
Am I owned

Be the change
You wanna see
And wanna be
Let it be
Revolution
What it is
Bring the noise
89 Another summer
Me to we
89 Another summer
Me to we

Do it for the youth
Do it for the youth
Do it for the youth
Do it for the youth
