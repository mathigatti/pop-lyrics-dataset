VERSE 1
Damn if i be some slave again
got no fake ass friends no timbs or rims
sure nuff dont know no designer names
and i never played no video games
i aint got no diamond rings
no bling, bling, no minks
no 2 earrings
no pimp glasses mugs
or cups and things
or whatever the hell they be
carryin
dont treat my highs too high
or my lows too low
you wont see my soul souled on no video
bdont need no checks to get no chicks
or be some hypocrite to get you on my
so let the young sing and rap to the young
as long as yall dont think freedom
is free to be dumb


VERSE 2
its suicidal to think im your american idol
hypnotic trapped in a 3000 mile box
chicks bobby sox today be botox
now that hip hops the new so called rock
parents dressin the outside
of their kids
an what they wear
instead of stressin the inside
way back , my peoples gave me pride
now in 2004 i aint gotta hide
if you cant afford it just leave it to the side
cause you looking real stupid with that tear in your eye
gotta a 1994 hear you talkin
but its damn sure better than walkin
it might be old, it sure aint gold
better than stylin in the cold
it aint no rolls,so wont get stoled
but you wont see me walking on no side of the road


VERSE 3
at the age i am now
if i cant teach
i shouldnt even open up my mouth begin to speak
i need some radio
to help me reach
but i heard they get their money on
by makin you weak
drowning in the sea of
some big dose of now
no past no future
let the young grow wild
aint gave em nuttin
some done robbed the child
from substance
dont currr , fill em up wit style
like hip hop started on trl, like wow
took the game and made it a gdamn shame
hell wit history you dont even
know my name
i aint the same damn thing
that yall used to playin
im non stop rocket
headin to your brain
now thats what im sayin


VERSE 4
i may not got no flow
but i aint pimped by no negro
backed by some
cracka wit
his ass by the door
therefore
i can never be poor
cause my mind , body, and soul
cannot be sold
priceless
so i avoid the trifelin
worms in my cipher
stuff yall cant get enough off
gots no time for
somebodys jail
my time is just like the US mail
my time is richer
than them new astro pitchers
i be damn if my face
be under some picture
where you heard the nword
so save your liquid
PE WE JUST here to flip it
find somebody new to get wit
the next time you hear a
cat who cant Stand or even look in the mirror
