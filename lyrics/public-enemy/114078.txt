I Came From A Place I Forgot
 I Woke Up In A Parking Lot
 Far From A Meal &amp; A Cot
 On The Corner
 Where All The Streets Got The Same Name
 Maybe My Brains On The Brink Of Insane
 Pain Between The PapersWhile Sleepin On The Train
 This The Land Of Milk And Honey
 Know What I'm Sayin
 The Invisible Man Times Three
 Black, Down &amp; Out
 Out Standing On A Corner No Doubt
 Now A Nation Of Homeless
 Sleepin In Bus Stations
 Another Win For The Pilgrims
 Who Said No More Haitians
 As I Proceed
 Someone To Feed Me Is What I Need
 Through Three Blocks Of Dealers
 Tryin To Hit Me Off Wit Weed
 Avenue &amp; Boulevard Hungry As A M-Fucka
 Hope To Get A Ride From A Trucker
 Everybody Know I Ain't No Sucker
 Everyone Used To Drop 30 At The Rucker
 Away From Crazy Kids In Generation Wrekked
 Dissin Pyramids While Praisin Projects
 Walk Past Old Folks Gettin No Respect
 Callin Young Folks A Bunch A No Good Rejects
 And I Walk On
 
 An Eye For An Eye
 I Can't Recognize The Man In The Mirror
 Is It I, It Is I Now Who This Cat I'm Lookin At
 Cause I've Been Waiting So Long To Get Where I'm Goin
 An For An Eye In This Country Tis Of Thee
 Now How The Hell Can I Be Free
 Who This Cat I'm Lookin At
 Cause I Been Lost So Long Without Anybody Knowin
 
 So I Move On And I Walk On
 Past The Preachers And The Pimps Gettin Their Talk On
 Now Why Do Home Gotta Be Where The Negative Roam
 To Be Or Not To Be - So I Roll Alone
 I'm Trapped Within This Skin &amp; These Bones
 Temporary Kings On Cellular Phones
 Can I Last As I Walk Past
 Cigarette Billboards &amp; Malt Liquor Ads
 Walkin On Broken Bottles &amp; Potato Chip Bags
 Everyone I See Got The Nerve To Brag
 Where They From What They Got
 And Don't Own Squat
 Disrespect Where They From And Ya Might Get Shot
 Zombies Askin Me What The Latest Bomb Be
 Should Shot The Fuckin Sheriff &amp; The Fuckin Deputy
 For Ok In The Drug Trade And Lettin It Be
 But I Know Prison For Me Is An Industry
 So I Walk
 I Heard The Best Things In Life Be Free
 Didn't God Make The Land The Air We Breathe
 Not For The Homeless Don't Give A Damn About Me
 In The Mirror Somebody Else Is Starin At Me
 Maybe Prison Is The Skin I'm Within
 All This Time I Been Sufferin Can't Fix It Wit A Bufferin
 Plus They Said I'll Never Work In This Town Again
 Damn So I Keep On Walkin
 
 An Eye For An Eye
 I Can't Recognize The Man In The Mirror
 Is It I, It Is I Now Who This Cat I'm Lookin At
 Cause I've Been Waiting So Long To Get Where I'm Goin
 An For An Eye In This Country Tis Of Thee
 Now How The Hell Can I Be Free
 Who This Cat I'm Lookin At
 Cause I Been Lost So Long Without Anybody Knowin
 
 Lil Day Day Is Big Day And Just Did Time
 Seen Him Standin On The Unemployment Line
 Which Collided Wit The Line Of The Health Clinic
 I Seen Crazy Stacy Her Ass Standin Up In It
 No More Welfare Cut Her Medicaid
 Damn My Mama Used To Do Her Braids
 I Keep Walkin So They Don't See Me
 But I Doubt If They Doin Any Better Than Me
 So I Walk On Never Take The Planet For Granted
 I Paved The Concrete, Asphalt &amp; Granite
 I Walk Past 3 Brothers Sittin On The Porch
 Wit A Yard Of Dirt And Littered Wit Newports
 Talkin How They Comin Up While They Sittin On Their Ass
 As I Walk Past Em I'm A Target Of Their Laughs
 And One Said Lets Get Em For His Fuckin Stash
 As I Walked Fast Past The Other Yards Wit Grass
 Had A Lil Cash Tried To Make It Last
 From A Few Deals I Made From Cleanin Windshields
 I Ran Like A Rally They Caught Me In An Alley
 Can't Get Out The Ghetto From New York To Cali
 I Thought I Had Nuthin Till I Felt The Knife
 And Now I Ain't Even Got A Life
