CHORUS
Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1,2
Cause my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you


VERSE 1
Quiet as it's kept
Some of y'all slept on yourself
Next time you hit the mirror black
Turn you back on yourself
I wouldn't trust some a y'all
If you was my right hand, man
I'd cut it off at the wrist
Like you name was Benedict
Enough lead
To threaten 50 niggas dead, you said
Cause niggas is back to perms &amp; relaxers
All up in their head
TV niggas only make you laugh, embarrass
Can u catch it
Nigga fever new season
Of modern day Stephen Fetchits 1990's
Niggas be fraid of the noise I made
Bout their master crackers giving out
Disasters in the hood
Phony honeys be gone when they moneys
Be gone
Niggaresses artificial chests'
Posin fake hair &amp; high dresses

CHORUS
Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1,2
Because my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you

VERSE II
Madd niggas hittin shit
But they health be quittin it
Clothes and car makin the men
Havin counterfeitin fit
Seizing niggas be praisin
Benzes Beemers when they got em
Shined and simonized foreclosed
Bit they grills be rotten
Simon sez niggas jump
And they jump for these Hilfiggers Tommy
Hates
Niggas high priced styles
White as wild rice
Niggas be dwellin in hell and the
Negros pray for heaven
Fuck the preacher he don't reach
You my nigga roll a seven
Niggas forgettin trips about those
Slavery ships
Niggas wasn't there they claim
Fuck that nigga bring the pain

Niggas be dealin Narcotic
But don't get the money nigga
Women or the fame my nigga
Or the mutha fuckin game

CHORUS
Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1,2
Because my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you
