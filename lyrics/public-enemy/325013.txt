In this corner with the 98
Subject of suckers - object of hate
Who's the one some think is great
I'm that one - son of a gun
Drivin' by - wavin' my fist
Makin' 'em mad when I'm goin' like this
Top gun - never on the run
They know not to come cause they all get some
Goin' quicker in the speedin' lane
Jealous can't do it and it's causin' them pain


Caught in my smoke - all they did was choke
Look at my spokes - you know I'm no joke
Out that window - middle finger for all
Jealous at my ride, stereo and blackwalls
Suckers they got the nerve and gall
To talk 'bout the car when they're walkin' tall

Chorus:
Suckers to tha side
I know you hate my 98
You gonna get yours (x2)

Pullin' away - every day
Leavin' you in the dust
So you know I get paid - on the mile ego trip
And 5-o tailin' on my tip
Watch me burn rubber - fall in my flame
This episode is always the same
Seein' no comp comin' like I'm blind
All left back - trailin' my behind
I go faster cops try to shoot me
They'll get theirs when they try to get me
I'll let it go - my turbo
Run, I'm in the river cause they're movin' too slow
Laughin' hard at their attempt
So what if the judge charged me contempt
I'd run my Boomerang - 'cause I'm feelin' proud
And I wouldn't even hear them cause my radio's loud

Chorus (x2)

Cruisin' down the boulevard
I treated like some superstar
You know the time so don't look hard
Get with it - the ultimate homeboy car
All you suckers in the other ride
Wherever I'm comin' get you my side
My 98 is tough to chase
If you're on my tail - better watch your face
Smoke is comin' when I burn
Rubber when my wheels turn
A tinted window - so super bad
Lookin' like the car the Green Hornet had
It's the reason I'm ahead of the pack
It's the reason I left them back
It's the reason all the people say
My 98-O blows 'em all away

My 98 Oldsmobile is...
My 98 Oldsmobile's so...
My 98 Oldsmobile is...
My 98 Oldsmobile's like...

Chorus (x2)

Understand - I don't drive drunk
My 98's fly - I don't drive no junk
No cop gotta a right to call me a punk
Take this ticket - go to hell and stick it
Put me on a kick butt - line up, times up
This government needs a tune up
I don't know what's happenin' - what's up
Gun in my chest - I'm under arrest
Sidewalk suckers wanted to spill me
So I got my crew and posse
Took their girls and got them to thrill me
Stepped outside - got in my ride
Drove them around an' I looked around town
Caught 'em out there cold - ran 'em over and down
They didn't get me and that's the truth
Cause the 98-O is bullet proof

My 98 Oldsmobile's so...
My 98 Oldsmobile is...
My 98 Oldsmobile's so...
My 98 Oldsmobile's like...
