look around what do you see
can you see what I see
hard to live without weed
catching hell without heed
phenomenons phenomns prodigys
20,000 maniacs just gotta be
human highlight flicks
they wanna be
hobbies turned to robberies
they killin me
the gun didn't know I was loaded
devil attempts to get heroes railroaded
stole the ball from lost souls
for whom the final bell toles
confused with moses in street clothes
he suppose he the one with the corn rows
blessed to do this outside j
do you know the way to the ABA


one on one
it's just begun
come to the house of the rising son

not one of these programmed cats
just off the black
where the shot clock at
don't back me if I with milky raps
smack me if I rhyme on silky tracks
takes a nation to get back
Mike sometimes the opposite of what ya like
I'm tired of the traps within
sometimes your brain's your cell
prison's the skin you in
getting change beyond point blank range
combined with the cross it's getting strange
here comes the sun
but who's gonna stop the rain
it's just begun
and some got done
got to beat the man
in the house of the rising son
