Played in Cincinnati
Wit my whole head nappy
Made a rally in the street
Wit nothin' but a beat


Gotta grudge against a judge
Kick 'em out that seat
You are what you eat
So what you eatin'?

Same message to your mind
Be self defeatin'
Sick n tired of bein' sick
And tired of bein' beaten

Saw 'em drop it like it
Was way too hot and too fast
For hip hop, doo wop, rock or bop
Ain't here to hurt you

Don't hang in them circles
Government ain't got me
Yet so y'all don't stop me
See a stampede of fake cats

Runnin' from Bill Cosby
What does he gotta do wit you doin' you?
Y'all know what?

DJ, Lord gimme that cut
Bring that beat back
That's what's up

Feedback from truly
Freed blacks
Gotta think outta this
Box of hard knocks

Lined 'em up at Fort Knox
To die in Iraq
You don't know I rock?
What you under a rock?

Old cats beggin' us to bring that beat back
Each generation thinks
The next one is wack
Jump started in the daze of crack

R&amp;B Reagan, daddy Bush
Way the hell on back
Pray to god
Feel like I got a church in myself

Good god, uh, can't get no help
I say again health care cutback
Shit is wack
Bring that beat back

They say the youth don't matter
And the old don't mind
It takes a lotta spine
To build all them young minds

Some of us get ghetto at the wrong damn time
Album what? We just makin' one at a time
To save another brother whose life on the line
A big shot to claim some rocks and shine

Signs of a soul gone solo, robbed blind
A very small part of half the worlds crime
Runaway child blown by an old land mine
Little ones workin' in diamond mines

So cats can say what's hers and what's mine
Diamonds is girls best friend
So why's he cryin'?

See when y'all hear it get near it
And you recognize the lyrics
You trained to refrain
And you start to fear it

Escapism
Like today there ain't racism
Obviously y'all ain't see
Black folks on TV

Judgment calls
Made on behalf of you and me
Or you and I
Do or die

I say an I for an I
Dividin' line
Got the poor people
Payin' for crime

Corporations gettin' paid off our jail time
Now y'all can tell Russell
Yes, I knock the hustle

'Cause 2 million in lock down
Under federal muscle
Beyond the streets

These kids is always watchin'
Watching some of these jerks
When they go berserk
So I work
