She wants a lover right now
But not no brother
Her man gotta have a lotta money
To get under her cover
Now she's a fine sister
But up here she's missin' it
She says she wanna learn about life
No old black bull shit
At the age of 15 a brother gave her a baby
She's 19 now and it drover her crazy
And now everytime
She turns around
All the people in the neighborhood
Look and get mand and sing


CHORUS

Meet Mr. Succesful
I guess he's blessed yeah
But he happens to be a brother
Who only wants blue eyes and blonde hair
Now this young mister
He don't like sisters
He couldn't find that special one
He know why he missed her
He says sisters wasn't good enuff
They only wanted his green stuff
That's why everytime he turned
Around all the people
In the neighborhood
Looked and got mad
And sang

CHORUS

I try to tell my people
There should not be any hatred
For a brother or a sister
Whose opposite race they've mated
No man is God
And God put us all here (yeah)
But this system has no wisdom
The devil split us in pairs
And taught us White is good, Black is bad
And Black and White is still too bad
That's why everytime I turn around
All the people in my neighborhood
Look mad and sing....

CHORUS
