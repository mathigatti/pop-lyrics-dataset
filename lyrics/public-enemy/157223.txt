Woman in the corner cold playin' her role
Leave her ass in the corner 'til her feet gets cold
Knowin' for a fact that girl is wack
If you hold your hand out she'll turn her back
Better walk, don't talk, she's all pretend
Can't be her friend unless you spend
Wall to wall, after all, get ready to throw
Only money at the bitch 'cause she thinks she's

Peekin' and seekin' inside a book
Her demand's for a man with a chemical look
Wishes and desires getting worse with age
She don't want a man, all she want is a page
Ain't got a man, so she goes to a club
She thinks it's classy, but it's really a pub
But that's the kind of place that she likes to go
The bitch got a problem 'cause she thinks she's

Jackets, shoes, everyday ties
The girl only wants one of those guys
Suckers who front it like it ain't no thing
Pretend to be a friend, don't want that thang
Talk like this, I don't talk slang
Do anything to get that thang
Tryin' to be chic and playin' it off
Peekin' through the window, saw her take her clothes off
Nasty girl, stone-cold freak
Layin' in the bed a whole God-damned week
Comin' and leavin', guys servin' up storms
From execs with checks, boys from the dorms
Never kept a name, never seen a face
She could pass 'em in the street like it never took place
I know she's a ho, so ahma go
Expose the funky bitch 'cause she thinks she's

She wants a sucker boy with an attache
If you ain't got it she'll turn you away
You can smile with style as you profile
But you got a gold tooth and she thinks you're wild
She don't want a brother that's true and black
If you're light, you're alright, better you stay back
'Cause the brother with the bag she's out to catch
With somethin' in his bag keeping her attached
The man got a plan, it's IBM
The devil at her level, yes it is him
His Audi she drive, his gold and clothes
The Ill Based Method turnin' up her nose
A-lack-a-lack-a-lack, cold beamin' her up
And she still got the nerve to turn her fuckin' nose up
Her status looks at us from down below
Now the bitch was in trouble 'cause she was

Little is known about her past
So listen to me, 'cause I know her ass
Used to steal money out her boyfriends' clothes
Never got caught, so the story goes
She kept doing that to all her men
Found the wrong man when she did it again
And still to this day people wonder why
Did he beat the bitch down till she almost died
Sophisticated
