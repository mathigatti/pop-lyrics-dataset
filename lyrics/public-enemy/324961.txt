I was wheelin'
Wit' the boom in the back
The treble was level
I like it like that
I was rolly-roll-a-roll rollin'
5-o looked and said hold it
And I stopped still
I never got ill
'Cause my license was clean an I showed
A peace powwow
Instead of pow pow
I'm straight up and I'm straight
So how you like me now
But I know how you do
You're straight from Babylon
But I know how you do
You're straight from Babylon
They said turn it down
'Cause it's a new law
You never seen us before
But we're raw like a war
They warned me once
They warned me twice
So I knew I was warned
They had it goin' on
I got the f--- outta Dodge
Wit' my Bronco
60 miles per hour
50 miles to go
And I be pumpin' the sound
Drownin' out the cars
Which tape should I rock
L.L.'s or R.A.'s
I'm in the streets of New York
(Go away)
So I pop in my Kool G Rap 'n' Polo tape
And they was at it again
Sirens in the air
Ahhh sh-t
So I'm outta here
But the blue in the front
Called the blue in the back
They cut me off
Stopped me dead in my tracks
But this is minimal
I'm not a criminal
I always did what I did
Because I'm not a kid
But they looked me down
They stared me down
Told me what I did
I ain't wit' it
'Cause word around town was a stickup
Yeah, yeah, yeah
B-boy niga in a pickup
But I was jeepin' and creepin'
Just a keepin' it down, sound
Here we go the run around
Blamin' me for the hardcore roar
But they the ones wit' the 44's
So I'm coolin'
I know the beat is rulin'
Too loud for the crowd
The bass is large yeah
So I'll get the f--- outta Dodge
That's right y'all, el commando
El commando you're in demand-o


SGT HAWKES:

Sgt. Hawkes and I'm down wit' the cop scene
I'm a rookie and I'm rollin' wit' a swat team
Packin' a nine can't wait to use it
Crooked cop yeah that's my music
Up against the wall don't gimme no lip son
A bank is robbed and you fit the description
And I ain't your mama and I ain't your pops
Keep your music down or you might get shot
This is a warning so watch your tail
Or I'm a have to put your ass in jail
I'm the police and I'm in charge
You don't like it get the f--- outta Dodge
