Can it be easy as 54321
Damn sun
Heard it was easy as
123
We dont control the 3 e's
Still we be on the plantation
And you be in trouble b
Dizzy whirls and niggerlodeons
In the nigger time
24 duckin the war
No shirt on like
Wakin up at 3pm , no job
Ridin around on a bike
Hair half braided
Half combed out
Smoked out
Still braggin about
How cats gonna come up
Get that hustle on
While them babys born
Headed to the club to get more chicks , cmon



These rhymes aint got
The glow of your normal
Fairytales
As another color passes
Another brother fails
No singin or blingin
Freestyle wingin
Beer can sittin around
Waitin for highlghts on espn
4321 over it
Some vince carter dunkin on mike ,an shit
Get yourself together
Before these feds start
Scrapin
Heads off the street
Sendin cats to the middle of heat
Far in the so called middle east
Somebody gotta
Communicate
Beyond the beats

5 retail chains
Got your brains trained
To consume anything
With a bang and a boom
Gimme room
Im sayin
Its a scam to pay for airplay today
But 4 major corps
Bought your support
Check the fine print
That cd you bought
Sony time warner universal
Notorius bmg
No lie they just got emi
3 radio corporations
Own all them so called
Black stations
While two tv stations
Gotcha kids waitin
Wb we be
Hatin the fact
Every 5 seconds
Canned laughter
Rolls off the faces of blacks
U p n you pick a nigger
To make the problem
Bigger
As i await the one video arm
Viacom
To get bombed
No doubt
