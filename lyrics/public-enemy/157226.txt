I'm countin' down to the day
Deservin' fittin' for a king
I'm waitin' for the time when
I can get to Arizona
'Cause my money's spent
On the goddamn rent
Neither party is mine
Nor the Jackass or the elephant


20.000 nig niggy cops in the corner
Of the cell block
But they come from California
Population is none
In the desert and sun
Wit' a gun cracker
Runnin' things under his thumb

Starin' hard at the postcards
Isn't it odd and unique?
Seein' my people smile wild in the heat
120 degree 'Cause I wanna be free
What's a smilin' face
When the whole state's racist

Why I want a holiday dammit 'cause I wanna
So what if I celebrate it standin' on a corner
I ain't drinkin' no 40
Thinkin' time wit' a nine
'till we get some land
Call me the trigger man

Lookin' for the governor, huh
He ain't lovin' ya, ha
But here to trouble ya
He's robbin' ya wrong
Get the point come along
He can get to the joint
I urinated on the state
While I was kickin' this song

Yeah, he appear to be fair
The sucker over there
He tried to keep it yesteryear
The good ol' days
The same ol' ways
That kept us dyin'
Yes, you me myself and I'ndeed

What he need is a nosebleed
Read between the lines
They think you see the lies
Politically planned
I understand that's all she wrote
When we see the real side
That hide behind the vote

They can't understand why he the man
I'm singin' about a king
They don't like it
When I decide to mike it
Wait I'm waitin' for the date
For the man who demands respect
'Cause he was great c'mon
I'm on the one mission
To get a politician meet to
Honor or he's a gonner
By the time I get to Arizona

Well, I got 25 days to do it
If a wall in the way
Just watch me go thru it
'Cause I gotta do what I gotta do
P.E. number one
Gets the job done
When it's done and over
Was because I drove'er
Thru all the static
Not strict but automatic
That's the way it is
He gotta get his
Talin' M.L. okay
Go on and find a way
Make the state pay
Lookin' for the day
Hard as it seems
This ain't no damn dream
Gotta know what I mean
It's team against team
Catch the light beam

So I pray
I pray everyday
I do and praise Jah the maker
Lookin' for culture
I got but not here
From Jah maker
Pushin' and shakin' the structure
Bringin' down the babylon
Hearin' the sucker
That make it hard for the brown

The hard Boulova
I need now
More than ever now
Who's sittin' on my freedah'
M'opressor people beater

A piece of the pick
We picked a piece
Of land that we deservin' now
Reparation a piece of the nation
And damn he got the nerve

Another niga niga they say and classify
We want too much
My people plus nine is mine
I don't think I even double dutch

Here's a brother my attitude hit 'em
Hang 'em high
Blowin' up the 90s started tickin' in the 86

When the blind get a mind
Better start and earn
while we sing it now
There will be the day we know
Who's down and who will go

By the time I get to Arizona
