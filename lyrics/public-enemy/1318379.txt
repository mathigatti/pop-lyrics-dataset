Yeah, reminiscent of another time
And another state of mind
VERSE I
I used to flow
They used to call me a rhyme animal
Some of them don't call me rio mo so
I try a new style refuse to get wild
On the B side because I still got my pride
The pride comes from another time
My father and mother plus God
Blessed the rhyme
Born in 1960 seventy suckers quizzing
Me what was it like before everybody
Tried to be like Mike
Back in the day when our peeps had
To fight for our rights
To make the day fell alright
But there is no is without a was
No about to be buts or because..I got
Pride
Reminiscent of another time
Dashikis, bells, to straight legs
Platforms &amp; picks
See it wasn't just about the fro
It was what was underneath that fro
Black power for the powerless
Deuce and quarters, caddies 442's
Yeah pride


VERSE II
Say, say it loud
James singin black and I'm proud
I was in third grad when Dr. King got slain
And if I had to read a book about
The facts, the fact is that the black
Would be overlooked look
1967 I was seven livin proof of
what I had learned in my youth
what a difference a score and a
decade makes mistakes and super bad
breaks wait
I ate the food in the lunch programs
And now I see the young strung out on
Grams so I work on a go on
And so on and soon communicate to
Get the young straight
Cause I got the pride

TALK BREAK

Now in order for us to know
Who we are we got to know
Who we was and once we know
Who we was then we know who
Were gonna be

Pride

VERSE III
The panther party before lad-i-da-di
Put pride inside plus taught karate
Fed heads in many ways many days
Were served locked down protectin the
Black and the brown
Now today the old must spread it
I said it
If they don't communicate then the
You can't get it
Problems have to be solved they
Won't go away so man what
You say and don't sway
Gotta get that pride

TALK

Ritos and rebellions

I reserve the right to be nothing
But a man
We reserve the right to be nothing
But men and women
