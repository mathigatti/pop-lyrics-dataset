The monkey ain't no joke
So you want to mess with the coke
Boy oh boy oh boy oh boy
The monkey ain't no joke
You better leave 'em alone
He's home grown, he's the cyclone
He's the moan groan, Capone, the clone
The broken bone, tone


You've got to get off my back
We got the real Flavor Flav
Gettin' down with the sound
And he's tellin' you to get off his back

He's on your back gives you no slack
Don't give me no flack, because I know
Toe to toe, go to go
He's on my back
Get off my back

Aslam a lakem
And that's the way we take 'em
And if we got to frisk you down
Then that's the way we shake 'em
