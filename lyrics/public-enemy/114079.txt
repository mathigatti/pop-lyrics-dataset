Start A War On The Poor Gettin Mad Donations
 Takin Cheese Out Of Poor Nations
 Got Haitians Still On Sugar Plantations
 Wiped Em Out Called It Exotic Vacations.
 As You Dig It They Set Up Regulations
 Turn The Rest Of The World Into Cancer Patients.
 What's The Diff No Buts Ands Or Ifs...
 Now I Need A Place To Hide Away.
 Are You Ready Are You Ready
 
 Whose The Real Docs Of Death
 Oh No It's Doctor Death
 
 Killer Man Atomic B-Boys In Japan.
 Another Brother Dies Up In Sudan
 Kevorkian Got The Heads Lookin For That Kill Em
 Dead From The Feds Shit Man
 Contaminated In Sad Predicaments
 Blood Threats, Blastin Continents
 Kings, Queens Dead Presidents
 Can't Tell Me Where My Chiza Went.
 Take Em Down Blow The House Down Blaw
 The Evils Got You Wobblin Like Weebles
 Thinking You Equal, Killin Lost Peoples
 No Sequal Remember Biko
 
 Whose The Real Docs Of Death
 Oh No It's Doctor Death
 
 Whose The Real Docs Of Death
 Killin Millions Til They're Last Breath
 Got No Right To Be Dead Ass Wrong
 Killin Me Softly With your Songs
 
 Bring The Noise
 But Surrounded By Cowboys
 Indigenous But Wiped Out
 Diggin New Ditches
 Can You Dig It
 Turnin Tricks At The Tip Of Politics
 The Devils Slick, Gettin Their Head Split
 I Spit At Those Hypocrites
 So I Sticks To The Music
 Think About It It's God
 You Better Get With The Scene
 Keep You And I From Being Human Beings
 You Deserve What You Deserve,
 If You Believe What He Believes
 And Into Everything You Leave.
 Oh What A Tangled Web You Weave,
 When Destroyed By The Disease By 33 Degrees
 Bringing Satan Down To His Knees
