Here I Go

Here I Go, I Don't Give A Damn If You Wit Me
Stupidity, Shit I'm The Reverse Of Jiggy
All That Prettiness Running On Empty
Only Wusses Need Pity, No I Ain't From The City
5 Minutes Of Fame If You Don't Know My Name
Oh Yeah, I'm That Field Nigga They All Fear
Here's A Madd Salute To All My Troops
Fuck A Lawyer And The Law And All Them Suits
I Spits And I Vomit Cause I Come Like A Comet
Better Quit It If Yall Don't Know What Yall Gettin From It
Just Forget It If You Wit It, That Racket Runnin It
Come On Come With It, I Think I'll Fit It
Go To War But What The Hell I'm Fightin For
As I Soar Yeah Baby I Like It Raw
No Cigar, I Ran Over The Pop Star Wit My Car,
Again And May The Best Jam Win...


Here I Go ---- There You Go

Bingo, It Don't Matter If This Platter's A Single
Needin Needles Like The Beatles Needin Ringo
From The Beginnin I Told You How To See Thru The Linen
All That Talk But That's The Way
The Side Walks In New York
I Simplify Cause You Might Be High
Rip Shit In The Pit So What You Don't Like It
This Is Man Shit A Hip Hop Trip
On That Aggressive Tip But Rap Got Pussy Whipped
Got Out Psyched Down On That Turnpike
I Knew This Philly Who Just Wouldn't Get Right
Cause I Was Aware As A Square In Delaware
Execs Writing Checks For Sex In Spandex
Radios Gettin Sucked By Labels Under The Table
Mix DJ's Gettin Overpaid For Airplay
Try To Shut Me Down Like Ray, What I Say?
Fuck Your Friends And May The Best Jam Win

Here I Go ---- There You Go

Mirror Mirror I'm Finger Pointin At The Man
It Is I, I Interrupt The Program
Chuck D Rubberneckin With The Fans
PE Don't Give A Damn About Uncle Sam
And On And On Like I Said Before
Some, The 100 Meter Dash, I'm The Marathon
Against The Grain Comin Like A Train
As You Listen To The Sounds That Remains Insane
One On One And It's Just Begun
To Get Out The Ghetto And Get Something Done
To Be The Man You Gotta Beat The Man
Don't Confuse Me With Being Dumb Or Bubble Gum
And I'll Be Here As You Disappear
And I'll Be Around Amongst The Crowd
Cause Anything I Wear Is A Step On Down
That's How I've Always Been
And May The Best Jam Win...
