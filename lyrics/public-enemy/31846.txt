If man is the father of the son
Is the center of the earth
In the middle of the universe
Then why is this verse coming
Six times rehearsed?
Don't freestyle much so
I write em like such
Amongst the fiends
Controlled by the screens
What does it all mean?
All this shit I'm seein
Human beings scream vocal javelins
Signs of a local nigga unravelin
My wandering
Got my ass wondering
Where christ is
In all this Crisis
Hatin' Satan
Never knew what nice is
Check the papers
While I bet on isis
More than your eyes can see
And ears can here
Year by year
All the sense disappears
Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced wit fear
Beware
2 Triple 0 is near


It might feel good
It might sound a lil somethin
But damn the game
If it don't mean nuttin
What is game who got game?
Where's the game
In life?
Behind the game
Behind the game
I got game
She got game
We got game
They got game
He got game
It might feel good
It might sound a lil somethin
But the fuck the game if it ain't saying nothin'

Damn, was it somethin I said?
Pretend you don't see
So you turn your head
Race scared of it's shadow
Does it matter?
Thought are parations
Got em playin wit the population
Nothing to lose
Everythings approved
People used
Even murders excused
White men in suits
Don't have to jump
Still theres 1001 ways
To lose wit the shoes
God takes care of ol folks and fools
While the devil takes care
Of makin the rules
Folks don't even own themselves
Payin mental rent
To corporate president
1 outta 1 million residents
Be a dissident
Who ain't kissin it
The politics of chains and whips
Got the sick
Missin chips and championships
What's love got to do
Wit what you got
Don't let a win get to your head
Or a loss to your heart
Nonsense perseveres
Prayers heed wit fear
Beware
2 Triple o is near

It might feel good
It might sound a lil somethin
But, damn, the game
If it don't mean nuttin'
What is game who got game?
Where's the game
In life?
Behind the game
Behind the game
I got game
She got game
We got game
They got game
He got game
It might feel good
It might sound a lil somethin
But the fuck the game, if it ain't saying nothin'

Yeah, that's right
Everybody got game
But we just here to let you all know
That pe is in full effect
From right now until the year 2000
Hey, yo, my man sing it

There's something happening, yeah
What it is ain't exactly clear?
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I've got to be ready
It's time we stop chilling
What's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
It's time we stop chilling
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Hey, yo, these are some serious times that we living through g
And a new world order is about to begin
You know what I'm saying
Now the question is, are you ready?
For the real revolution
Which is the evolution of the mind
If you seek than you shall find
That we all prove from the divine
You dig what I'm saying
Now if you take heed
To the words of wisdom
That are written on the walls of life
Than universally we will stand
And divided we will fall
Cause love conquers all
You understand what I'm saying
This is a call to all you sleeping souls
Wake up and take control of your own seifer
And be on the look out for the spirits tonight
Trying to steal your light
You know what I'm saying
Look what beside yourself
For peace
Give thanks
Live life
And release
You dig me
You got me
