I never tried to pretend to have an
Accent that I never had
So why don't you stay away awhile
Come hear the freestyle
The quicker the sticks
With the guitar licks
Complete the beat for your feet
Check out the drum kick
I'm here to live for the love of my people
Kickin' it all about rebuildin' so all the children
Avoid the self destruction
So long I'm gonna do y'all a favor
Cause I got the flavor yea
Get low not high you can't deny
Homeboys and girls you'll testify
The p-e-f-u-n and the K will stay
And make your body sway cause we got
The funky beat on the street on your feet
Can you feel the heat in your mind all the time
You don't have to find the effect of the
Rhythm an the funky rhyme on your body
On your gear so have no fear in your hair
Everywhere if you dare take this never
Miss that funky list of super rockin' cuts
That you can't resist on the move make ya
Groove prove that we choose our cuts
Make you strut and shake your but
Bend your back get the knack of the
Funk attack
Yes, yes y'all take that
