Oh no
Struck by greased lightning
F--d by the same last name, you know what?
China aint never givin back that gottdamn plane
Must got this ol nation trained
On some kennel ration
Refrain
The same train
Fulla cocaine
Froze the brain
Have you forgotten
I been thru the first term of rotten
The father ,the son
And the holy bush-it we all in
Dont look at me
I aint callin for no assassination
Im just sayin/ sayin who voted for this asshole of the nation


Deja bush
Crushed by the head rush
15 years back
When i wrote the first bum rush
Saw you salute
To the then
Vice prez
Who did what raygun said
And then became prez
Himself went for delf
Knee deep in his damn self
Stuck in a 3 headed bucket
Of trilateral bush-it
Sorry aint no better way of puttin it
Noyou cannot freestyle this
Cause yo ass still aint free
If i fight for yall
And they get me
How many of yall
Is comin to get me?
None
Cause its easier to forget me
Aint that a bush
Son of a bush is here
All up in your zone
You aint never heard so much soul to the bone
I told yall when the first bush was tappin my phone
Spy vs spy
Cant truss em
As you salute to the illuminati
Take your ass to your 1 millionth party

Hes the son of a baaad
Hes the son of a bad man

Now heres the pitch
High and inside
Certified genocide

Aint that a bush repeat aint that a bush

Out of nowhere
Headed to the hothouse?
Killed 135 at the last count...texas bounce

Cats in the cage
Got a ghost of a chance
Of comin back
From your whack ass killin machine

Son of a bush aint that a son of a bush

Cats doin bids
For doin the same bush shit that you did

Serial killer kid uh serial killer kid

Hes the son of a baaad
Hes the son of a bad man

Coke it's the real thing
Used to make you swing
Used to be your thing

Daddy had you under his wing

Bringin kilos to fill up silos
You probably sniffed piles
Got inmates in texas scrubbin tiles

That shit is wild
Cia child
