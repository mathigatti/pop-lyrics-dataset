VERSE I(CHUCK D)
See my rhymes be hot like soul food spots
I don't give a damn
Jenny Jones 100 million homes
Grown folks doin anything
To be some known folks
Go tell Montell he gotta sue to
Get like Donahue


Between soap operas and bras
Commercials sop opraahh
Gossip by their own admissions
Failed smoke emissions

So enquired minds wanna know
How low can we go on a TV show
Hoochie and the Blow

Reverses the race
Cursed the nation the doom generation

The next voice you hear
Says get the fuck away from here
From pyramids, to hearin what he, she or
They did
Ain't no bizness on the screen
If you know what I mean

VERSE II(CHUCK D)
I be crawlin in that head
Like a virus
You say lemme try this
Way back when medicine
Scaring some of our children
Soul brother number one
Is back in black in you kitchen
Tell granma chill on those chitlins
Make no mistake Ricki Lakes
Eatin mad steaks
Off your bad breaks

Funerals and wakes
Some of that shit is fake Yeah!

She said He said
Baby/Mama stick it
All for TV time
Hotels and airplane tickets
Embarrass our asses and degrade
End of the day
Ain't that a bitch
Geraldo's getting paid

FULL CHORUS
He say she say
They got beef
Draggin their bizness all in the streets
Bad things is some of them think its cool
TALK SHOW CREATED THE FOOL

Laziness is in the house
Fat ass sittin up in the house
Slob wit no job is in the house

Rhymes be hot like soul food spot
I don't give a damn

VERSE III(ABNORMAL)
Tryin to portray themselves like
Their movie stars, big Willie style
With a mansion, francin, and fancy cars
But in real life they live in projects
And trailer parks all the bullshit they talk
Makes me wanna spark L's
Looking at channel zero for hell
They frontin like they saying something
But they ain't sayin nothin'
Players &amp; hustlers, hookers druggy's
Racist I'm tryin to face this
Poison that they tryin to feed to my mind
I'd rather be watchin BET Rap City
On my big screen TV believe me
When I say it, they do it for
The greed of the fame following
The trends of the Hollywood game
It ashame'
Sellin their souls for 50 beans
Looking like fools on the tube
Just to get the cream

VERSE IV (C.BREWSER)
Talk show host really TV evangelist
Living in the most scandalous folks,
With lies they can't handle it
Mad Drama
Trauma coming at you out to harm ya
Infect your mental with an infectious type
Of insomnia
Lies in disguise about women who really
Guys and guys who really
Women like that's such a big surprise
(can't read)lies its just like the whole world
enterprize best understand black man is
infinite potential
wise realize TV amazing confusion type
illusion brought to
your brain wash syndrome sending you in
a cyclone plus had for your health so best
leave it alone
