Man, you ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing
'bout your daughter, no, she's not my type
(but suppose she said she loved me?)
Are you afraid of the mix of black and white?
We're livin' in a land where the law say
The mixing of race makes the blood impure
She's a woman, i'm a man
By the look on your face i see ya can't stand it


*music*

Black man, black woman, black baby
White man, white woman, white baby
White man, black woman, black baby
Black man, white woman, black baby

Man, you need to calm down, don't get mad
I don't need your sista
(but suppose she says she loves me?)
Would you still love her or would you dissmiss her?
(hey!) what is pure? who is pure?
Is it european state of being, i ain't sure
If the whole world was to come through peace and love
Then what would we be made of?

Excuse us for the news
You might not be amused
But did you know white comes from black
No need to be confused

Excuse us for the news
I question those accused
Why is this fear of black from white
Influence who you choose?

Man, i don't want your wife
Stop screamin' it's not the end of your life
(but suppose she says she loves me?)
What's wrong with some color in your family tree? (yeah!)
I don't know
I'm just a rhyme sayer
Skins protected against the ozone layers
Breakdown, 2001
It might be best black or just brown, countdown!

*music*

Black man, black woman, black baby
White man, white woman, white baby
Black man, white woman, black baby
White man, black woman, black baby

Check it out
I've been wonderin' why
People living in fear of my shade (of my high-top fade)
I'm not the one that's runnin' but they got me on the run
Treat me like i have a gun
All i got is genes and chromosomes
Consider me black to the bone
All i want is peace and love on this planet
Ain't how that god planned it?

Excuse us for the news
You might not be amused
But did you know white comes from black?
No need to be confused
Excuse us for the news
I question those accused
Why is this fear of black from white influence who you choose?
