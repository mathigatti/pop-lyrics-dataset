How can you say to me yo my niga
Cursin' up a storm with your finger on a trigger
Feelin' all the girls like a big gold digger
Take a small problem
Make a small problem bigger
Say yo! I ain't poor I got dough
You don't consider me your brother no more
Goddamn kilogram, how do you figure
I don't wanna be called yo niga!


Yo niga!

Hey!
Yo niga!


I try to make my statements stick like flypapers
Judge says to me "yo niga sign these goddamn papers"
My boss told me "yo niga you're fired"
'Cause my body told me "yo niga you're tired"
Yo niga this, and yo niga that
I'm your niga now 'cause your head got fat
Flava framalama boy you won't figure
I don't wanna be called yo niga
Yo niga!

Break it down
N.I.G.G.E.R.
Niga
Everybody sayin' it
Everybody playin' it
Load it on a scale
'Cause everybody's weighin' it
Toby say "yo I be good niga"
"Niga get a shovel niga be good digger"
I don't care how small or bigger
I don't wanna be called yo niga
Yo niga...
