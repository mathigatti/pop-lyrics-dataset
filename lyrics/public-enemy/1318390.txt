[Charles Barkley] Halleluja Jesus, Halleluja!

Now here's the pop, turnaround jumper,
Hits the rim bounce away, the new slave trade.
Manchild, six feet five, but juvenile.
Thin line between getting bucks and gettin wild.
Brooklyn style, hundred thousand miles.
Parque tiles, leavin ankles broke in a pile.
Son got a ticket to fly, he can make it if he try,
To the sky, like a Coney Island ride.
Gettin pages, from his super agent,
Community raises at the clout or the cages.
No doubt, center stages, mad phases,
&gt;From behind crazies flippin through the faces.
Paper chases, love that many places.
Pros and cons, flics between the races.
He hold the rock, call for sweat shops.
Guard the set shop replaced by sex shops.
The highest bidder, no room for the quitter.
Gave seven tickets, under counterfittas.
Three cities a week, droppin needles.
Like the black Beatles take heed, what you need is...


[Chorus:]
Jesus (The incredible)
Jesus (And in your existence, huh)
Jesus(The incredible, yea)
Jesus(Check it out)

Crack my picture, never swith up.
Smack the back ups, pack them pick ups.
Resurrection of the two man vocal section.
The spirit in your dark ass direction.
Duckin them spray ups on my way that i thought be lay ups.
Won the battle wars, a thousand one push ups.
Here marks the return of them rules about Ruff Ryders.
Risin, chargin hard from the point guard.
Watch what you prey for, but know the team that you play for.
Need I say more?
Uh, scared of the resurrection,
Sacrafice yours, them maybe the revolution is basketball.
Changes, generanges. Which means rearrange shit,
Erase shit, stuck on Playstations.
Then the new plantations, I said a millions heads.
Waitin for another nation.
To make your world be free.
No shoppin sprees, there ain't no stoppin me.
Here's the fee, not the weed.
Got to see, God speed. What you need is...

[Chorus 2x]

Sticky D gives you fits, on them turnaround hippocrytes.
Comin and goin like flics.
Hit em net scripts, like a butcher.
Gettin all the chips musta been a road trip against the Knicks.
On T.V. showcasin kicks.
Must be the fan cause his video gettin all the chicks.
Walk up on a replay on Monday.
Sportscenter highlights, last second steal kept em real.
What you need is...
Jesus
Jesus (What you need is)
Jesus
Jesus (What you need is)
Jesus
Jesus (What you need is)
Jesus
Jesus
