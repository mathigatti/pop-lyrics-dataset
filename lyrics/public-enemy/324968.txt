Intro
500 years ago one man claimed
To have discovered a new world
Five centuries later we the people
Are forced to celebrate a black holocaust


How can you call a takeover
A discovery

Mass murderer
This side of the planet
Most people take it for granted
502 and still doin
Give a reason I'm hatin
October celebratin
The dead

Of the black the brown and red
Sick an tired
Of bein sick n tired
Dont jump to conclusions
Before I clear the confusion
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I'm talkin bout Columbus

Hit me one

I dont hate nobody
I hate that day
Its as crazy as Hitler day

Hangin heads and snappin necks
Splittin up kin
Makin familys wrecked
Turned this planet to a sewer
Provin to all just a lil grab
Will do ya
Or do us
So my disgust
Got credit from the ones that
Read it
Aint blind to the fact
Of a whack headline
And if you didn't I pay
No mind

That's how I feel
That's how I feel
This iz madd real

But these days
Is crazy as Hitler day

I don't hate nobody

It's impossible to discover a land
When people are already living there

Some thanks for the givin
When times are hard
&amp; some got the nerve to pray to God
Aint about turkey
&amp; cider that gets me sick
It's that take from the indian trick
Lookin pretty grim
When they takin da pill
From the sucker seekin somethin to kill
Now he got a day to celebrate
Aint that a trip
Cause the indians aint got shit

May 31st when it comin it hurts
Remember the dead and it makes me curse
When they dont include 100 million
Of us black folks
That died in the bottom of boats
I can carry on bout the killin till
Dusk &amp; dawn
And war ain't the reason they gone
Fourth of July a fuckin lie
When did we ever
Get a piece of the pie
Gotta whole day comin
Without no pay
Cause a fuckin job
Cant gimme no play
Even had enuff I huff &amp; puff
At brothers sellin the stuff
Takin in washingtons
Lincolns
Not they birthdays
Payback for em makin us slaves
