Behold The Whole Planet
 Upside Down I Put It Down
 Shuttin Down Disco Clowns
 I Get Around
 This Rap Game's Like A Sport
 Been Thru 2 Passports
 Ass Stay Up In Airports
 Black Man Still Gettin No Support
 Compensation We Ain't Seein
 Split By Europeans
 Damn Treated Less Than Human Beings
 No Matter
 Africa, Brazil, East St. Louis Or The Caribbean
 Traveled The 7 Seas
 Rocked Many Races
 Spread The Cash Cleaned Trash
 In A Lotta Low Places
 
 Seen The Look Of Love On Many Madd Faces
 When I Rhymed About The Time
 And Not The Paper Chases
 People All Over The World Given Madd Respect
 When I Identified Who The Government Wrekked
 What's The Soundscan
 Ask The Company Rep
 They Don't Care
 They Just About Keepin Their Checks
 
 Round and Round And Round We Go
 Where The Worlds Headed Nobody Knows
 
 Hear The Crime Rhyme Created A Lotta Robots
 Can The Real Lyric Fix The Shit That The Time Forgot
 Loops Gotcha Brain Gettin Locked
 Loaded Up Wit Words That Never Meant Alot
 And You Can't Call The Cops
 And Yall Don't Really Know
 And Yall Don't Hear Me Through
 Takes A Nation Of Big Brains
 To Break Up That Flow
 And The Game Ain't Changed
 But The Heads Be Rearranged
 In Danger
 My Language Is Rappin In Anger
 I Be Bangin So I Point My Finger
 While We Sleep
 Racists Set Us Up Like Sheep
 Every Time I Go Someplace
 Slaves Up In My Face
 Black People In A Plantation State
 No Control Of Soul
 Wouldn't Know Our Fate
 Now Am I Wrong To Hate Hate
 38 Countries 51 States Now You Tell Me
 Who In The World Gonna Compensate
 100 Million Lost Make A Nigga Wait
 Gotta Beg The Queen To Get Food On Our Plate
 
 Round and Round And Round We Go
 Where The Worlds Headed Nobody Knows
