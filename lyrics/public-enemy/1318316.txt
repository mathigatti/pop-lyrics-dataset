Back
For your bad ass
Yeah as you witness
I'm surrounded
By 2 more emcees
Outta my was council
My rottweiler or rhymes
B-wyze aka blast
Introducing my Doberman
Of destruction
Lyrical destroyer
Dow Jonz also know as John Connor
Of Moruturi
My war council comin smashin
Thru battle zones of microphones


VERSE I (Dow Jonz)
Yo, my man, the rhymes I write, they be
The illest
And I be fucking up careers like those of
Arnold,
Kimberly and Willis
You'll take the penicillin, run DMC &amp; Jay
Say I "be illin"
My crew ain't juicy, I am not cold chillin.'
I'm a super villain. Why I'd even room with
Dr. Doom
And we'd be killin! I'd rip a bitch in
London just for
One shilling. I'm on your cable, channel X
I'm causing
Strife, but it make me wanna holler, son,
The way they
Do my life.
Check it…
Executives in suites eat dinner and discuss
How I can make more for us, whenever I
Bust,
I step forth from the jungle in fatigues.
The everglades, canteen full of liquor.

I'm sitting on grenades, little women
Squirming from
The 12th down to 11th grades,
When they see me in the magazine
Upon they wall they stick the page, but
You're too
Young I'll take you moms
And shacked from shells and bombs
Uncle Sam make brothers Uncle Toms in
Vietnam

BRIDGE
Whatever goes
Whatever goes
Whatever goes
Whatever goes

CHORUS
Rock e rock rock on
Skull of skillz
Endonesia

VERSE II (B-wyze)
Yo, it's A LOW DOWN DIRTY SHAME
How I'm SURVIVING THE GAME
To get the GLORY
Son this ain't no WEST SIDE STORY
WHO'S THE MAN that started with the
BOYZ IN DA HOOD
And the 5 HEARTBEATS he would
SHUFFLE HOLLYWOOD
Could it be the KING OF NEW YORK
Up in the lights form them days in
CROOKLYN
To them HARLEM NIGHTS
In this NEW JACK CITY
I'm the man with the JUICE
Meet me UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT
BUSTIN LOOSE
THE MACK
The BLACK CAESAR
And if SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT
I'm a DO THE RIGHT THING and please
Her
Her man got a death wish
Cause he wanna fight
But I hold a LETHAL WEAPON
On JUDGEMENT NIGHT
You bring it on
Me's ain't ready for the battle
My POSSE will leave you
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE
48 HOURS of nuttin but TALES FROM
THE HOOD
Gimmie DEAD PRESIDENTS FELLA cuz I'm
GOOD

CHORUS
Rock e rock rock on
Skull of skillz
Endonesia

VERSE III (Dow Jonz)
God damn, like the 85'ers eat the ham
I'll eat up weak mc's and that means shorty
And his man
I'm Dow from the clique about to die
Others call me John Conner and perhaps
Some day
I'll tell the reason why
While Hiroshima darkens up the sky
I will lounge inside my shelter as you fry
As you're incinerated
I'll come around again forget me not…
I had to shine with darkness for a minute
That was hot.

VERSE IV (Chuck D)
Semen in a women
From the men without hats
Get your life split up like some Kit Kats
I seem to be triple teamed
By gang green
Who don't listen
Bluntz them must be hittin
(can't read) emission
( ) the position
( ) the tip of the slop
crackas be droppin a lot
like saltines out the box
I despise singin songs in the low rider
Duckin cynics fuck em
And those Johnny come critics

CHORUS
Rock e rock rock on
Skull of skillz
Endonesia
