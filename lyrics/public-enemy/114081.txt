One million bottlebags count 'em
 Think they can bounce the ounce
 And it get 'em
 Yo black spend 288 million
 Sittin' there waitin' for the fizz
 And don't know what the fuck it is
 An oh lemme tell you 'bout shorty
 He about seventeen lookin' like 40
 Treats his 40 dog better than his g
 When he gets a big b-o-t-t-l-e
 Oh he loves tha liquor
 But look watch shorty get sicker
 Year after year
 While he's thinkin' it's beer
 But it's not but he got it in his gut
 So what the fuck
 Yo niga what's up
 Now he's hostile to a brother lookin' out
 But I ain't mad I know what he about
 He's just a slave to the bottle and the can
 'Cause that's his man
 The malt liquor man
 One million bags count 'em all
 Other man gets happy
 Watch the killas drink 8 ball
 Don't&gt;

 Transfer interrupted!
 h stinkin'
 Then I ask a question you brother
 What the fuck is you drinkin'
 He don't know but it flow
 Out the bottle in a cup
 He call it gettin' fucked up
 Like we ain't fucked up already
 See the man they call Crazy Eddie
 Liquor man with the bottle in his hand
 He give the liquor man ten to begin
 Wit' no change and he run
 To get his brains rearranged
 Serve it to the home they're able
 To do without a table
 Beside what's inside ain't on the label
 They drink it thinkin' it's good
 But they don't sell the shit in the white neighborhood
 Exposin' the plan they get mad at me I understand
 They're slaves to the liquor man
 Back to my homeboy shorty
 He can drink it down
 And think nuttin' about it
 Pass it around and get tha 40 dog buzz
 At the same time
 Shorty can't remember what day it was
 Say I'm yellin' is fact
 Genocide kickin' in yo back
 How many times have you seen
 A black fight a black
 After drinkin' down a bottle
 Or a malt liquor six-pack
 Malt liquor bull
 What it is is bullshit Colt
 45 another gun to the brain
 Who's sellin' us pain
 In the hood another up to no good
 Plan that's designed by the other man
 But who drink it like water
 One and on till the stores reorder it
 Brothers cry broke but they still affordin' it
 Sippin' it lick drink it down oh nooo
 Drinkin' poison but they don't know
 It used to be wine
 A dollar and a dime
 Same man, drink in another time
 They could be hard as hell and don't give a damn
 But still be a sucker to the liquor man
