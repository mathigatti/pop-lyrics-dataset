People Runnin On Empty
 Rock The Sympte
 Outside 2001
 Other Side Of The Sun
 
 Running, Here We Go Tumblin
 Few Solutions, Honey They Polluted The Future
 Got Me Thinking Of A New Thing
 Revolverlution
 Computer Souls, Controlled By Confusion
 You Be Clubbin, While The World Around You Crumblin
 Think Its Funny? Bunch Of Crash Test Dummy's
 If All This Shit, Means The End Of My Money,
 This Is A Stick Up, Off Go The Pagers And Celly's
 US Dollar, Aint Worth What It's Printed On,
 Backed By The Pentagon, Sounds Like Babylon,
 So I Babble On, Some Of Us Stuck
 In Them Barbershops And Them Hair Salons,
 While The Crash Comin At Your Ass...
 While The Crash Comin At Your Ass Like A Bomb.
 
 Now It All Comes Tumblin, Runnin
 Time Is Runnin Runnin Crash Is Coming,
 Break The Bank, Spinning Since The Beginning,
 Now It All Comes Tumblin, Crumblin
 Time Is Runnin Runnin Crash Is Coming,
 Break The Bank, Spinning Since The Beginning,
 Willie Dynamite, Time To Cry And No Ice.
 Y2k, Fallin Out Of The Sky, So Its Chosen
 Your Ice Is Frozen, Don't Cry Dry Your Eye
 Ain't This A Bitch, Fuckin Glitch. Mother Fucker What
 The Count Down To My Account, Count It Down
 Ashes To Ashes, Dust To Dust, Hush Make That Head Bust.
 Last Hour No Control Tower
 Making New May Flowers, Fightin New Powers
 Have You Forgotten, The Other Side Of Rotten,
 Picking Electronic Cotten Diggin Digital Ditches,
 Lookout, Lookout For The Crash...Crash...Crash..
 
 Have You Forgotten, Have Yor Forgotten
 
 
 Y2k, That's The Question,
 What The Fuck Is Up Got The 85 Guessin,
 I Told Yall For Yall Protection
 Got Me A Name Change, A Pair Of Smith An Wessuns
 Starring Crescents Mad Packed With The Lessons,
 Figure 5% Got The 10 Counting Blessings
 Programmed By Programs Got You BowingTo The Man.
 Avoid Collisions In Mid-Air, Medicaid And Welfare
 Zero Zero What The Fuck Do You Care?
 All The Lights Be Out, You Can't Get Nowhere.
 All Around, That's Why I Found Tony Brown
 The World We Know, It's Going Down...Down...Down...Down
