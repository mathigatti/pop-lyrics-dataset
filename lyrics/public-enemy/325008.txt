War at 33 1/3
Haven't you heard
I got quick and clever
At the level of a scientist
With this list my fist pumps chumps
And don't miss
Sorry majority grudgin' against the enemy
And any other nigger wit an attitude see
And any other rapper whose a brother
Who try to speak to one another
Gets smothered by the other kind
No so divine so I heard it thru the grapevine
Sent the feds out to get mine
Time yo-yo to go Bronco in 90-91
Laughin' while they're searchin' for my 98


Accelerate the race from the chase
Looka my face
It ain't hate but they don't want a debate
To take great
Can I live my life without 'em treatin'
Every brother like me like we're holdin'
A knife alright time to smack Uncle Sam
Don't give a damn, look at the flag
My bloods a flood
Without credit
Black and close to the edit
I fed it, you read it, just remember who said it
War at 33 1/3 not really live
I rather do it at 45
Went west in the quest for my intelligence
Climbed a fence took a teacher on
Ain't seen him since, hence he winced
And convinced that the Black
Was back revolving to a renaissance
Bronze to gold I told felt bold
Taught a so called teacher our role
In civilizin' the whole globe
Banned unplanned as I said
I don't break down religion why?
There ain't a smidgen for a pigeon
Nature for bird, dog, worm or lion
So my question to man is
So why the lyin'
God's law I saw is natural factual
Only man creates a waste
Defiance in his haste
Based on scheme a scam
From some mastermind damn if we read it
And we see it and still be blind
No need to search a fake church
Evangelical, huster
Anglo taxin' to muscle ya
Check I wreck you guess yes
All the bullshit now that's progress
