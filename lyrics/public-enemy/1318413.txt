Welcome home to the terrordome
Land of the forbidden
Cause that man be sinnen
And his hand be hidden
To rule the planet
He planned from the beginnin
Superegoman sounds like lucifer is winnin
Yo he wanna buck us
So im stoppin all that ruckus
Yall dont know the d in my name
Is like fredrick as in douglas
Another body
Cause the feds crashed the party
You confuse your own folk
Running from the paparazzi
Dirty mind and tap water
Consumin yo body
Illuminati in the tomb
Poisonin the womb
Cant be a guinea pig
With the glock to the wig
10 years since we lost pac and big
Dont get it twisted dont get it confused
The term snitch
Revolutionaries use
When the government got the hood rhymin the blues
Thats the term when the whole town lose


See something you better say something
Cause saving something aint worth sayin nothing


Genocide on us where
They practice this
Thats why i pack the fifth
See how wack this is
They ready the clips
Replaced the whips
Not cars im tallkin bout them things that cause scars
Night and days i know i still fight the power
I know we came a different way than the mayflower
All them players rentin rims and hummers
Got taught by a teacher defending columbus
New thug robbin ids and pin numbers
Spot on my block
Be hotter than 10 summers
Stuck in last century like a fax machine
Left back from the future
Like some vaccine
From ghana, botswana to watts and queens
Is the tv killing black teens
And their dreams?
Dont get it twisted dont get it confused
The term snitch
Revolutionaries use
When the government got the hood rhymin the blues
Thats the term when the whole town lose


See something you better say something
Cause saving something aint worth sayin nothing


While some pass the criss
They happen to miss
The unexpected revolution
From some young catalyst
Untouchable on the fbi list
Not know knowin these facts is more hazardous
I rock intense
Knock your block wit sense
Welfare cut from them documents
Masses volunteering for them chips
Trace the hiv lane up that blood vessel
Irs in that chest
You gotta wrestle
Life is not a game
New war apocalyptic
See the wicked run and try to hide the statistic
Aint nuttin changed
Pe be the same crew
It aint a game
Once again gonna save you
Dont get it twisted dont get it confused
The term snitch
Revolutionaries use
When the government got the hood rhymin the blues
Thats the term when the whole town lose


See something you better say something
Cause saving something aint worth sayin nothing
