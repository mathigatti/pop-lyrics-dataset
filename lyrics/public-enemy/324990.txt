And you thought the beat slowed down
Power to the people
Get on up, get into it, get involved
Feel the bass as the cut revolves
To the brothers wit the 808
Like I said before PE got a brand new funk
Turn it up, boom the trunk, yeah
Internationally known on the microphone
Makin' sure the brothers will never leave you alone
To my sisters
Sisters yes we missed ya
Let's get it together make a nation
You can bet on it, don't sleep on it
'Cause the troops cold jeepin' it pumpin
(Power to the people)
Turn us loose we shall overcome
They say where you get that bass from
Hey ohh people, people as we continue on
Come along, sings this song, are you ready for '91
Rhythm nation pump that bass an
We like to know from Chicago, New York and LA
Are y'all ready, cause the plans in the jam
And we're ready to roll yo y'all got to tell me
Are y'all read read to go c'mon
(Power to the people)
Had to kick it like that as we roll as one
One under the sun, to all the cities and the side
Stateside and the whole wide
There it is
P-e-a-c-e 1991
