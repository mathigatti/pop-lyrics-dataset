Doctor doctor in a lab
Concocted a germ warfare to the botty

105 million goin down
In da ground

Most in da black an da brown
Ow!

How did I catch this riddle
If I didn't crossover
Like a Hardaway dribble

They blamed it on some
Green African money

Now ain't that funky

Were runnin outta

Germs they spread it
Warfare I read it
Quote me on this yes and I said it
Bet it

Bigger damage than the trigger &amp; glocks
Mass murder in mass from a
Blanket full a small pox

No guarantees gettin lesser fees
In Tuskegee blacks got shot
Wit disease

Tribe a mine killed by da swine

Who crossed da line?
Who did da crime

The mind of a world destroyin kind

Were runnin outta

Rage Against Time Speech On Slow Down

A lil piece of mind
While we runnin outta time
People of color
Goin out like no other kind
Madd drama genetic gettin wreck
Protect da neck check the epidemic
Drug use addiction &amp; murder

Infant mortality
Rest in poverty
Not piece
Disease till deceased
Sterilized
Realized
That beast
So heres a word to the wise
We're runnin outta
Time............time
