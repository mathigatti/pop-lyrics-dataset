Say it takes two to tango
But a crew to bang, yo
Superstar shootout
Overtime at Durango
Clear out/the box out
Practice at the range - yo
Get the D to step back
Unless they be deranged, dough
Rae me fa so la ti dough
The chiza/rarely do missa
Money earner isa
Barn burner
Highlighted by the headturner
Every step you take
Televised by Ted Turner
TBS and TNT
Sunday drain the tray
But drew the foul on NBC
Ain't no stoppin me
I told yall
I close the door on the series
Swept but they ain't here me
In case you forgot
This shot is hot
Boo yoww
Like Stuart on the Scott
Haves and have not
Go cat go
Let the legend grow
Game it like you game it
Better let em all know


1 for the chiza
2 for the flow
3 to get the heads ready
Go cat go
Go cat go

Go cat go
High and down low
Do it like you did
On the brother wit the fro
Good job baby
Get the crowd crazy
Put that finger up at the section ladies
Scream c'mon scream
At the chisa and the cream
Raised up in Brooklyn
But be ballin down in Queens
White man's burden
Be a black man's dream
Badge over troubled green
Be a triple team
Suits and ties
See the envy in the eyes
Controllin guys while the
Buyers lie about the size
High priced Adonises
Unkept promises
Boxscore forgets all the no name threats
Puttin numbers up
To get them numbers up
Keep bouncin
But whos countin?

1 for the chiza
2 for the flow
3 to get the heads ready
Go cat go
Go cat go

Go cat go
High and down low
Do like you did
On the brother
With the fro

Go cat go
Let the legend grow
Game it like you game it
Better let em all know

Go cat go
Let a player know
Coney Island style
Before you go pro
