Yo gee 
Come and get your New York Post 
New York Post right here 
Come on y'all 
Get the bost stubost stubost 
Coasta coasta New York Post 
Yo New York Post don't brag or boast 
Dissin' flavor when he's butter that you put on your toast 
Put my address in the paper cause I smacked that girl 
She's the mother of my kid's that I took around the world 
Disagreements happens to couples when they share a bond
You shouldn't try to drown your subjects in a duck pond 
If you're gonna tell a story about people's worries 
Watch what you tell 'em cause they don't bring you glory 
It only brings agony, ask James Cagney 
He beat up on a guy when he found he was a fagney 
Cagney is a favorite he is my boy 
He don't jive around he's a real McCoy 
Chuck D yeah, you tellin' Flav we got to let 'em know 
Here's a letter to the New York Post 
The worst piece of paper on the east coast 
Matter of fact the whole state's forty cents 
in New York City fifty cents elsewhere 
It makes no goddamn sense at all 
America's oldest continuously published daily piece of bullshit 
Flavor Flav is the one that makes The Post money 
Writers make embarassing headlines funny 
Tryin' to undress my past until it's naked 
Wont stop Flavor from sellin' no records 
Europe Asia to the street of New York 
Flavor Flav known for his finesse talk 
Do it to good for The Post to employ me 
New York Post can't destroy me 
Rapper of Public Enemy, rapstar beats lover 
With the headline of a fucked up cover 
Out the pot to the plate New York Post 
get your story straight motherfucker 
It always seems that they make our neighborhood look bad 
Here's a letter to the New York Post 
Ain't worth the paper it's printed on 
Founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton 
That is 190 years continuous of fucked up news 
Yo one can play the game, two can play the game 
Yo Flav read on can't forget you either Jet 
Flavor Flav is your best Jet yet 
My own people own the most business 
Write on faith of value'sness 
Should have checked with me before you wrote it 
Got it from another source and quote it 
Put it out like the new year bull drop 
In every beauty parlor and barber shop 
Flavor Flav world renown 
Can't keep a man like Flavor down 
Yo Jet be a good host 
Don't print bull like the New York Post 
Augh, looks like somebody slipped up here 
Anyway here's a letter to the New York Post 
Black newspaper and magazines are supposed to get the real deal 
from the source y'all 
Sorry, Jet you took the info straight out of The Post 
Burned us just like toast 
When it comes to getting you facts straight about P.E. 
Get your shit correct
