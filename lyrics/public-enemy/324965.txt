I gotta do what I gotta do (uh)
So who the hell is you
To tell me how my song is wrong
You don't know
Layout &amp; let the drummer go
You think my rap's about stealin'
But it's about feelin'
Sometimes drug dealin'
But few know how my flow
Don't get the proper review
I gotta do what I gotta do


Do whatcha gotta do first
Ooh
Here go da verse
I gotta do what I do best (uh)
Kick da Nitti &amp; Ness
The danger zone
They better leave me alone
I got posse
Lus the feds had better watch me
I picked a bone wit' Arizona
Droppin' kickin' a mission
Wit' no permission
I let 'em know why I did what I did
I got dialogue
Got 'em to even sing along
&amp; got the semiautomatic
Tongue to da young
When there's static
They come &amp; try to get some
They had the nerve to call the president
An' I wasn't hesitant
To scream I was a resident

So-called power of the people
Lookin' for the truth
Like guessin' my vest was never bulletproof
I'm edgin' close to the line
&amp; it's fine time to know
Why the hell &amp; da f---
I try to battle so
Much to touch never feedin'
A crutch to lean on me
Excuses is weak
That's why my look is mean
To the devils 'bout God
Another reason why it's comin' hard
My intellect doin' wreckin' effect
'Till it's through
Gotta do what I gotta do

I Gotta do what dey don't like
'Cause I got a mike
The more I push
&amp; the more you learn
&amp; dey burn, you get another turn
To take the helm recreate
The realm of leaders
Not to say you never need us
But in da mirror
You can do it, it's so easy to start
Yeah baby you can see it on
A flow chart
And just in case
They ever get me in da middle
Of things before I go
You know I'm gonna take a swang
Until dey give what dey never
Gave I refuse to be
A slave I hijacked
The airwaves
Let ya know the dirt
Swept under the rug
Give the brothers a pound
My sisters a lil' bigger hugs
My rat a tat comin' right
&amp; exact 'cause it's true
I gotta do what I gotta do
