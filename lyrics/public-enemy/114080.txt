Dollar A Rhyme But We Barely Get A Dime
 
 If You Don't Own The Master
 Then The Master Own You
 Who Do You Trust From Swindler's Lust
 From The Back Of The Bus
 Neither One Of Us Control The Fate Of Our Soul
 And Swindler's Lust
 
 Hickory Dickory Dock Hand In My Pocket
 Robbed Me For My Chocolate
 Mo Dollars Mo Cents For The Big Six
 Another Million Led To Bled Claimin They Innocence
 Is It Any Wonder Why Black Folks Goin Under
 Cause Niggas Be Sold In Bundles
 No Pressure Tell Me Why They Don't Care
 Rap And R &amp; B Pavin The Streets Of Belair
 From The Sales Of Singers No Longer Here
 The Bigger Killer Gets The Bigger Share
 
 Now The Ones I Attack The Negros Got Their Back
 And Know 80-20 Is A Whack Contract
 Forever Lack The Voice Of Real Black
 Stole Rock And Roll And Ain't Gave It Back
 Started Off My Defense
 Now They're The Ones I Defend Against
 Who Fell Up Into The Tricks
 Fuck The Fight The Power Shit
 Get That Chuck D Nigga Fixed
 And Keep Him Up Outta The Mix
 Well Hell Tell Em Chuck Don't Suck No Dick
 Be An Ass And The Ass Get Kicked
 Hand In My Pocket Robbed Me For My Chocolate
 Watch Em Swindle Yo Ass And Turn A Profit
 
 If You Don't Own The Master
 Then The Master Own You
 Who Do You Trust From Swindler's Lust
 From The Back Of The Bus
 Neither One Of Us Control The Fate Of Our Soul
 And Swindler's Lust
 
 
 They Don't Care About Me
 They Don't Care About You
 They Don't Care About You And Ya Crew
 Ya Family Neighborhood And Plus
 They Don't Give A Damn About Us
 
 Profit Off The Soul Of Black Folk
 Turn Em Into Bitchez And Niggas
 And Stupid Ass Jokes
 Laugh Wit Us Or Laughin At Us
 That Is What I'm Guessin
 We Interrupt This Program Wit That Question
 Laughin All The Way To The Bank
 Remember Dem Own The Banks
 And Dem G-Damn Tanks
 Now What Company Do I Thank
 Ain't This A Bitch Heard They Owned Slaves
 And A Ship That Sank
 
 If You Don't Own The Master
 Then The Master Own You
 Who Do You Trust From Swindler's Lust
 From The Back Of The Bus
 Neither One Of Us Control The Fate Of Our Soul
 And Swindler's Lust
 
 This Is For The Blues People In The Delta
 This Is For Everybody In The 50's That Didn't Get Their Money
 Little Richard Gettin Half A Penny A Penny
 All The Super Soul Singers Of The 60's
 All The Bands Of The 70's On The Outside Lookin In
 All The People That Didn't Make A Dime Off Their Session Playin
 And Even The Rappers In The 80's And The 90's
 Still Tryin To Get Paid For What They Put In
 
 If You Don't Own The Master
 Then The Master Own You
 Who Do You Trust From Swindler's Lust
 From The Back Of The Bus
 Neither One Of Us Control The Fate Of Our Soul
 And Swindler's Lust
