We the fans
Hopin they would be open
Tinted glass
Behind that tinted glass
Crowd waiting in limbo
Is that the limo?
But he dont give a damn
She dont give a damn
Just buy their product
Cause they a by product of a marketing plan
Can i just get an autograph?
Im fanatic number 2 million
Sign it to my mama
So she can cut the drama
Bought in a store in nicaragua
But you ignore the poor
Cant even get to your door


Frankenstar
You dont even know who the hell you are
I dont give a damn about your car

You dont even know who the hell you are
We dont give a damn about your crib
Only give a damn about what you did

Can i get a ride on that music
Can i get a look on that movie
All you gotta do is groove me
Security aint got to shoot me
How a fan get get close to you
What do you think im supposed to do?
Shit by the way i bought a poster too
I didnt take it back
Cause the show was whack
Bought a hundred dollar ticket
Told us where we could stick it
Frankenstar
Let us fans know
That you gonna do a 10 minute show

Hooooooo

Now you say you from the hood
Paid and laid
And now you think you gonna get sprayed
I see you grinnin at them humble beginnings
Fame just is like water to a gremlin
Fame is fake and it fades
Millinnum stars can be like grenades
Blowin up thinking we all got it made
In a mtv cribs
To fool them kids
The new monster mash
See em all dance for cash
Saw ya wit a new lawyer
So you
Better stash
But the vip section got your attention
And you cannot see that far past
Wrong inspiration
For a young nation
When you dismiss education
And your living rooms a playstation
Do your thing, not the thing do you
Dont fame gotta hold on you
