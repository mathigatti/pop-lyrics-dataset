When flav starts to get busy
Grabbin the mic and they say who is he
Cock deezal breakdown like bill bixbie
When i think, yo i think in 360
Gimme the mic an i¹ma solve all mystery
I dare any punk to try to step up and diss me
Cuz when he do, that¹s when he kiss dee
Titles go by and my style is fly
One more time i came here to rhyme
Gimme the mic and i¹ma go for mine
So emcee¹s all a yall shut up
When flavor¹s in the house we say


What what

Let flavor blow it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what

Now when i do my flavor dance
All the ladies go crazy in a trance
Nonstop booy from the clock on my watch
I can bring it from the bottom and take it to the top
Let me rock, come on let me get wit it
When i tell you what to get, don¹t get offended
Gimme the mic and i¹ma bend it
Transmissions from the sky yo i¹ll send it
Times on my hands yo sometimes i lend it
Though i¹m spendin it for a fact
I¹ll make you say what what
Cause flave¹s back

What what

Let flavor blow it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what

Now everybody listen to flav
If you don¹t listen to me you will end up in your grave
Most of these people¹s rhymes is whack
But i got a bunch of rhymes in my napsack
Walk on my back with the black hat
Got the rhymes to come on the attack
Can¹t you tell that i¹m really good lookin
They know me from miami, california
Back to brooklyn
Even in spain they knew flavor¹s name
In japan they know i¹m nice in the game
We maintain yo brothers feel the vibe
We did the first album and it came out fly
And don¹t ask why you won¹t understand
Styles we got millions of fans
So come on get down like this what¹s up
When flavor grab the mic
I will rip your butt

What what

Let flavor blow it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what
