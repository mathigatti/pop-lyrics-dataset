This is for the ones that do it 
This is for the ones that tell 
This is for the ones thats scared 
White mans' heaven is a black mans hell 


This is for the ones that take em 
This is for the ones that sell 
This is for the ones that O.D. 

This is for the ones on the corner 
This is for the ones in the cell 
This is for the ones under the ground 
White mans' heaven is a black mans hell

Black athletes - white agents 
Black preacher - white Jesus 
Black drug dealer - white government 
Black entertainers - white lawyers

Black success story - white wife 
Black police - white judge 
Black business - white accoutants 
Black record co - white distribution 
Black comedians - white media 
Black politicians - white president 
Black genocide - white world order
