Tom, catch your plane ride on time
I know you're part will go fine
Fly down to Mexico
Dot-n-do-do
And here I am
The only living boy in New York


I get the news I need
On the weather report
I can gather news I need
On the weather report

Hey I've got nothing to do today
But smile
And here I am
The only living boy in New York

Half of the time we're gone
But we don't know where
And we don't know where

Ah, here I am

Half of the time we're gone
But we don't know where
And we don't know where

Tom, catch your plane ride on time
I know that you've been eager to fly now
Hey let your honesty shine shine shine now
Dot-n-do-do-do

Like it shines on me
The only living boy in New York
The only living boy in New York

Ah, here I am
Ah, here I am
