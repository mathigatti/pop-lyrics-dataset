I was twenty-one years 
When I wrote this song 
I'm twenty-two now 
But I won't be for long 
Time hurries on 
And the leaves that are green turn to brown 
And they wither in the wind 
And they crumble in your hand 


Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl 
I held her close but she faded in the night 
Like a poem I meant to write 
And the leaves that are green turn to brown 
And they wither in the wind 
And they crumble in your hand 

I threw a pebble in a brook 
And watched the ripple run away 
And they never made a sound 
And the leaves that are green turn to brown 
And they wither in the wind 
And they crumble in your hand 

Hello, hello, hello, hello 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
That's all there is 
And the leaves that are green turn to brown 
And they wither in the wind 
And they crumble in your hand
