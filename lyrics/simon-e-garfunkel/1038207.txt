We share the days of laughter
We share the nights of sorrow
And in the morning after
We face the bright tomorrow
Side by side we'll always stand
Spirits flying high
Long as I can hold your hand
We'll never say goodbye.


We walk the halls of learning
And serve a proud tradition
The flame of truth is burning
To clarify our vision
Look at how the future gleams
Gold against the sky!
Long as I can share your dreams
We'll never say goodbye

There's little to be sure of
But we will last forever
For now we know the pure love
We feel when we're together
Then if someay we should part
We will not say die
Long as you are in my heart
We'll never say goodbye
