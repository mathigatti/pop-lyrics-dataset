They say that Richard Cory 
Owns one half of this whole town 
With political connections 
To spread his wealth around 
Born into society 
A banker's only child 
He had everything a man could want: 
Power, grace, and style 


But I work in his factory 
And I curse the life I'm living 
And I curse my poverty 
And I wish that I could be 
Oh I wish that I could be 
Oh I wish that I could be 
Richard Cory 

The papers print his picture 
Almost everywhere he goes 
Richard Cory at the opera 
Richard Cory at a show 
And the rumor of his parties 
And the orgies on his yacht! 
Oh he surely must be happy 
With everything he's got 

But I, I work in his factory 
And I curse the life I'm living 
And I curse my poverty 
And I wish that I could be 
Oh I wish that I could be 
Oh I wish that I could be 
Richard Cory 

He freely gave to charity 
He had the common touch 
And they were grateful for his patronage 
And they thanked him very much 
So my mind was filled with wonder 
When the evening headlines read: 
"Richard Cory went home last night 
And put a bullet through his head" 

But I, I work in his factory 
And I curse the life I'm living 
And I curse my poverty 
And I wish that I could be 
Oh I wish that I could be 
Oh I wish that I could be 
Richard Cory
