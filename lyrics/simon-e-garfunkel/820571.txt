Hey, Schoolgirl in the second row
The teacher's lookin' over
so I got to whisper way down low
To say, "Who-bop-a-loo-chi-bop, let's meet
after school at three."


She said, "Hey, babe, but there is one thing more
My school is over at half past four
Maybe when we're older then we can date
O - oh, let's wait!"
