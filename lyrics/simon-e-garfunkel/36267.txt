Someone told me it's all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe its true
Mmm-mmm-mm-m
Mmm-mmm-mm
Ohh ohh ohh
Mmm-Mmm-mmm


Its a light and tumble journey from the East Side to the park
Just a fine a fancy ramble to the zoo
But you can take a crosstown bus if it's raining or it's cold
And the animals will love it if you do
If you do now

Something tells me it's all happening at the Zoo
I do believe it
I do believe it's true
Mmm-mmm-mm-m
Mmm-mmm-mm
Ohh Ohh Ohh
Mmm-Mmm-mm

The monkeys stand for honesty
Giraffes are insincere
The Elephants are kindly but they're dumb
Orangutangs are skeptical of changes in their cages
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum

Zebras are reactionaries
Antelopes are visionaries
Pigeons flocked in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently
What a gas! You gotta come and see
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
