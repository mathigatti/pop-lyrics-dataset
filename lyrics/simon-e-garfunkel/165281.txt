Bye bye love 
Bye bye happiness 
Hello loneliness 
I think I'm gonna cry 
Bye bye love 
Bye bye sweet caress 
Hello emptiness 
I feel like I could die 
Bye bye my love, goodbye 


There goes my baby 
With someone new 
She sure looks happy 
I sure am blue 
She was my baby 
Till he stepped in 
Goodbye to romance 
That might have been 

Bye bye love 
Bye bye happiness 
Hello loneliness 
I think I'm gonna cry 
Bye bye love 
Bye bye sweet caress 
Hello emptiness 
I feel like I could die 
Bye bye my love, goodbye 

I'm through with romance 
I'm through with love 
I'm through with counting 
The stars above 
And here's the reason 
That I'm so free 
My loving baby 
Is through with me 

Bye bye love 
Bye bye happiness 
Hello loneliness 
I think I'm gonna cry 
Bye bye love 
Bye bye sweet caress 
Hello emptiness 
I feel like I could die 
Bye bye my love, goodbye
