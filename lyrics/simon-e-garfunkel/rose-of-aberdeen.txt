I'm a rambler i'm a gambler
I'm a long way from my home
If you people don't like me
I can make out on my own
'casue it's dark


And it's rainin'
And the moon gives no light
And my pony can hardly travel
On this darkened road at night

You know once i had a true love
Though her age was just sixteen
She was the flower of belton
And the rose of aberdine

But her parents did not like me
And now she feels much the same
If i'm writ on in your diary
Well blot out my name

'cause there's changes in the ocean
And there's changes in the sea
And there's changes in my own true love
But there aint to changin' me
