He was a most peculiar man 
That's what Mrs. Riordan says and she should know 
She lived upstairs from him 
She said he was a most peculiar man 


He was a most peculiar man 
He lived all alone within a house 
Within a room, within himself 
A most peculiar man 

He had no friends, he seldom spoke 
And no one in turn ever spoke to him 
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care 
And he wasn't like them 
Oh no! He was a most peculiar man 

He died last Saturday 
He turned on the gas and he went to sleep 
With the windows closed so he'd never wake up 
To his silent world and his tiny room 
And Mrs. Riordan says he has a brother somewhere 
Who should be notified soon 
And all the people said 
"What a shame that he's dead 
But wasn't he a most peculiar man?"
