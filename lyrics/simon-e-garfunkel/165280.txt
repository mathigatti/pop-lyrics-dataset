Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit 
Blessed is the lamb whose blood flows 
Blessed are the sat upon 
Spat upon, ratted on 
O Lord, why have you forsaken me? 
I got no place to go 
I've walked around Soho for the last night or so 
Ah, but it doesn't matter, no 


Blessed is the land and the kingdom 
Blessed is the man whose soul belongs to 
Blessed are the meth drinkers 
Pot sellers, illusion dwellers 
O Lord, why have you forsaken me? 
My words trickle down from a wound 
That I have no intention to heal 

Blessed are the stained glass 
Window pane glass 
Blessed is the church service 
Makes me nervous 
Blessed are the penny rookers 
Cheap hookers, groovy lookers 
O Lord, why have you forsaken me? 
I have tended my own garden 
Much too long
