Bad news, bad news! 
I heard you're packing to leave 
I come a-running right over 
I just couldn't believe it 
I just couldn't believe it 


Oh, baby, baby 
You must be out of your mind 
Do you know what you're kicking away? 
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby 
We've got a groovy thing 

I never done you no wrong 
I never hit you when you're down 
I always gave you good loving 
I never ran around 
I never ran around 

Oh, baby, baby 
You must be out of your mind 
Do you know what you're kicking away? 
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby 
We've got a groovy thing 

There's something you ought to know 
If you're fixing to go 
I can't make it without you 
No no no no, no no 
No no, no no no no no 

Oh, baby, baby 
You must be out of your mind 
Do you know what you're kicking away? 
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby 
We've got a groovy thing 

We've got a groovy thing goin', baby 
We've got a groovy thing
