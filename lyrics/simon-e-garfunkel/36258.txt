Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip slidingaway


Whoah and I know a man, he came from my hometown
He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown
He said dolores, I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering, I'm afraid that I willdisappear

Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip slidingaway

I know a woman, (who) became a wife
These are the very words she uses to describe her life
She said a good day ain't got no rain
She said a bad day is when I lie in the bed
And I think of things that might have been

Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip slidingaway

And I know a father who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done
He came a long way just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and he headed home again

Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip slidingaway

Whoah God only knows, God makes his plan
The information's unavailable to the mortal man
We're workin' our jobs, collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway, when in fact we're slipsliding away

Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip slidingaway

Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip slidingaway
