Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true, whoah Maybellene, why can't you be true
You're not startin' right, doin' those things you used to do


As I was motivatin over the hill, I saw Maybellene in a Coup de Ville, 
a cadillac a-rollin on the open road, yeah, but nothin out race my V8 Ford, 
The Cadillac doin' 'bout 95, she's bumper to bumper, rollin' side by side.

He cooled down, the motor cooled down
That's when I'd heard that highway sound
I kept back sittin' like a ton of lead
Got a hundred and ten a half mile ahead
Cadillac lookin' like it's standin' still 
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill

You're not startin' right, doin' those things you used to do
You're not startin' right, doin' those things you used to do
