Chorus:
Go tell it on the mountains over the hills and ev'rywhere and
you can go (go) tell it on the mountain, Jesus Christ was born.


Down in a lowly manger, Jesus Christ was born and the Lord sent
down salvation that blesses Christmas morn,
You can go upon the mountain, dwell both night and day. You can
ask the Lord to help you and He'll show you the way.

(Chorus)

You may be a watchman upon the city wall and if I am a
Christian, if I'm the last to fall
You can go tell it on the mountain over the hills and
ev'rywhere. You can go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ
was born.

(Chorus)
