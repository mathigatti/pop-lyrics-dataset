The first thing I remember I was lying in my bed
It couldn't have been no more than one or two
I remember there's a radio
Comin' from the room next door
And my mother laughed the way some ladies do
When it's late in the evening
And the music's seeping through


The next thing I remember
I am walking down the street
I'm feeling all right
I'm with my boys
I'm with my troops, yeah
And down along the avenue
Some guys were shootin' pool
And I heard the sound
Of a-cappella groups, yeah
Singing late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a "j"
And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and began to play
And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away

The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do
Well I guess I've been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor
But I never loved no one
The way I loved you
It was late in the evening
And all the music seeping through
