Time Time Time
See what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please


But look around
The leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside
Its bound to be a better ride
Than what you got planned
Carry your cup in your hand

And look around you
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hang on to your hopes my friend
Thats an easy thing to say
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again

Look around
Grass is high
The fields are ripe
Its the springtime of my life

Ooooh, seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
And at a convenient time

Funny how my memory skips
While looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime

I look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
