Here is my song for the asking
Ask me and I will play
So sweetly, I'll make you smile


This is my tune for the taking
Take it, don't turn away
I've been waiting all my life

Thinking it over
I've been sad
Thinking it over
I'd be more glad
To change my ways for the asking

Ask me I will play
All the love that I hold inside
