And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know (wo, wo, wo)
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
(Hey hey hey, hey hey hey)


We'd like to know
A little bit about you
For our files
We'd like to help you learn
To help yourself
Look around you
All you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds
Until you feel at home

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know (wo, wo, wo)
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
(Hey hey hey, hey hey hey)

Hide it in a hiding place
Where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret
Just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all, you've got to hide it
From the kids

Coo coo ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know  (wo, wo, wo)
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
(Hey hey hey, hey hey hey)

Sitting on a sofa
On a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates' debate
Laugh about it
Shout about it
When you've got to choose
Every way you look at it you lose

Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you Ooo ooo ooo

What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
(Hey hey hey, hey hey hey)
