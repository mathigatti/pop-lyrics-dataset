Slow down, you move too fast, you've got to make the morninglast
Just kickin' down the cobble-stones, lookin' for fun and feelin'groovy


Feeling groovy

Hello lamp-post, what's cha knowin', I've come to watch yourflowers growin'
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me, do-it-do-do-do, feelin' groovy

Feeling groovy

I've got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me

Life I love you, all is groovy
