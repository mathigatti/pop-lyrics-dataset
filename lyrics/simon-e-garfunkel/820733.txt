Wish I was a Kellogg's Cornflake
Floatin' in my bowl takin' movies
Relaxin' awhile, livin' in style
Talkin' to a raisin who 'casion'ly plays L.A.
Casually glancing at his toupee


Wish I was an English muffin
'Bout to make the most out of a toaster

I'd ease myself down
Comin' up brown

I prefer boysenberry
More than any ordinary jam
I'm a Citizens for Boysenberry Jam fan

Ah, South California

If I become a first lieutenant
Would you put my photo on your piano?
To Maryjane
Best wishes, Martin
(Old Roger draft-dodger
Leavin' by the basement door)
Everybody knows what he's
Tippy-toeing down there for
