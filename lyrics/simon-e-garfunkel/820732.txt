Why dont we stop fooling ourselves? 
The game is over,
Over,
Over.
No good times, no bad times,
Theres no times at all,
Just the New York times,
Sitting on the windowsill
Near the flowers.


We might as well be apart.
It hardly matters,
We sleep separately.

And drop a smile passing in the hall
But theres no laughs left
cause we laughed them all.
And we laughed them all
In a very short time.

Time
Is tapping on my forehead,
Hanging from my mirror,
Rattling the teacups,
And I wonder,
How long can I delay? 
Were just a habit
Like saccharin.

And Im habitually feelin kinda blue.

But each time I try on
The thought of leaving you,
I stop...
I stop and think it over.
