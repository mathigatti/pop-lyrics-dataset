My daddy was the family bassman 
My mamma was an engineer 
And I was born one dark gray morn 
With music coming in my ears 
In my ears 


CHORUS 
They call me Baby Driver 
And once upon a pair of wheels 
Hit the road and I'm gone ah 
What's my number 
I wonder how your engine feels 
Ba ba ba ba 
Scoot down the road 
What's my number 
I wonder how your engine feels 

My daddy was a prominent frogman 
My mamma's in the Naval reserve 
When I was young I carried a gun 
But I never got the chance to serve 
I did not serve 

CHORUS 

My daddy got a big promotion 
My mamma got a raise in pay 
There's no-one home, we're all alone 
Oh come int my room and play 
Yes we can play 

I'm not talking about your pigtails 
But I'm talking 'bout your sex appeal 
Hit the road and I'm gone ah 
What's my number 
I wonder how your engine feels 
Ba ba ba ba 
Scoot down the road 
What's my number 
I wonder how your engine feels
