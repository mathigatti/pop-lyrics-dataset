I met my old lover
On the street last night
She seemed so glad to see me
I just smiled
And we talked about some old times
And we drank ourselves some beers
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy after all these years


I`m not the kind of man
Who tends to socialize
I seem to lean on
Old familiar ways.
And I ain`t no fool for love songs
That whisper in my ears
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy after all these years

Four in the morning
Tapped out
Yawning
Longing my life away
I`ll never worry
Why should I ?
It`s all gonna fade

Now I sit by my window
And I watch the cars roll by
I fear I`ll do some damage
One fine day
But I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers
Still crazy after all these years
