In my little town
I grew up believing
God keeps his eye up on us
He used to lean upon me
As I pledged allegience to the wall


Lord I recall
My little town

Coming home after school
Flying my bag past the gates of the factories
My mom doing the laundry
Hanging our shirts in the dirty breeze

And after it rains there's a rainbow
And all of the colors are black
It's not that the colors aren't there
It's just imagination lack
Everything's the same back
In my little town

Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town

In my little town
I never meant nothin'
I was just my father's son
Savin' my money
Dreamin' of glory
Twitching like a finger on the trigger of a gun

Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
