I should have known you'd bid me farewell.
There's a lesson to be learned from this
And i've learned it very well.


Now i know you're not
The only starfish in the sea.
If i never hear your name again
It's all the same to me.

And i think it's gonna be all right.
Yeah, the worst is over now,
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball.

You never cared for secrets i'd confide.
For you i'm just an ornament,
Something for your pride.

Always running, never caring,
That's the life you live.
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give.

And i think it's gonna be all right.
Yeah, the worst is over now,
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball.

The story's in the past with nothing to recall.
I've got my life to live and i
Don't need you at all

The roller coaster ride we took is
Nearly at an end.
I bought my ticket with my tears,
That's all i'm gonna spend.

And i think it's gonna be all right.
Yeah, the worst is over now,
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball.
