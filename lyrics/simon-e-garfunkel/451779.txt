Well you can tell the world about this 
You can tell the nation about that 
Tell 'em what the master has done 
Tell 'em that the gospel has come 
Tell 'em that the victory's been won 
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy 
Into my heart 


Well my Lord spoke, he spoke so well 
Yes he did, yes he did 
Talked about the flames that burn in hell 
Yes he did, yes he did 
Now my Lord spoke, he spoke so well 
Yes he did, yes he did 
Talked about the children of Israel 
Yes he did, yes he did 
He brought joy, joy, joy into my heart 

Well you can tell the world about this 
You can tell the nation about that 
Tell 'em what the master has done 
Tell 'em that the gospel has come 
Tell 'em that the victory's been won 
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy 
Into my heart 

Well my Lord spoke, he spoke to me 
Yes he did, yes he did 
Talkin' about a man from Galilee 
Yes he did, yes he did 
My Lord spoke, he spoke to me 
Yes he did, yes he did 
Talkin' about a man from Galilee 
Yes he did, yes he did 
He brought joy, joy, joy into my heart 

Well you can tell the world about this 
You can tell the nation about that 
Tell 'em what the master has done 
Tell 'em that the gospel has come 
Tell 'em that the victory's been won 
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy 
Into my heart 

Well I don't know but I've been told 
Yes he did, yes he did 
Streets of heaven are paved with gold 
Yes he did, yes he did 
Now the Jordan River is chilly and wide 
Yes he did, yes he did 
I got a home on the other side 
Yes he did, yes he did 
He brought joy, joy, joy into my heart 

Well you can tell the world about this 
You can tell the nation about that 
Tell 'em what the master has done 
Tell 'em that the gospel has come 
Tell 'em that the victory's been won 
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy 
Into my heart
