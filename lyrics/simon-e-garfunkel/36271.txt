I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls


And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain drenched streets
To england where my heart lies

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
Kiss you when you start your day

And the song I was writing, is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave thier weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you, go I
