Mama pyjama rolled outta bed, she ran to the police station
When the papa found out, he began to shout, he started theinvestigation
And it's against the law, it was against the law
What what mama saw, it was against the law


Mama looked down and spit on the ground every time my name getsmentioned
The papa said: Oy, if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of attention!
Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm goin'
I'm on my way, takin' my time, but I don't know where

Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard

In a couple of days they're gonna take me away
When the press let the story leak
Now when the radical breach comes to get me released
Appears all on the cover of Newsweek
And I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm on my way, takin' my time, but I don't know where

Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
