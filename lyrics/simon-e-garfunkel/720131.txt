Good god! Don´t junp!
A boy sat on the ledge.
An old man who had fainted was revived.
And everybody agreed it would be a miracle indeed
If the boy survived
"Save the life of my child!
Cried the desperate mother.


The woman from the supermarket
Ran to call the cops.
"He must be high o something", someone said.
Though it never made The New York Times,
In the Daily News, the caption read,

"Save the life of my child!"
Cried the desperate mother.

A patrol car passing by
Halted to a stop.
Said officer MacDougal in dismay:
"The force can´t do a decent job
"Cause the kids got no respect
For the law today (and blad blad blad)."

"Save the life of my child!"
Cried the desperate mother.
"what´s becoming of the children?"
People asking each other.

When darkness fell, excitement kissed the crowd
And made them wild
In an atmosphere of freaky holiday.
When the spotlight hit the boy,
The crowd began to cheer,
He flew away.
" Oh, my Grace, I got no hiding place."
