Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kickin'down the cobblestones
Lookin' for fun and Feelin'Groovy


Hello lamppost
Whatcha knowing?
I've come to watch your flowers growing
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Dootin'doo-doo
Feelin'groovy

I got no deeds to do
No promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and readyto sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you
All is groovy
