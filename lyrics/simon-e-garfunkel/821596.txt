That Silver Haired Daddy Of Mine 

In a vine-covered shack in the mountains, 
bravely fighting the battle of time 
is a dear one who's weathered my sorrows, 
tis that silver-haired daddy of mine. 


If I could recall all the heartaches, 
dear old Daddy, I've caused you to bear, 
if I could erase those lines from your face 
and bring back the gold to your hair. 

If God would but grant me the power 
just to turn back the pages of time, 
I'd give all I own if I could but atone 
to that silver-haired daddy of mine.

Oh, I know it's too late, dear old Daddy 
to repay all those sorrows and cares, 
though dear Mother is waiting in heaven 
just to comfort and solace you there. 

If I could recall all the heartaches, 
dear old Daddy, I've caused you to bear, 
if I could erase those lines from your face 
and bring back the gold to your hair, 

if God would but grant me the power 
just to turn back the pages of time, 
I'd give all I own if I could but atone 
to that silver-haired daddy of mine. 

I'd give all I own if I could but atone 
to that silver-haired daddy of mine.
