Wake up, little susie, wake up
Wake up, little susie, wake up


We`ve both been sound asleep
Wake up, little susie and weep
The movie`s over, it`s four o`clock and we`re in trouble deep

Wake up, little susie
Wake up, little susie

Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell our friends when they say "ooh la la"
Wake up, little susie
Wake up, little susie

Well, we told your mama that wed be in by ten
Well, susie baby, looks like we goodfed again
Wake up, little susie
Wake up, little susie
We gotta go home

Wake up, little susie, wake up
Wake up, little susie, wake up
The movie wasn`t so hot
It didn`t have much of a plot
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked
Our reputation is shot
Wake up, little susie
Wake up, little susie

Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell our friends when they say "ooh la la"
Wake up, little susie
Wake up, little susie
Wake up, little susie
