I am a roving gambler
I gamble down in town
Wherever i meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
I lay my money down
I lay my money down


I had not been in washington
Many more weeks than three
When i fell in love with a pretty little girl
She fell in love with me
She fell in love with me
She fell in love with me

She took me to her parlor
She cooled me with her fan
She whispered low in her mama's ear
"i love that gamblin' man
I love that gamblin' man
I love that gamblin' man"

"oh mother, dear mother
Why do you treat me so?
The love i feel for the gambling man
No human tongue can tell
No human tongue can tell
No human tongue can tell"

"oh daughter, dear daughter
[inaudible]
With a gambler go
With a gambler go
With a gambler go"

I've gambled down in washington
I gambled down in spain
I'm going down to georgia
To gamble my last game
To gamble my last game
To gamble my last game

I am a roving gambler
I've gambled down in town
Wherever i meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
I lay my money down
I lay my money down

I had not been in washington
For many more weeks than three
When i fell in love with a pretty little girl
She fell in love with me
She fell in love with me
She fell in love with me
