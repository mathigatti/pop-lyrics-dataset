God rest ye merry gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay.


Remember christ our savior,
Was born on christmas day.

To save us all from satan's power,
When we we're gone astray.

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy.

God rest ye merry gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay.

Remember christ our savior,
Was born on christmas day.

To save us all from satan's power,
When we we're gone astray.

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy.
