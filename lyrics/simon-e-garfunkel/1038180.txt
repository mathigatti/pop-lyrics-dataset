Catch a boat to England, baby, 
Maybe to Spain 
Wherever I have gone, 
Wherever I've been and gone 
Wherever I have gone 
The blues run the game 


Send out for whiskey, baby, 
Send out for gin 
Me and room service, honey 
Me and room service, babe 
Me and room service, whoa 
We're livin' a life of sin 

When I ain't drinkin', baby 
You are on my mind 
When I ain't sleepin', honey 
When I ain't sleepin', momma 
When I ain't sleepin', well 
You know you'll find me crying 

Catch a boat to England, baby, 
Maybe to Spain 
Wherever I have gone, 
Wherever I've been and gone 
Wherever I have gone 
The blues run the game 

Livin' is a gamble, baby 
Lovin's much the same 
Wherever I have played 
Wherever I throw those dice 
Wherever I have played 
The blues run the game 

Maybe when I'm older, baby 
Someplace down the line 
I'll wake up older 
So much older, momma 
Wake up older 
And I'll just stop all my tryin' 

Catch a boat to England, baby, 
Maybe to Spain 
Wherever I have gone, 
Wherever I've been and gone 
Wherever I have gone 
The blues are all the same
