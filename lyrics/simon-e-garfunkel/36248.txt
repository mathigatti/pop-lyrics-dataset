Gee, but its great to be back home
Home is where I want to be
I've been on the road so long my friend
That if you came along I know you couldn't disagree
Its the same old story
Everywhere I go I get slandered
Libeled, I hear words I never heard in the bible
And I'm one step ahead of the shoeshine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied


Deputy sheriff said to me
Tell me what you came here for boy
You better get your bags and flee
You're in trouble boy
And now you're heading into more
Its the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered
Libeled
I hear words I never heard in the bible
And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine.
