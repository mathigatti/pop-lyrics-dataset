Why don't you write me 
I'm out in the jungle 
I'm hungry to hear you 
Send me a card 
I am waiting so hard 
To be near you. (La, la, la) 
Why don't you write? 
Something is wrong 
And I know I got to be there 
Maybe I'm lost 
But I can't make the cost 
Of the airfare 


Tell me why 
Why 
Why 
Tell me why 
Why 
Why 

Why don't you write me 
A letter would brighten 
My loneliest evening 
Mail it today 
If it's only to say 
That you're leaving me. (La, la, la) 

Monday morning, sitting in the sun 
Hoping and wishing for the mail to come 
Tuesday, never got a word 
Wednesday, Thursday, ain't no sign 
Drank a half a bottle of iodine 
Friday, woe is me 
Gonna hang my body from the highest tree 
Why don't you write me?
