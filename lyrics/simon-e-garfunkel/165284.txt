I can hear the soft breathing of the girl that I love 
As she lies here beside me, asleep with the night 
And her hair in a fine mist floats on my pillow 
Reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight 


But I've got to creep down the alley way 
Fly down the highway 
Before they come to catch me I'll be gone 
Somewhere they can't find me 

Oh baby, you don't know what I've done 
I've committed a crime, I've broken the law 
While you were here sleeping 
and just dreaming of me 
I held up and robbed a liquor store 

But I've got to creep down the alley way 
Fly down the highway 
Before they come to catch me I'll be gone 
Somewhere they can't find me 

Oh my life seems unreal, my crime an illusion 
A scene badly written in which I must play 
And though it puts me uptight to leave you 
I know it's not right to leave you 
The morning is just a few hours away 

But I've got to creep down the alley way 
Fly down the highway 
Before they come to catch me I'll be gone 
Somewhere they can't find me
