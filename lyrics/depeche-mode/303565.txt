Walk the edge of America.
A concrete beach to scrape my head,
Inside the subway stinking fear and shame becomes the violent
breath.


Vigilantes out on dawn patrol, but now there's nothing left to
hide.
I'm just a number on the metal fence which marks the great
divide.

(sing it)

Hey boy give your dreams a rest, if you're tired of searching..
This is where it ends, there's nothing left to lose nothing to
protest
Learn to love your anger now, anger here is all you possess..
Welcome to the edge


Below the towers of the citadel,
Seems someone overlooked the cost.
Forgotten soldier of paradise, now paradise is lost.

Recognition never realised,
Salvation lost among the crowd.
So tell me here beside the sterile sea where is your nation now?

(we say)


Hey boy give your dreams a rest, if you're tired of searching..
This is where it ends, there's nothing left to lose nothing to
protest
Learn to love your anger now, anger here is all you possess..
Welcome to the edge
