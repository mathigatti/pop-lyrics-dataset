I can't lie
I can't fake
I can't act my handshake
This disclosure I must obey


There is so much love in me

I can't run
I have tried
There's a thorn in my side
There is something I can't hide

There is so much love in me

You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you can't shake me now
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me so

There's a fire in my veins
The desire causes pain
I would say it again
There is so much love in me

You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you can't shake me now
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me so

There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
