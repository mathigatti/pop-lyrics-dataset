Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one


Experiences have a lasting impression
But words once spoken
Don't mean a lot now
Belief is the way
The way of the innocent
And when I say innocent
I should say naive

So lie to me
But do it with sincerity
Make me listen
Just for a minute
Make me think
There's some truth in it

Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one

Promises made for convenience
Aren't necessarily
What we need
Truth is a word
That's lost its meaning
The truth has become
Merely half-truth

So lie to me
Like they do it in the factory
Make me think
That at the end of the day
Some great reward
Will be coming my way

Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one
