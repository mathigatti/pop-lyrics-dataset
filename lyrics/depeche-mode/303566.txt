Enter newborn players and gather, weigh their innocence
Only the brightest shine but not forever.
Many lights die, many tears rain,
When those tears run dry, on a mountain madness day.


You were just in time for a foolish deal, for love I sold -
I can't stand another howling day inside this empty skin.
While the becons burn I'll say
Await return from so far away..

One life, with the devil do I play
For so long, El Diablo is to blame
Oh..Oh..Oh..

Oh EL Diablo, El Diablo won't you sell me back my soul

Oh EL Diablo, El Diablo won't you sell me back my soul

Wedding is on the wind does she blow my way?
She can dance and she can sing, she will tear your heart away.
While the promise burns I'll stay
And will you return from so far away?


One life within the devil do I play
It's been so long, El Diablo is to blame

One life with the devil do I play
For so long, El Diablo is to blame

One life, but the devil is in my ways
Oh..Oh..Oh
