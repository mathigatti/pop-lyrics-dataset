You can see them running through me baby 
You can see the lights in their eyes 
You can see the masses raising me 
And I'm preaching them more lies 
I'm just a mass'form communication 
I sell what everyone buys 
You know my appearance is changing 
Changing for modern times 


I'm just a television set 
I'm just a television set 
I'm just a television set 

Well you can have me in bed if you want me 
Just plug me into your wall 
And I'll give you sex if you want it 
Or I'll give you nothing at all 
You can have me' babe' for good times 
You can have me' babe' for bad 
Keep me running all of your life and 
I'll return your instant demand 

I'm just a television set 
I'm just a television set 
I'm just a television set 

Did you see them running through me baby 
Did you see the lights in their eyes 
Did you see the masses raising me 
Am I preaching them more lies" 
I'm just a mass form communication 
I sell what everyone buys 
You know my appearance is changing 
Changing for modern times 

I'm just a television set 
I'm just a television set 
I'm just a television set
