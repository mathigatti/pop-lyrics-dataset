It's the dark night of my soul
And temptation's taking hold
But through the pain and the suffering
Through the heartache and trembling
 
I feel loved
I feel loved
 
As the darkness closes in
In my head I hear whispering
Questioning and beckoning
But I'm not taken in
 
I feel loved
I feel loved
 
From the depths of my emptiness
Comes a feeling of inner bliss
I feel wanted, I feel desired
I can feel my soul on fire
 
I feel loved
I feel loved
