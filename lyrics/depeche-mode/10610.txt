Laying on your holy bed
by the hallowed door
Feeling like an infidel
Not worthy of your call
Tempted by your innocence
Beckoned to my fate
I won't face the consequence
I wouldn't hesitate


I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture
Rushing through my veins
Passion
Flaming
In my heart
Heavenly surrender once again
Yeah

Shackled like an animal
Chained to my desires
Just another sacrifice
To love's eternal fight
Tame me with your tenderness
And break my brittle heart
Easily and elegantly
Tear my world apart

I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture
Rushing through my veins
Passion
Flaming
In my heart
Heavenly surrender once again
Yeah

We're living in a world full of illusion
Everything is so unreal
My mind is in a state of confusion
But I can't deny the way I feel

I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture
Rushing through my veins
Yeah
