Put up the barriers
Shut down your senses
Cover up with all of your pretences
See no evil
Your eyes are blunted
We are the hunters
We are the hunted
 
Place it in your memory
Leave it in your past
But don't forget
 
Taking a tumble
I'm taking a dive
Sometimes I stumble when my mind's made up
Reaction levels
Seem strangely muted
Ordinary acts of fun have been diluted
 
Place it in your memory
Leave it in your past
But don't forget
