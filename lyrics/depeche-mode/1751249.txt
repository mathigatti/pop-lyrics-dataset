One subtle look
God help me
Is all it took
To sell me
One single word
Unspoken
Your name unheard
And I'm broken


The sun and the moon
and the stars in the sky are laughing
They've seen it all before
For the wind in the trees
and the waves on the seas
It's the same thing
They can't take any more

One gentle touch
And I'm helpless
It's all too much
For my senses
One simple prayer
Denied me
When you're not there
Beside me

The sun and the moon
and the stars in the sky are laughing
They've seen it all before
For the wind in the trees
and the waves on the seas
It's the same thing
They can't take any more
