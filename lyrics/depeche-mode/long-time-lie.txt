It's been a while since you did something
Not so long since you complained
You sit around and doing nothing
Every day


You're the coward who points the finger
I understand that I'm helping you
You have delusions in some space-out fantasy
That's what you do

He loves to wallow in the glory
Loves to cut you down to size
Try to make you believe in all of his lies

It's been a long long long long long long time
It's been a long long long long long long time
A long time lie

Don't you never look in the mirror
Don't you know there'se so much more
Locked up inside that box behind your door

All your twisted conversations
When you're sitting all alone
Just remember we know your secret
While you moan

He loves to wallow in the glory
Loves to cut you down to size
Try to make you believe in all his lies

It's been a long long long long long long time
It's been a long long long long long long time
A long time lie
