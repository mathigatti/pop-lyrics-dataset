La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la loo


Didn't no one tell you
Money is the game
You're playing so hard to get now
I don't even know your name

Don't play with me, I've nothing to lose Khanada, I'll get by
It ain't no ones day, coming so soon Khanada, I'll get by
I dont believe in dragons or blues Khanada, I'll get by
I don't believe in nobody's rules Khanada, I'll get by

Heavy as the rain falls
I might go outside
Just because you're with me
Doesn't mean you're not the same
