There's a fragile tension
That's keeping us going
It may not last forever
But always is flowing


It's something magical in the air
Something so tragic we have to care

There's a strange obsession
It's drawing us nearer
We don't understand it
It never gets clearer

It's something mystical in our dreams
It's so simplistic it kicks and screams

Oh well, we'll seem to reek
On the edge of collapse
Nothing can keep us down

There's a dizzying feeling
That's keeping us flying
Through glittering gauntlet
Without even trying

It's something radical in our hands
But nothing logical to our plans
