Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


Why I see your face
Moving in the aerospace
White Light shining, we're all alone
Scare of flying, cos here we come

White light, homing in
The speed of light, moving in
Faster than light (the light)
Faster than light (the light)
Faster than light..
Faster than light (the light)
Faster than light (the light)
Faster than light..


Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You see ways by the door
Pulling over years before
White light shining bright, you're all alone
Scare of flying, cos here we come

(chorus)


Light Light Light Light Light
Light Light Light Light Light
Light Light Light Light Light

(chorus)
