Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?
Will you take the pain I'll give to you again and again?
Will you return it?


There'll be times when my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life liveable

But when you think I've had enough
From your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverfull
Yes, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

There'll be days when I'll stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach

I'm not trying to say I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn
When you've got something to teach
And I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Pain
Will you return it?
I'll say it again, pain

Pain
Will you return it?
I won't say it again

Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?
