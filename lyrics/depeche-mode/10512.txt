When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough


We walk together
We're walking down the street
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
Everytime I think of you
I know we have to meet
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
It's getting hotter, it's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
You're like an angel and you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough
