Here is a song
From the wrong side of town
Where I'm bound
To the ground
By the loneliest sound
That pounds from within
And is pinning me down


Here is a page
From the emptiest stage
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid

And I thank you
For bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found
That I belong here

The heat and the sickliest
Sweet smelling sheets
That cling to the backs of my knees
And my feet
But I'm drowning in time
To a desperate beat

And I thank you
For bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found
That I belong

Feels like home
I should have known
From my first breath

God send the only true friend
I call mine
Pretend that I'll make amends
The next time
Befriend the glorious end of the line

And I thank you
For bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found
That I belong here
