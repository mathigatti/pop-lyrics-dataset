In a manner of speaking
I just want to say
That I could never forget the way
You told me everything
By saying nothing
In a manner of speaking
I don't understand
How love in silence becomes reprimand
But the way I feel about you
Is beyond words
 
Oh give me the words
Give me the words
That tell me nothing
Oh give me the words
Give me the words
That tell me everything
 
In a manner of speaking
Semantics won't do
In this life that we live
We only make do
And the way that we feel
Might have to be sacrificed
 
So in a manner of speaking
I just want to say
That like you I should find a way
To tell you everything
By saying nothing
 
Oh give me the words
Give me the words
That tell me nothing
Oh give me the words
Give me the words
Give me the words
Give me the words
Give me the words
