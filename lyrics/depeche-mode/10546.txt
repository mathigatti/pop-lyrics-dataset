I am happy that I have you
Even though you're not here now
I know somewhere you are dreaming
Though it's definitely not of me


It doesn't matter if this all shatters
Nothing lasts forever
But I'm praying
That we're staying together

I am warmed by your friendship
Even when you're far away
And I'm happy in the knowledge
We may never see the day

When I kiss you &amp; you kiss me
Don't pretend you miss me
The worst kind of diseased mind
Is one filled with jealousy

If we should meet again
Don't try to solve the puzzle
Just lay down next to me
And please don't move a muscle

I will thank you, most of all, for
The respect you have for me
I'm embarrassed; it overwhelms me
Because I don't deserve any

I doesn't matter if this all shatters
Nothing lasts for ever
But I'm praying
That we're staying together
