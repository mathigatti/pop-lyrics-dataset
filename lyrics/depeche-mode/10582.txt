Working week's come to its end
party time is here again
everyone can come if they want to
if you want to be with me
if you want to be with me
you can come with me if you want to


Exercise your basic right
we could build a building site
from the bricks of shame is built the hope
if you want to be with me
if you want to be with me
even though you may still not want to

Let tomorrow and today
bring a life of ecstasy
wipe away your tears of confusion
if you want to be with me
if you want to be with me
you can come with me if you want to
even though you still may not want to
