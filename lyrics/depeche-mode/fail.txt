People, do we call this trying?
We're hopeless, forget the denying
Our souls are corrupt
Our minds are messed up
Our consciences, bankrupt
Oh, we're fucked


People, what are we thinking?
It's shameful, our standards are sinking
We're barely hanging on
Our spirit has gone
And once where it shone
I hear a lonesome song

People, how are we coping?
It's futile to even to even start hoping
That justice will prevail
That truth will tip the scales
Our dignity has sailed
Oh, we've failed
