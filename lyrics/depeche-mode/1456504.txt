They call you Jezebel
Whenever we walk in
You're going straight to hell
For wanton acts of sin
They say
And that I'll have to pay
But I need you
Just this way


They call you Jezebel
For what you like to wear
You're morally unwell
They say you'll never care for me
But what they fail to see
Is that your games are the key

Open their eyes to the beauty
Open their hearts to the fun
Open their minds to the idea
That you don't own someone

They call you Jezebel
Whenever men walk by
They say that they can tell
The longing in your eyes is real
And how you really feel
But they can't see your appeal

Jezebel
