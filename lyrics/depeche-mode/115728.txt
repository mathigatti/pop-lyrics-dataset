I saw you in the picture
I saw you play the part
This ain't nodisco
There's a thousand watts in you
You take this too far
This ain't nodisco
 
Sometimes when I wonder if you're taking a chance
This ain't nodisco
And you know how to dance
 
Move me disco
Baby don't you let go
This ain't nodisco
 
Part one
Act one
Everyone pretend
This ain't nodisco
This is more a story
And we're reaching the end
This ain't nodisco
.  
Always makes me happy when you're taking a chance
This ain't nodisco
And you know how to dance
 
Move me disco
Baby don't you let go
This ain't nodisco
