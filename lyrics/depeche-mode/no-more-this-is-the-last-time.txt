One more ride I can't explain
Our hesitation
We stop and start again
Repeat the process
We repeat the lie
Time and time again
By and by


This is the last time
I say goodbye
The last time
Then we won't have to lie
The last time
Called it what you want
You don't mean a thing to me no more

You go your way, I'll go mine
We walked this line together for the longest time
We climbed the mountain in so many ways
Reached the top and slowly fade away

This is the last time
I say goodbye
The last time
Then we won't have to lie
The last time
Called it what you want
You don't mean a thing to me no more

Our crimes will pass us by
Crimes, we all fade to die
All those memories, all our pain
Slowly disappear like falling rain

This is the last time
I say goodbye
The last time
Then we won't have to lie
The last time
(All those memories, all our pain)
This is the last time
(All those memories, all our pain)
The last time
