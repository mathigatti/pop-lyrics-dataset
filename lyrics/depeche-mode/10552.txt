Sea of Sin I'm swimming in and I'm taking a dive
My mind's in need so my body feeds and it keeps me alive
It gets better and better as it gets wetter and wetter
Sea of Sin know where you've been but I don't care


Sea of Sin through thick and thin for better or worse
My mind's in need so my body feeds and it quenches my thirst
You look cheaper and cheaper as we sink deeper and deeper
Sea of Sin know where you've been 'cause I've been there

Here under God's sky
His watchful eye
And all of the lies
My consolation prize

Sea of Sin my second skin my home from home
When I'm in doubt my hands reach out and I'm never alone
It gets wetter and wetter as it gets better and better
Sea of Sin know where you've been and I'm prepared
Sea of Sin know where you've been yes I'm aware
Sea of Sin know where you've been 'cause I've been there
Sea of Sin know where you've been and I don't care
Sea of Sin know where you've been and I don't care
