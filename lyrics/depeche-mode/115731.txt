Get that feeling
Head is reeling
You think you're in control
But you don't know me babe
I can move you
I can soothe you
I can take you places in a different way
 
I don't think you understand
What I'm trying to say
I'll be your operator baby
I'm in control
 
Watch your action
Close reaction
And everything you're thinking babe inside your head
Conversation, my creation
Nothing that you do
You do unless I said
 
You don't know the consequences
Of the things you say
I'll be your operator baby
I'm in control
 
All the things you tried to do babe
And all the words we said before
Are only part of what I started baby
And you can't stop me anymore
