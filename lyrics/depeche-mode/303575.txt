All babies together
Ev'ry one a seed
Half of us are satisfied
The other half of us in need
Love's bountiful in us
Tarnished by our greed


Oh, when will there be a harvest.. for the world?
(Harvest for the world)


A nations planted
So concerned with gain
As the seasons come and go, we won't wait in vain
Far too many, feelin' the strain

(chorus)

(A harvest.. A harvest)
(A harvest.. A harvest)
(A harvest.. A harvest)
(A harvest.. A harvest)
(A harvest for the world)


Dress me up for battle
When all I want is peace
Those of us who pay the price
Come home with the least
And nation after nation, tuning into beasts

(chorus)

When will there be.. a harvest
When will there be.. a harvest
When will there be.. a harvest
When will there be.. a harvest
When will there be.. a harvest
When will there be.. a harvest
When will there be.. a harvest..
