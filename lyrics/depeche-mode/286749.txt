Wine is sweet and gin is bitter 
Drink all you can but you won't forget her 
You talk too much' you laugh too loud 
You see her face in every crowd 


That's the price of love' the price of love 
A debt you pay with tears and pain 
The price of love' the price of love 
It costs you more when you're to blame 

Kiss one girl' kiss another 
Kiss them all but you won't recover 
You're dancing slow' you're dancing fast 
You're happy now' but that won't last 

That's the price of love' the price of love 
A debt you pay with tears and pain 
The price of love' the price of love 
It costs you more when you're to blame
