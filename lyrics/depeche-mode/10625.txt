All I wanna do is see you again
Is that too much to ask for?
I just want to see your sweet smile,
Smiled the way it was before
Well I try not to hold you
And I'll try not to kiss you
And I won't even touch you.


All I wanna du is see you
Don't you know that it's true.

I remember the days when we walked trough
the woods,
We'd sit on a bench for a while.
I treasure the way we used to laugh and play
And look in each others eyes.
You can keep me at a distance if you don't
trust my resistance.
But I swear I won't touch you.
Well I know five years is a long time and that times
change
But I think that you'll find people are basically
the same

If the water's still flowing we can go for a swim
And do the things we used to do.
And if I'm reluctant you can pull me in,
We can relive our youth.

But we'll just stay friendly like sister and brother
Though I think I still love you.
