Have I got a soft touch?
Have I got a soft touch?
Is my radar that off?
Is my radar that off?


I'm thinking if you're sinking
Then I'll drown
I've got a confession
Your depression will take me down

Am I on the right track?
Am I on the right track?
Have I picked a bad time?
Have I picked a bad time?

It's seeming that you're dreaming through my eyes
Why protest when your success is my prize

Oh brother, give me a helping hand
Oh brother, tell me you understand

Have I hit a raw nerve?
Have I hit a raw nerve?

Have I got a soft touch?
Have I got a soft touch?

I'm thinking if you're sinking
Then I'll drown
I've got a suspicion that your position is unsound

Oh brother, give me a helping hand
Oh brother, tell me you understand

Have I hit a raw nerve?
Have I hit a raw nerve?

Have I got a soft touch?
Have I got a soft touch?

Have I hit a raw nerve?
Have I hit a raw nerve?

Have I got a soft touch?
Have I got a soft touch?
