Condemnation
Tried
Here on the stand
With the book in my hand
And truth on my side


Accusations
Lies
Hand me my sentence
I'll show no repentance
I'll suffer with pride

If for honesty
You want apologies
I don't sympathize
If for kindness
You substitute blindness
Please, open your eyes

Condemnation
Why?
Because my duty
Was always to beauty
And that was my crime

Feel elation
High
To know I can trust this
Fix of injustice
Time after time

If you see purity
As immaturity
Well, it's no surprise
If for kindness
You substitute blindness
Please, open your eyes
