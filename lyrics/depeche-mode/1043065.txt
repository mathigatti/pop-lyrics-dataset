What are you hiding from
You are part of the sum
What has been going on
Your confidence has gone
 
You have seen better days
You have lived better ways
 
What are you waiting for
Answers that question more
Unexpected they will come
Are you expecting some
 
You have seen better days
You have lived better ways
 
Only time will tell
What will come of you
Only crime could sell
What you're trying to
 
Where are you heading to
What plans will you pull through
With trouble in the wings
Will you risk anything
 
You have seen better days
You have lived better ways
