They were raining from the sky
Exploding in my heart
Is this a love in disguise
Or just a form of modern art


From the skies you could almost hear them cry
Tora Tora Tora
In the town they were going down
Tora Tora Tora

I had a nightmare only yesterday
You played a skeleton
You took my love then died that day
I played an American

From the skies you can almost hear them cry
Tora! Tora! Tora!
In the town they were going down
Tora! Tora! Tora!

I played an American
