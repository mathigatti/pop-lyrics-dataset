Summer time it's supposed to bring out the best in eveybody 
But here I lie, waiting for my phone to ring, 
Man, I could be anybody. 
and I wonder, don't you wonder what is my intention 
and if I could ever really truly make you happy 



If it's not enough to keep me hanging around 
I'm such a flake boy
When the morning comes, 
I could be running away 
Just like your dream boys 


Send this dream back to yesterday,
I don't have the face for tomorrow
Lonley yawning, sleepy this way
Lead me through the trees to your hollow 
and i wonder, cos I wonder if i'm gonna lose all this loving
that I feel 
cos if it could ever really truly make me happy 


If it's not enough to keep me hanging around 
I'm such a flake boy 
When the morning comes, 
I could be running away 
Just like your dream boys


I don't want to be your dream boy 


Don't make your dream boy


I'm not your dream
