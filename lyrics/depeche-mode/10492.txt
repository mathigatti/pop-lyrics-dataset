To the soul's desires
The body listens
What the flesh requires
Keeps the heart imprisoned
 
What the spirit seeks
The mind will follow
When the body speaks
All else is hollow
 
I'm just an angel
Driving blindly
Through this world
 
I'm just a slave here
At the mercy
Of a girl
 
Oh I need your tenderness
Oh I need your touch
Oh I dream of one caress
Oh I pray too much
 
To the soul's desires
The body listens
What the flesh requires
Keeps the heart imprisoned
 
What the spirit seeks
The mind will follow
When the body speaks
All else is hollow
 
You keep me waiting
For the promise
That is mine
 
Please stop debating
Please stop wasting
Your time
 
Oh I need your tenderness
Oh I need your touch
Oh I dream of one caress
Oh I pray too much
