Set me free
 
Remotivate me
Set me burning
After years in deep freeze
My body is yearning
For a new lease on life
Add a little spice
 
Set me free
Remotivate me
 
Give me a reason
To scream and shout
Give me something
To get excited about
When everything is looking dull
I'm sure it isn't impossible to
 
Set me free
Remotivate me
 
Don't think I'm impatient
Because I'm willing to wait
But something must happen
Before it gets too late
It could be my imagination
But wasn't there more than this numb sensation
 
Set me free
Remotivate me
 
Set me free
