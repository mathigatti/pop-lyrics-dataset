If you want control
Without any pain
How long will you suffer?
How long will you reign


You see the friend that I knew?
Cannot be found
Replaced by another
Wearing his crown

Theres a place where I go
Without any sound
Only you can reach me
Only youre allowed

And youre so far away
Youre so far from here
Do you remember
Our time without tears?

When youre falling
I will catch you
You dont have to fall that far
You can make it
I will be there
You were broken from the start

When you were a child
You'd dream all day long
You'd dream of the future
Get lost in your songs

Now that time is gone
Its lost for you now
Words long forgotten
Forgotten somehow

When youre falling
I will catch you
You dont have to fall that far
You can make it
I will be there
You were broken from the start

When youre falling
I will catch you
You dont have to fall that far
You can make it
I will be there
You were broken from the start

When youre falling
I will catch you
You dont have to fall that far
You can make it
I will be there
You were broken from the start
