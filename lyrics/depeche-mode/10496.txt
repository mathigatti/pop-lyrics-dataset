Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in
And Sliding out
Of conscious feeling
 
Take a light
Start the flame
Play the game
I am lost
In your eyes
Hypnotised
Here I believe
Dreams never deceive
 
Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in
And sliding out
Life has no meaning
 
Bodies move
Colours change
Girl you're strange
Here inside
I'm at home
I'm alive
 
Don't be afraid
I'm floating away
 
Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in
And sliding out
Of conscious feeling
 
Comatose, almost
 
Comatose, almost
 
Comatose.
