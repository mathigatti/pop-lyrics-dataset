Saturday night' you look so chic 
Been waiting for this moment' been waiting all week 
The pub is crowded' much too hot 
The boys' they're dancing' they just can't stop 


Tomorrow's dance' tomorrow's dance 
You dance your dance' you dance your chance 
Tomorrow's dance' tomorrow's dance 
You dance with pride and you dance with pride 

Ice cold drinks' get sold tonight 
We're gonna get happy' the occasion is right 
You start to move' you take the floor 
The music is better than ever before 

Tomorrow's dance' tomorrow's dance 
You dance your dance' you dance your chance 
Tomorrow's dance' tomorrow's dance 
You dance with pride and you dance with pride 

3 AM' I just can't last 
The music is loud and much too fast 
You cannot get out' you wanna stay 
You gotta hang out' another dancing day 

Tomorrow's dance' tomorrow's dance 
You dance your dance' you dance your chance 
Tomorrow's dance' tomorrow's dance 
You dance with pride and you dance with pride
