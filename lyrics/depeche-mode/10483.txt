People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully


So we're different colours, and we're different creeds
And different people have different needs
It's obvious you hate me, though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you, so what could I have done?

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully

Now you're punching and you're kicking and you're shouting atme
I'm relying on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced, but I'm sure it exists
It just take a while to travel from your head to your fist

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
