I like it' I like it 
I like the way you run your fingers through my hair 
And I love the way you tickle my chin 
And I like the way you let yourself in when your mommy's not there 
I like it' I like it 
I like the things you say and all the things you do 
And I like the way you straighten my tie 
And I like the way you're winking your eye 
And I know I like you 
And I know I like you 


Do that again 
You're driving me insane 
Kiss me once more 
That's another thing I like you for 
I like it' I like it 
I like the funny feelings when I'm with you 
And I like you more with every day 
And I like to always hearing you say you're liking it too 
You're liking it too 

Do that again 
You're driving me insane 
Kiss me once more 
That's another thing I like you for 

I like it' I like it 
I like the funny feelings when I'm with you 
With every day 
And I like to always hearing you say you're liking it too 
You're liking it too 

Whoa' I like it 
Are you liking it too
