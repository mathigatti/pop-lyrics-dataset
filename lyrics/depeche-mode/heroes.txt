I
I will be King
And you
You will be my Queen
Though nothing
Will keep us together
We can beat them
Forever and ever
We can be Heroes
Just for one day


And you
You can be mean
And I
I'll drink all the time
’Cause we're Lovers
And that is a fact
Yes we're Lovers
And that is that

Though nothing
Will keep us together
We can beat them
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
Just for one day

I
Well I wish I could swim
Like the dolphins
Like dolphins can swim

Though nothing
Will drive them away
We can beat them
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
Forever and ever
What d`you say?

And I
I would be King
And you
Would be my Queen
Oh, nothing can keep us together
We can beat them
Forever and ever
We can be Heroes
Just for one day

So I
I can remember (I remember)
Standing
By the wall (By the wall)
And the guns
Shot above our heads (All around us)
And we kissed
As though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

And the shame
It`s there on the other side
Oh, we can beat them
Forever and ever
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
What d`you say?

We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes

Oh, nothing
Will keep us together
Maybe we’re lying
Then you better not stay
We can be Heroes
Just for one day

(O o ohhh o)
We can be Heroes
(O o ohhh o)
Just for one day
(O o ohhh o)
Just for one day...
