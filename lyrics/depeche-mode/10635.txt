Well I'm knocking on Death's door
Will I take my rest
Among the blessed?


Mother are you waiting?
Father are you pacing?
I'm coming home

I'm knocking on Death's door
Will I take my rest
In my sunday best?

Mother are you anxious?
Father are you gracious?
I'm coming home

I've been away too long
For so long it was strong
I've been away too long
I know that it was wrong
But I'm coming home

Well I'm knocking on Death's door
Will I take my rest?
Have I passed the test?

Mother are you praying?
Father I'm saying
I'm coming home
