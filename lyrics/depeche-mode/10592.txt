Naked
Skin on skin
Tears are falling
Tears of joy
Her first boy
His first girl
Makes a change


In a world full of nothing
Though it's not love
It means something

She's lonely
And he says
It's for her only
That he lusts
She doesn't trust him
Nothing is true
But he will do

In a world full of nothing
Though it's not love
It means something

It's easy to slip away
And believe it all

Though it's not love
It means something
