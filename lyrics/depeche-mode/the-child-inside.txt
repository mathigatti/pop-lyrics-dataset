There is darkness and death in your eyes
What have you got buried inside
The shallow grave in your soul
The ghosts that have taken control
You really should have dug a little deeper there
Bodyparts are starting to appear and scare
The child inside away


Each tear that flows down your face
Trickles then picks up the pace
And turns to a river inside
A river that will not subside
I can hear that dreadful overflowing sound
Watching from afar I see a child is drowned
The child inside your heart

I can see you drifting away
Heading for the light
I can see you drifting away
Every night

Why were you always inside
On days when the weather was fine
And while we were running around
You were nowhere to be found
You know you should have taken all your dolls to bed
But you were made to play games with your soul instead
The child inside you died
