My little light
Is going to shine
Shine out so bright
And illuminate your mind


My little soul
Will leave a footprint

This little voice
Is going to sing
I have no choice
It will infinitely ring

My little soul
Will leave a footprint

I'm channeling the universe
It's focusing its love inside of me
A Singularity

My little words
Are going to sting
Haven't you heard
The pain and joy they bring

My little soul
Will leave a footprint

I'm channeling the universe
It's focusing its love inside of me
A singularity

Your little eyes
They're going to see
I can't disguise
The beauty inside me

My little soul
Will leave a footprint
