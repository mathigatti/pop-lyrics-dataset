If I could just hide
The sinner inside
And keep him denied
How sweet life would be
If I could be free
From the sinner in me


I'll never be a saint
That's not a picture that your memory paints
Not renowned for my patience
I'm not renowned for my restraint
But you're always around
You can always be found
To pick me up when I'm on the ground

If I could just hide
The sinner inside
And keep him denied
How sweet life would be
If I could be free
From the sinner in me

I'm still recovering
Still getting over all the suffering
More known for my anger
Than for any other thing
But you've always tried
To be by my side
And catch my fall when I start to slide

If I could just hide
The sinner inside
And keep him denied
How sweet life would be
If I could be free
From the sinner in me
