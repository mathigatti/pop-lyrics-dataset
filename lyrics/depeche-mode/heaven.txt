Sometimes I slide away silently
I slowly lose myself, over and over
Take comfort in my skin, endlessly
Surrender to my will, forever and ever


I dissolve in trust
I will sing with joy
I will end up dust
I'm in heaven

I stand in golden rays, radiantly
I burn a fire of love, over and over
Reflecting endless light, relentlessly
I have embraced the flame, forever and ever

I will scream a word
Jump into the void
I will guide the world
Up to heaven
