Newborn
For the first time
I'm not born again
I have never lived at all
I've opened up my eyes
Now I hear the world talking
Opened up my eyes
I've just started walking
I've just started walking


I've got someone who cares for me
Someone who believes in me
I've got someone understanding me
Someone crying over me
For all the right reasons
For all the right reasons

Newborn
For the first time
I'm not born again
I have never lived at all
I've opened up my eyes
Now I hear the world talking
Opened up my eyes
I've just started walking
I've just started walking

I've got someone seeing grace in me
Someone respecting me
I've got someone who's there for me
Someone saying prayers for me
For all the right reasons
For all the right reasons
