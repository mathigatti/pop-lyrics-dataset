She was silent trying to be
Like the girl who acted on the TV
Always knowing when to say
Wishing for a moment so that they could see
 
Staring in the night
A picture in my room
And I think that she knew her lines
 
Break away tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We've got to get it right
We've got to understand
 
Carefully watching waiting as I
Stood upon the back streets and we start to play
I was screaming louder as the
Curtains fall between us in a twisted way
 
Staring in the night
A picture in my room
And I think that she knew her lines
 
Break away tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We've got to get it right
We've got to understand
 
Placing all the questions in the
Minutes of a game we won so long ago
Dangerous and beautiful the
Radio transmission that I have to know
 
You could never run
You could never stay
And I think you belong to me
 
Break away tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We've got to get it right
We've got to understand
