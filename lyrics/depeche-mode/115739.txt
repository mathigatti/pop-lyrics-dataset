You turned me away
Away from your actions
Forced by the violence
That always surrounds you
 
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd
 
You burnt yourself out
In that silence
I have to tell you
I ache for you still
The sound of my words
Is always so shocking
They get much louder
Each time I speak
 
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd
 
Signals of progress
We're growing much older
I'm afraid that I'll leave
And my ache never goes
 
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd
