I've been a martyr for love
And I will die in the flames
As I draw my last breathe
As I close in on death
I will call out your name


I've been a martyr for love
Nailed up on the cross
While your having your fun
As the damage is done
I'm assessing the cost

I knew what I was letting myself in for
I knew that I could never even the score

I've been a martyr for love
I need to be by your side
I have knelt at your feet
I have felt your deceit
Couldn't leave if I tried

I've been a martyr for love
Tortured every hour
From the day I was born I've been moved like a pawn
By the greatest of powers

I knew that I would have to suffer in vain
Aware that I would never out grow the pain

I've been a martyr for love
