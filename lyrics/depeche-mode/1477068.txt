I'm the ghost in your house
Calling your name
My memory lingers
You'll never be the same
I'm the hole in your heart
I'm the stain in your bed
The phantom in your fingers
The voices in your head


One touch is all it took
To draw you in
To leave you hooked
One kiss, you paid the price
You had a taste
Of paradise

Now you're running in circles
Chasing imaginary footsteps
Reaching for shadows
In the bed where I once slept

I'm the ghost in your house
Calling your name
My memory lingers
You'll never be the same
I'm the hole in your heart
I'm the stain in your bed
The phantom in your fingers
The voices in your head

One thought is all it takes
You lose control
You make mistakes
This pain will never leave
Until I die
You'll always grieve

Now you're falling to pieces
Seeing my face wherever you go
Talking to strangers
From a place they'll never know
