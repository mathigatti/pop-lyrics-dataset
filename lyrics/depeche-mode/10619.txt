Don't know the reason why I
Think I've been here before
This place seems so familiar
But then I can't be sure
Here comes that time again when
You'll walk right out the door
Don't tell me secrets anymore


And fools don't run away
You'll be followed another day
And all the chances that fall your way
Are in the fire on your dying day
So call me now and tell me that you're home

Can't see the sense in crying
There's too many tears to fall
My thoughts are multiplying
So I'll try to save them all
