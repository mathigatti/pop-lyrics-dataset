I was there when you needed me most
I was there when you wanted me least
I was your father, your son and your Holy Ghost and priest


Through your failures and success
Through your losses and gains
I didn't see much happiness or pain

I couldn't save your soul
I couldn't even take you home
I couldn't fill that hole
Alone

I saw you at your best
I knew you at your worst
I couldn't tell if you were blessed or cursed
There's a thin grey line
Between the black and the white
It's evidently hard to find at night

I couldn't save your soul
I couldn't even take you home
I couldn't play that role
Alone

Now it's too
Too late for
Words that should've have been said long ago

I was there when you needed me most
I was there when you wanted me least
I was your father, your son and your Holy Ghost and priest

I couldn't save your soul
I couldn't even take you home
I couldn't fill that hole
Alone
