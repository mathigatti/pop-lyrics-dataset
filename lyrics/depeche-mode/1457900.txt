Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me


I'm leaving bitterness behind
This time I'm cleaning up my mind
There is no space for the regrets
I will remember to forget

Just look at me
I am walking of incoming
Look at the frequencies of which I vibrate
I'm going to light up the world

Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me

I'm leaving anger in the past
With all the shadows that it caused
There is a radar in my heart
I should have trusted from the start

Just look at me
I am a living act of holiness
Giving all the positive virtues that I possess
I'm going to light up the world

Peace will come to me
(Just wait and see )
Peace will come to me
(It's ment to be)
Peace will come to me
(Just wait and see)
Peace will come to me
It's inevitability
