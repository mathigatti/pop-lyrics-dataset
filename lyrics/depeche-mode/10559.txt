My secret garden's not so secret anymore
Run from the house holding my head in my hands
Feeling dejected, feeling like a child might feel
It all seems so absurd that this should have occurred
My very only secret and I had to go and leak it
My secret garden's not so secret anymore


No, my secret garden's not so secret anymore
Run through the fields down to the edge of the water
Can't stay long, here comes the reason why
She'll catch me if she can, take me by the hand
I'll have to keep on running and I just can't see the fun in
My secret garden not being secret anymore

It used to be so easy on days such as these she'd
Search and search for hours, in among the flowers

I loved it, I loved her

Play the fool, act so cruel (I loved it)
Read her book, take a look (I loved her)
Play the fool, act so cruel (I loved it)
Read her book, take a look (I loved her)

It all seems so absurd that this should have occurred
My very only secret and I had to go and leak it
My secret garden's not so secret anymore
