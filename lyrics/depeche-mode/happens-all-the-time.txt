No need to feel ashamed
There's nothing to be gained
When your dreams are in the past


Like stars we crush and burn
Only to return
Life goes by so fast

So who is left to play
Nothing's quite the same
We can't live in the past

I'm burning inside as the sun
And I only just begun
Love it fades so fast

Sometimes I forget all I will regret
When I leave this world behind
And sometimes I'm not sure
What I'm fighting for
It happens all the time

I know I've had enough, maybe far too much
It's easy to be kind
And when it's just me and you
I know what I have to do
I can leave this world behind

No need to feel ashamed
And nothing to be gained
When your dreams are in the past

Like stars we crush and burn
Only to return
These lines are change so fast

Sometimes I forget all I will regret
When I leave this world behind
And sometimes I'm not sure
What I'm fighting for
It happens all the time
It happens all the time
It happens all the time
