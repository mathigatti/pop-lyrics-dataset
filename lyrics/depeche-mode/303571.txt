Well you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black, 
Don't look back, 
And I love you, 
You're dirty and sweet oh yeah
Well you're slim and you're weak
You got the teeth 
Of the hydra upon you
You're dirty sweet 
And you're my girl


Get it on..
Bang a gong.. get it on
Get it on..
Bang a gong.. get it on


You're built like a car
You got a hubcap Diamond star halo
You're built like a truck, oh my
You're an untamed youth
That's the truth
With your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty sweet And you're my girl

(chorus)

(chorus)

Well you're windy and wild
You got the blues -
I'm in your shoes and your stockings
You're windy and wild, oh yeah

You're built like a car
You got a hubcap -
Diamond star halo
You're dirty sweet
And you're my girl

(chorus)

Get it on!

Get it on!..

Bang a gong!..

(chorus)
