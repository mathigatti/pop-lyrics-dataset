Overflowing senses
Heightened awareness
I hear my blood flow
I feel its caress
Whispering cosmos
Talking right to me
Unlimited, endless
God breathing through me


See the microcosm
In macrovision
Our bodies moving
With pure precision
One universal
Celebration
One evolution
One creation

Thundering rhythm
Pounding within me
Driving me onwards
Forcing me to see
Clear and enlightening
Right there before me
Brilliantly shining
Intricate beauty

See the microcosm
In macrovision
Our bodies moving
With pure precision
One universal
Celebration
One evolution
One creation

(Chorus repeats)
