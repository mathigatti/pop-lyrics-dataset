Here
As I sit
At this empty cafe
Thinking of you
 
I remember
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again
 
Though the world
Is my oyster
It's only a shell
Full of memories
 
Here by the Seine
Notre-Dame casts
A long lonely shadow
 
Now only sorrow
No tomorrow
There's no today for us
 
Nothing is there
For us to share
But yesterday
 
This is my song
This is my song
This is my song
 
These cities may change
But there always remains
My obsession
 
Through silken waters
My gondola glides
And the bridge
it sighs
 
I remember
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again
 
There's no more time for us
Nothing is there
For us to share
But yesterdays
 
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again
 
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again
 
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again
