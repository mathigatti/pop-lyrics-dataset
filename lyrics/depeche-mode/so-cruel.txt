We crossed the line
Who pushed who over
It doesn't matter to you
It matters to me


We're cut adrift
But still floating
I'm only hanging on
To watch you go down
My love

I disappeared in you
You disappeared from me
I gave you everything you ever wanted
It wasn't what you wanted

The men who love you, you hate the most
They pass right through you like a ghost
They look for you but your spirit is in the air
Baby, you're nowhere

Oh, love
You say in love there are no rules
Oh, love
Sweetheart
You're so cruel

Desperation is a tender trap
It gets you every time
You put your lips to her lips
To stop the lie

Her skin is pale like God's only dove
Screams like an angel for your love
Then she makes you watch her from above
And you need her like a drug

Oh, love
You say in love there are no rules
Oh, love
Sweetheart
You're so cruel

She wears my love like a see-through dress
Her lips say one thing
Her movements something else
Oh love
Like a screaming flower
Love
Dying every hour
Love

You don't know if it's fear or desire
Danger the drug that takes you higher
Head in heaven, fingers in the mire

Her heart is racing, you can't keep up
The night is bleeding like a cut
Between the horses of love and lust
We are trampled
Underfoot

Oh, love
You say in love there are no rules
Oh, love
Sweetheart
You're so cruel

Oh, love
To stay with you I'd be a fool
Oh
Sweetheart
You're so cruel
