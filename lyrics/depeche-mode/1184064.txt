Sympathy
Is not a virtue that you recognize
I look into your unforgiving eyes
And see my shame


It's clear to me
That after all the things that weve been through
We've done so much there's nothing left to do
And were both to blame

But as we turn to go our separate ways
I can't help but remember the years
When the world was in our hands
And we had no time for tears

But as we turn to lead our separate lives
My soul aches for what we've become
But the world it doesn't care
When we finish what we've done

Memories
Of a place that we both used to know
A place the two of us could always go
And be as one

Now I can see
That we believed emotions never there
We built them up and then we didn't care
Til they were gone

But as we turn to go our separate ways
I cant help but remember the years
When the world was in our hands
And we had no time for tears

But as we turn to lead our separate lives
My soul aches for what we've become
But the world it doesn't care
When we finish what we've done

I'll walk away and start again
A new beginning from the end
And all that I knew before
Will remain in the past

I'll find a brand new dream to live
I'll find the conviction to forgive
But things won't ever be quite the same
Cause you were the last

But as we turn to go our separate ways
I can't help but remember the years
When the world was in our hands
And we had no time for tears

But as we turn to lead our separate lives
My soul aches for what we've become
But the world it doesn't care
When we finish what we've done.
