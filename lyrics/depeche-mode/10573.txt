When the site was found
We laid the foundations down
It didn't take long before
They came back tumbling down
Don't build at night
You need a little light
How else are you going to see
What it is going to be like


So we picked up our tools
And we worked in the morning light
With the last stone placed
Wasn't it a wonderful site
But it fell back down
And scattered all around
Anything passes
When you need glasses

My monument
It fell down
My monument
It fell down

Work all of my days for this kind of praise
It fell down
Work all of my days
It fell down
