Put it on and don't say a word
Put it on, the one that I prefer
Put it on and stand before my eyes
Put it on, please don't question why


Can you believe
Something so simple
Something so trivial
Makes me a happy man
Can't you understand
Say you belive
Just how easy
It is to please me
Because when you learn you'll know what makes the world turn

Put it on, I can feel so much
Put it on, I don't need to touch
Put it on here before my eyes
Put it on because you realise

And you believe
Something so worthless
Serves a purpose
It makes me a happy man
Can't you understand
Say you believe
Just how easy
It is to please me
Because when you learn you'll know what makes the world turn
