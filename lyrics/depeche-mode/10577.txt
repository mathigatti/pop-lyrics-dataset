Oh God, it's raining
But I'm not complaining
It's filling me up
With new life


The stars in the sky
Bring tears to my eyes
They're lighting my way
Tonight

And I haven't felt so alive
In years

Just for a day
On a day like today
I'll get away from
This constant debauchery

The wind in my hair
Makes me so aware
How good it is to live
Tonight

And I haven't felt so alive
In years

The moon
Is shining in the sky
Reminding me
Of so many other nights
But they're not like tonight

Oh God, it's raining
And I'm not containing
My pleasure at being
So wet
Here on my own
All on my own
How good it feels to be alone
Tonight

And I haven't felt so alive
In years

The moon
Is shining in the sky
Reminding me
Of so many other nights
When my eyes have been so red
I've been mistaken for dead
But not tonight
