I see a river
It's oceans that I want
You have to give me everything
Everything's not enough


It's my desire
To give myself to you
Sometimes

Sometimes I try
Sometimes I lie, with you
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I die, it's true
Somewhere I find
Something that's kind

And I've crossed the line again
A line I drew in sand
Still you give me everything
And everything's not enough

I'm ready but not willing
To give myself to you
Sometimes

Sometimes I try
Sometimes I lie, with you
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I die, it's true
Somewhere I find
Something that's kind

Come on over
Lay down beside me
And I'll try
Come on over
Lay down beside me
And I'll try
And I'll try

I want it all
