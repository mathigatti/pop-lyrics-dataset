Taken in by the delicate noise
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice
Wandering around in silent wonder
 
What chance did I have
With the silver moon
Hanging in the sky
Opening old wounds
 
Taking hold of the hem of your dress
Cleanliness only comes in small doses
Bodily whole but my head's in a mess
Fuelling obsession that borders psychosis
 
It's a sad disease
Creeping through my mind
Causing disabilities
Of the strangest kind
 
Getting lost in the folds of your skirt
There's a price that I pay for my mission
A body in heaven and a mind full of dirt
How I suffer the sweetest condition
 
Taken in by the delicate noise
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice
Wandering around in silent wonder
