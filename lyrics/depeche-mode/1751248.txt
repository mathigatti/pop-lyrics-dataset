Take my hand
And walk in the light
Understand, there's a fire to ignite
You know we have a responsibility
It's true we've been chosen
And now we have the possibility
Of melting what's frozen


Walk with me with the rapture inside
Can't you see it's not our place to decide
You know we have to make a case for love
It's more of a duty
It's clear we have a mission from above
A mission of beauty

You know I wouldn't lie to you
What would I achieve by that
It's more than I would try to do
These are the facts

Take your place here
With love in your heart
Just embrace what you've known from the start
We are fulfilling our only destiny
The angels have spoken
And all the gods in the universe agree
The spell can't be broken
