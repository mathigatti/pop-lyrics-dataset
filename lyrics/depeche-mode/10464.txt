Let's take a map of the world
Tear it into pieces
All of the boys and the girls
Will see how easy it is


To put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
I'll have faith, or I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse

All that we need at the start's
Universal revolution (that's all)
And if we trust in our hearts
We'll find the solution's

To put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
I'll have faith, or I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse

Took a plane across the world
Got in a car
And when I reached my destination
I hadn't gone far

Let's take the whole of the world
The mountains and the sand
Let all the boys and the girls
Shape it in their hands

To put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
I'll have faith, or I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse
