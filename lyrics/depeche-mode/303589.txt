I caught you knocking on my celler door
I love you baby can I have some more
Oh, Oh, the damage done


I hit the city and I lost my pen
I watch the needle take another man
Gone, gone,the damage done
Oh, Oh, Oh

I sing this song because I love the man
I know some of you don't undertand
Miller, to keep from running out
I seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie is like the setting sun
