Got your mother in a whirl
Got your mother in a whirl 'cause
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey, babe, your hairs alright
Hey, babe, lets go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing, and we look divine
You love bands when they play it hard
You want more, and you want it first
Put you down, say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on


Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo

(1st verse) (chorus)

-

Don't ya?
Ow
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo

Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
I love you so much!


You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got transmission and a live wire
Got your cue lines and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dues
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
To what you wanna know
Calamitys child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
Can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress

And your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
How could they know? Ha
Ha-ha
