I'm not going down on my knees begging you to adore me
Can't you see it's misery and torture for me
When I misunderstood try as hard as you can
I've tried as hard as I could
To make you see how important it is for me


Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

Understand me
Understand me
Understand me
Understand me

Some people have to be permanently together
Lovers devoted to each other forever
Now I've got things to do and I've said before
That I know you have too when I'm not there
In spirit I'll be there

Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

Understand me
Understand me
Understand me
Understand me

Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these
