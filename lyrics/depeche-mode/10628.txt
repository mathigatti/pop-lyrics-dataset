There's more besides
Joyrides
The little house in the countryside
Understand
Learn to demand
Compromise
And sometimes lie


Get the balance right
Get the balance right

Be responsible
Respectable
Stable but gullible
Concerned and caring
Help the helpless
But always remain
Ultimately selfish

When you think you've got a hold of it all
You haven't got a hold at all
When you reach the top
Get ready to drop
Prepare yourself for the fall
You're gonna fall
It's almost predictable

Almost

Don't turn this way
Don't turn that way
Straight down the middle until next Thursday
First to the left
Then back to the right
Twist and turn 'til you've got it right
