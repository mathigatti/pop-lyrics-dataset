Death´s Door

Well I´m knocking on death´s door
Will I take my rest
Among the blessed
Mother are you waiting
Father are you pacing
I´m coming home


I´m knocking on death´s door
Will I take my rest
In my Sunday best
Mother are you anxious
Father are you gracious
I´m coming home

I´ve been away too long
For so long you´ve been strong
I´ve been away too long
I know that it was wrong
But I´m coming home

Well I´m knocking on death´s door
Will I take my rest
Have I passed the test
Mother are you praying
Father I am saying
I´m coming home
