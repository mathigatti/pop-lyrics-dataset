It's one of those conversations
We've, we've had them before
The ones that leave you empty
And wanting for more


Your eyes they tell me something
That I understand
Your eyes they hold the truth
And the truth is
You're miles away
You're miles away
You're miles away

Excuse me for my hesitation I've,
I've met you before
Your face seems so familiar
And longing for more

Your eyes they tell me something
That I understand
Your eyes they hold the truth
And the truth is
You're miles away
You're miles away
You're miles away

With all your superstitions
And empty lines
I could be just like you
Withdrawn but alive

Life, it has its limitations
We all have our needs
Love could be the only answer
It lies underneath

Your eyes they tell me something
That I understand
Your eyes they hold the truth
And the truth is
You're miles away
You're miles away
You're miles away

You're miles away
