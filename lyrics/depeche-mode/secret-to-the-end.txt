Oh when I look at you
I'm probably the same way too
I got a feeling that it's coming soon
Could this be the end?


When I look around this room
There must be something I can do
Can I convince you that it isn't true?
We've come to the end

Oh did I disappoint you?
I wanted to believe it's true
Oh the book of love was not enough
To see us through
The problem
Should've been you (Should've been you)
Should've been you (Could've been you)
Should've been you (Would've been you)
(Should've been you, should've been you)
If it hadn't been me
(Would've been you, could've been you)
Should've been you (Should've been you)
Should've been you (Would've been you)
(Should've been you)
If it hadn't been me

It seems so obvious to you
You're feeling what I'm feeling too
The final chapter in the contract expires soon
We've come to the end

Thank God I'm not the same as you
You always know exactly what to do
It's who I am, it's not for you
We've come to the end

Did I disappoint you?
I wanted to believe it's true
Oh the book of love was not enough
To see us through
The problem
Should've been you (Should've been you)
Should've been you (Could've been you)
Should've been you (Would've been you)
(Should've been you, could've been you)
If it hadn't been me
(Would've been you, could've been you)
Should've been you (Should've been you)
Should've been you (Would've been you)
(Should've been you)
If it hadn't been me

(Could've been you, could've been you)
(Should've been you, should've been you)
Should've been you (could've been you)
Should've been you
If it hadn't been me
(Could've been you, could've been you, should've been you)
If it hadn't been me
(Could've been you, could've been you, should've been you)
If it hadn't been me
(Would've been you, could've been you)
(Could've been you, should've been you)
If it hadn't been me
(Could've been you, could've been you, should've been you)
If it hadn't been me
