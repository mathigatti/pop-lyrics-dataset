Poor little one
I will protect you
And surround you with my love
As well as any man can
As well as any man could


I will be there for you, always
And when the black cloud rises
And the radiation pours
I will look you in the eye
And kiss you
And give you all my love
As well as any man can
As well as any man could

You are my eternal, eternal love
