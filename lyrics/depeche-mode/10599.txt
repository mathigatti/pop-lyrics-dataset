I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
But they know me better than that
They know me better than that
They know my weaknessess
I never tried to hide them
They know my weaknessess
I never denied them


I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
How can a view become so twisted
How can a view become so twisted
They know my weaknessess
I never tried to hide them
They know my weaknessess
You tried them

I get so carried away
You brought me down to earth
I thought we got something precious
Now I know what it´s worth

I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
I´ve never felt so disappointed
Never felt so disappointed
They know my weaknessess
I never tried to hide them
They know my weaknessess
Thought that you liked them

They know me better than that
