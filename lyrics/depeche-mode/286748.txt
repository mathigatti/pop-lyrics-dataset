Oh you sad one
Playing the Angel
Isn't so easy where you're from


Oh you wild one
Devil's companion
You won't stay satisfied for long

I don't want you to change
Anything you do

I don't want you to be
Something else for me

Oh you dark one
Eternal outsider
Caught in the spider's web you've spun

Oh you blind one
Gentle and kind one
Seeing the world as a loaded gun

I don't want you to change
Anything you do

I don't want you to be
Someone else for me

Stay as you are
The Darkest Star

Shining for me
Majestically
