I know it's hard to reach you
I know it's hard to breathe
I know it's hard to be you sometimes
I can't imagine what that means


This must be someone else's story
I can't follow what you've planned
How could this be about me
I might suppose to understand

Like a ship on the ocean
Hanging out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you
Lost like me

You're still looking for redemption
Still can't find a trace
If there is nothing after
There'll be the saving grace

I'm giving you control now
I need some kind of sign
Can't take away the sorrow now
I gave you all that's mine

Like a ship on the ocean
Hanging out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you

Like a ship on the ocean
Handed out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you

Lost like me
