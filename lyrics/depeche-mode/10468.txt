She remembered all the shadows and the doubts
The same film


Vivid pictures like a wall that's standing empty
And the night so still

Such a small affair, a relapse
Someone closing like the nightclub door

Here again and when you speak I watch you move away
And seem so sure

She is hoping to forget
And the moment almost slips away

When the colours move apart
And I wonder if you want to stay

And I need to change you
Like the words I'm reading
Don't you understand

This the warning and the message
I remember as you touch my hand
