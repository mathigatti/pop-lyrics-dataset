There's a lynching in the square
You will have to join us
Everyone's going to be there
We're setting up the truss
Once there were solutions
Now we have no excuses
It got lost in confusion
So we're preparing the nooses


And oh, we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?

Blame misinformation, misguided leaders
Apathetic hesitation, uneducated readers
For whatever reasons we now find ourselves in this
We are all charged with treason
And there's no one left to hear

And oh, we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?

We're the judge and the jury
The hangman, the convict
It's too late for fury
Our indictment was hand-picked
So step out to the gallows
And accept your sentence
For being so shallow
You must pay a penance

And oh, we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?

And oh, we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?
