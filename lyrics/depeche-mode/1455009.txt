We are here, we can love
We share something
I'm sure that you'll mean
The world to me


Your name was the one that was always chosen
Your words and the kindness that set me free
Shame as a hole that has kept us frozen
You open my eyes to a world, i could believe

And words can leave you broken inside
You'll have to decide
I'm hanging onto my pride

We are here, we can love
We share something
I'm sure that you'll mean
The world to me
When you get
What you need
It's no way of knowing
What you have is another hole to feed

The games that we played they've left us hoping
The gift that we have, the life that we breathe

This world could leave you broken inside
We've nowhere to hide
I'm hanging onto my pride

We are here, we've been chosen
We've been blessed
With the place we need to find and then open

We are here, we can love
We share something
I'm sure that you'll mean
The world to me

When you get
What you need
It's no way of knowing
What you have is another hole to feed
