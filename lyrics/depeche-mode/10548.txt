There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart
You know how easy it is
To tear it apart!
If I lend it to you, will you keep it safe?
If I lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly?
There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart


There's a sun shining in the sky
But that's not the reason why
I'm feeling warm inside
The answer isn't classified:
It's my heart

From the moment I started
I tried to be good-hearted
Yes, I tried my best
And more or less
I spoke from my heart

There's a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned

There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart
You know how easy it is
To tear it apart
If I lend it to you, will you keep it safe?
If I lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly?
There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart

Hearts can never be owned;
Hearts only come on loan
If I want it back, I will take it back
I'll take my heart
But I will try my best
And more or less
I will speak from my heart
Yes, I will speak from my heart
Speak from my heart

There's a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned
There's a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned

There's a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned
There's a lot be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned

There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart
You know how easy it is
To tear it apart!
If I lend it to you, will you keep it safe?
If I lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly?
There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart
You know how easy it is
To tear it apart!
If I lend it to you, will you keep it safe?
If I lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly
There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart
