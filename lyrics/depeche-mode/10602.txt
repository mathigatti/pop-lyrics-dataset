Sitting target
Sitting waiting
Anticipating
Nothing
Nothing


Life
Is full of surprises
It advertises
Nothing
Nothing

What am I trying to do
What am I trying to say
I'm not trying to tell you anything
You didn't know
When you woke up today

Sitting target
Sitting waiting
God is saying
Nothing
Nothing

Always
Knows the prospects
Learnt to expect
Nothing
Nothing

What am I trying to do
What am I trying to say
I'm not trying to tell you anything
You didn't know
When you woke up today

Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Nothing oh no, nothing oh no [repeat fadeout]
