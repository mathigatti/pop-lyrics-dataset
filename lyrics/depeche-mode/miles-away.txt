It's one of those conversations
We've we've had to devour


The ones that leave you empty
And wanting for more

You're eyes they tell me something
That I understand
You're eyes they hold the truth
And the truth is

You're miles away
You're miles away
You're miles away

Excuse me for my hesitation
Of I met you before
Your face seems so familiar
And belonging for more

You're eyes they tell me something
That I understand

You're eyes they hold the truth
And a truth is

You're miles away
You're miles away
You're miles away

With all your superstitions
And empty lines
I could be just like you
With drum but alive

Life we have with it's limitation
We all have our needs
Love to be the only answer
To lies and their trees

You're eyes they tell me something
That I understand
You're eyes they hold the truth
And a truth is

You're miles away
You're miles away
