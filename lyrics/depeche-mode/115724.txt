Lots of surprises in store
This isn't a party
It's a whole lot more


We've had enough of this blind man's bluff
You've kept us in the dark for long enough

This is more than a party
More than a party
More than a party

Keep telling us we're to have fun
Then take all the ice cream so we've got none

The failed magician waves his wand
And in an instant the laughter's gone

Loads of surprises in store
This isn't a party
It's a whole lot more
