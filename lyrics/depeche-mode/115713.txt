Boys say go!
Boys say go!
Boys say go!
Boys say go!


You don't understand
This is a demand
And I think that I have to show you
Try to look inside
Take me for a ride
In the day and the night
Get to know you

Boys meet boys get together
Boys meet boys live forever
Don't say no
Boys say go

I can run away
If you never stay
And the rain and the pain and the sorrow
I'm not very sure
When you close the door
If the end is the same as tomorrow

Boys!
Boys!
Boys say go!
