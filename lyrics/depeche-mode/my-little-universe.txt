My little universe is expanding
Slowly
Those who know me
Say I'm growing every day


Beautiful emptiness surrounds me
I take small steps
I'm making progress in a nonspecific way

Here I am king
I decide everything
I let no-one in
No-one
No-one
No-one

Limited consciousness preserves me
It protects me
And just connects enough to keep the walls at bay

My little universe is expanding
Slowly
Those who know me
Say I'm growing every day

Here I am king
I decide everything
I let no-one in
No-one
No-one
No-one
