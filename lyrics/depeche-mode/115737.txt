Plans made in the nursery
Can change the course of history
Remember that


Mommy's annoyed, says go and play
Don't show your face
Stay away all day
Shouldn't have done that

A small boy and his infantry
Marching around so naturally
Shouldn't have done that

Grows up and goes to school
Such a nice boy
Obeys all the rules
Mommy's proud of that

Leaves school to follow his ambition
Knows what he wants
To be a politician
Shouldn't have done that!
