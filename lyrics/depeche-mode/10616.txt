I will have faith in man
That is hard to understand
Show some humility
You have the ability
Get right with me


Friends, if you've lost your way
You will find it again some day
Come down from your pedestals
And open your mouths that's all
Get right with me

Life is such a short thing
That I cannot comprehend
But if this life were a bought thing
There are ways I know we'd mend

People, take my advice
Already told you once, once or twice
Don't waste your energy
Making apologies
Get right with me
