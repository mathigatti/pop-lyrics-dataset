We had something, that was yesterday
Temptation's knocking at my door
You talk to me about the life we could've had
Oh, we don't have that life no more


But I like the way you move
Yeah, I like the way you move for me tonight
I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
Alright now

If you give me something you and I can play
Let me be your man
I don't need you, I don't need your ball and chain
There's no water in that well

But I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
Alright yeah

All night
Alright now
All night

Imagination is all it takes
You came knocking at my door
You talk to me about the life we should've had
You know you could've given more

But I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
Alright now

All night
