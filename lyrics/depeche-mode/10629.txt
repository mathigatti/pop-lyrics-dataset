Here speaks the voice of reason
It's talking to me
Loud and clearly
And obviously
It's something to say


Here comes another sentence
It is relentless
It tries my patience
But nevertheless
It's for our concern

We can't see the benefits
So we'll ignore it
Or disobey it
And then we'll say that
This is fun

This is real fun
This is fun
