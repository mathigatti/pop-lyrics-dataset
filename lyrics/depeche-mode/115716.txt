Charms in limited supply
And refusing to stretch
That indefinable nothing
Somehow keeps pushing you
Finding the right words
Can be a problem
How many times must it be said
There's no plan
It had to happen
 
Got to move on sometime
And it's about time
By putting one foot in front on another
And repeating the process
Cross over the street
You're free to change your mind
Strength through diversity
Couldn't have put it more plainly
Got to move on sometime
Got to move on sometime
Got to move on sometime
Got to move on sometime
 
Charms in limited supply
Under threat of extinction
That indefinable nothing
Somehow motivates you
Finding the right words
Can be a problem
How many times must it be said
There's no plan
It had to happen
 
Got to move on sometime
And it's about time
By putting one foot in front on another
And repeating the process
Cross over the street
You're free to change your mind
Strength through diversity
 
Couldn't have put it more plainly
Got to move on sometime
