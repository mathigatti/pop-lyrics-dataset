You enter to the fire 
you know what you have to do 


You've got your perfect face on 
your body is dressed to kill 

Breathe one last breath now 
push out all thats real 

you feel 
you feel I need you 
I need to feel you 

And temptation gets too much 
your excited by the fear 
Hungry for a strangers touch 
true love disappears 
Into a darkened room 

And somewhere there's a warm heart 
to whom which you are bound 

But its hard to feel the warmth here 
that heart is not around 

So the body's an icy tomb 
An Urn to be fulfulled 
With one thrust of sweet passion 
True loves coffin will be sealed 

You feel 
You feel I need you 
I need to feel you 

And temptation gets to much 
Your excited by the fear 
Hungry for a strangers touch 
True love disappears 
Into a darkened room 

And temptation gets to much 
Your excited by the fear 
Hungry for a strangers touch 
True love disappears
