Don't know' present time 
Children of the other crime 
All my dreams are wasting now 
No more reason' see the cloud 
As I watch you from the road 
Find it open' Reason Man 
Find it open' Reason Man 


Moving in there's nothing to see 
One look and you'll always regret 
Thinking someone ought to hear 
If you listen and only fear 
Things were edging to the right 
See him laughing' Reason Man 
See him laughing' Reason Man 

Ever infected all the time 
Only boredom crime 
Blessed with the feeling we will break 


Now infecting Reason Man 
Now infecting Reason Man
