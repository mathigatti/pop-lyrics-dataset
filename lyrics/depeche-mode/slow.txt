Slow, slow
Slow as you can go
So I can feel all I want to know
Slow, slow
I'll go with your flow


Let the world keep its carnival pace
I prefer to look into your beautiful face
What a waste
Let the stars continue to fly by
I don't have one desire to understand why
I don't try

Slow, slow
As slow as you can go
I want my senses to overflow
Slow, slow
And doesn't it show

I don't need a race in my bed
When speed's in my heart
And speed's in my head instead
It's tempting for fools to rush in
When something's so good
Why should we rush a thing
It's a sin

Slow, slow
Slow as you can go
That's how I like it
I like it

I don't need a race in my bed
When speed's in my heart
And speed's in my head instead

Slow, slow
Slow as you can go
That's how I like it
I like it
That's how I like it
That's how I like it
