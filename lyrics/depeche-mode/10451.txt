The handshake seals the contract
From the contract there´s no turning back
The turning point of a career
In korea being insincere
The holiday was fun-packed
The contract, still intact


The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves after all
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves after all
It´s a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts

The graph on the wall
Tells the story of it all
Picture it now
See just how
The lies and deceit gained a little more power
Confidence taken in
By a suntan and a grin

The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves after all
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves after all
It´s a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts
Everything counts in large amounts


The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts.

The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts.

Everything, Everything, Everything, Everything

The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts.

The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts.

The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts.
