From this cloud where I hang, dangled in the blue
I spy you all tiny creatures on the ground below
For my being reckless got me strung up in the sky


Love is flawed now, see the lawless cry
Cut my cord now, better then, better off to die
Here am I, your falling angel, dangled in the blue
I'm your angel, and I wish that I could be like you


It's my time, all I have for my crime is such
Knowing that the thing I love is that which I can't touch
So I watch your fragile beauty changing in the sun

Love is flawed now, see the lawless cry
Cut my cord now, better then, better off to die
But here am I, your falling angel, dangled in the blue
I'm your angel, how I wish that I could be with

Falling angel, dangled in the blue
I'm your angel, and I wish that I could be like you

I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you
