Get out the crane
Construction time again
What is it this time
We're laying a pipeline


Let the beads of sweat flow
Until the ends have met through
Could take a long time
Working on the pipeline

Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy

On this golden day
Work's been sent our way
That could last a lifetime
Working on the pipeline

From the heart of our land
To the mouth of the man
Must reach him sometime
We're laying a pipeline

Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy
