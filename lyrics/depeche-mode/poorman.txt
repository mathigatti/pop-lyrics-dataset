Hey, hey, hey, hey

Hey, there's no news
Poor man's still got the blues
He's walking around in worn out shoes
With nothing to lose


Hey, he's on the road
Pushing along his heavy load
Heading for no fixed abode
Shuffling slow

Hey

Corporations get the breaks
Keeping almost everything they make
And tell us just how long it's going to take
For it to trickle down
When will it trickle down?

Hey, he's on the street
Laying in the snow and sleet
Begging for something to eat
Looking beat

Hey, passers by
They don't dare to catch his eye
Couldn't even tell you why
Or what's happenin' inside

Corporations get the breaks
Keeping almost everything they make
Tell us just how long it's going to take
For it to trickle down
When will it trickle down?
