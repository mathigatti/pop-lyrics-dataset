Take a look at unselected cases
You'll find love has been wrecked
By both sides compromising
Amounting to a disastrous effect


You hear stories of old
Of princes bold
With riches untold
Happy souls
Casting it all aside
To take some bride
To have the girl of their dreams
At their side
But not me
I couldn't do that
Not me
I'm not like that

I couldn't sacrifice
Anything at all
To love

I really like you
I'm attracted to you
The way you move
The things you do
I'll probably burn in hell
For saying this
But I'm really in heaven
Whenever we kiss
But oh no!
You won't change me
You can try
For an eternity

I wouldn't sacrifice
Anything at all
To love

Take a look at unselected cases
You'll find love has been wrecked
By both sides compromising
Amounting to a disastrous effect

Now I've got things to do
You have too
And I've got to be me
You've got to be you
So take my hand
And feel these lips
And let's savor a kiss
Like we'd savor a sip
Of vintage wine
One more time
Let's surrender
To this love divine

But we won't sacrifice
Anything at all
To love
