I dream of a day when I dare to believe you're the answer
When the shame and the guilt are removed and the truth appears
With the touch of your hand, I lose who I am if I want to
I tried to resist but succumb to the bliss of your kiss


You should be higher
I'll take you higher
Don't be afraid
You'll just have to pray

Your lies are more attractive than the truth
Love is all I want
Your lies are written down in your book
Love is all I want

Your arms are infected
They'lre holding the truth
Oh stop all your crying
This one you'll lose

You should be higher
I'll take you higher
Don't be afraid
You'll just have to pray

Your lies are more attractive than the truth
Love is all I want
Your lies are written down in your book
Love is all I want

You should be higher
You should be higher
