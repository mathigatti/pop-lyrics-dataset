Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently


I've been walking a thin white line
Between love and hate
I could use a little company
A little kindness could go a long way

Weeks turned into months
Months turned into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up fear

Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently

I've been walking a thin white line
Between love and hate
I could use a little company
A little kindness could go a long way

Weeks turned into months
Months turned into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up fear
Living the same delusion
Gathering up fear
