You have poison in you heart
And I'm sure of it
I knew right from the start
From the moment we met
You know we have to break up
You'll always be alone


You know you've never ever been a friend
Now we're closer to the edge

There's poison in your mind
Yeah, I'm sure of it
You've never be that kind
With all due respect
You know it's time to break up
You'll always be alone

You know you've never ever been a friend
Now we're closer to the edge

We've been walking far too long that I see road
My broken heart is colder than a stone
I know you've never ever be my friend
Now you push me to the edge
