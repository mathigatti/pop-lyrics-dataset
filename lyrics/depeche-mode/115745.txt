Sometimes watch you walk the street at midnight
Sometimes I can feel you in the air
Looking good
Knew you would
All the time I understood
 
Hey, you're such a pretty boy,
Hey, you're such a pretty boy,
Hey, you're such a pretty boy,
You're so pretty
 
Everybody seems to look your way now
(Everybody seems to look your way)
Everybody wants to know your name
(Hey, hey, what's your name)
Feeling right
Just tonight
Hear them say you're out of sight
 
All the boys we got to get together
All the boys together we can stand
We can go
Never know
All the things we need to show
 
Hey you're such a pretty boy (you're so pretty)
Hey you're such a pretty boy (you're so pretty)
Hey you're such a pretty boy
You're so pretty (p-r-e, double-t-y)
