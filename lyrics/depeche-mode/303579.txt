Oohh, Do-do do-do-do
Da da da da da


Things that you used to say now take on different meanings you
realise
Can't be to careful about the lines.
Come on you know you're not so young you cannot hide behind
disguise
Listen to your own desire.

Eyes like an angel - so wise, don't lie
You never felt like this before.
Fly like an angel - so high this time,
You send your senses streaming free.

-

Places you used to go when you were young look different in the
dark,
Don't you worry it's O.K.
And maybe I can help you find your way tonight I think you will
agree
Summer reason's run away.

Eyes like an angel - so wise, don't lie
You never felt like this before
Fly like an angel - so high this time
You've got your senses streaming free

-

Oh I hear your heart beating even faster now than mine
Now you know just what I mean.
So take your place among those twilight gleaming rivers that you
read
Give me reasons to believe

Eyes like an angel - so wise don't lie
You never feel like this again
Fly like an angel - so high this time
You send my senses streaming free


Like an angel... da da da-da
Like an angel... da da daa
