Can I have your autograph?
he said to the fat blond actress
You know, I've seen every movie you've been in
from "Pass of Pain" to "Duels of Glory"
And when you kissed Robert Mitchum
Gee, but I thought you'd never catch him
You're over the hill right now, and you're looking for love
You're over the hill right now, and you're looking for love
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me
Can I have your autograph?
he said to the fat blond actress
You know, I know everything you've done
Anyway, I hate divorces
To the left is a marble shower
It was fun even for an hour, but
You're over the hill right now, and you're looking for love
You're over the hill right now, and you're looking for love
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me
Something's got a hold on me and I don't know what
Something's got a hold on me and I don't know what
It's the beginning of a new age...
