Would you like to go on the Coney Island Steeple
Go and have a good time
We'll take the subway right down to King's Highway
Gonna have a good time
If it's all right it would be so nice
If you come and go with me
The roller-coaster you and me
Just try
Would you like to go on the Coney Island Steeple
Go and have a good time
Like a sister and brother we'll cling to each other
When they find out their parents aren't there
Oh it'd be so nice
Like choco with ice
Oh if you come and go with me
How nice it would be
Don't be so shy
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Maybe not Friday
Saturday, Sunday
Coney Island, Coney Island, Coney Island ...
