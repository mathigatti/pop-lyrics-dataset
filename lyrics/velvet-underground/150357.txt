In this world as we know it
sorrows come and go
Now we see the human race
has put its footprints on the moon's face


Satellite's gone up to the sky
But it's not as nice as looking in your eyes

Woh, take it for a little while
no, I could watch it on TV, yeah

Satellite of love, oh, satellite of love
Satellite of love, satellite of

Satellite's gone up to the sky
And it's going to drive me out of my mind

Woh, take it for a little while
no, I can watch it on TV, yeah

Satellite of love, satellite of love
Satellite of love, satellite of

I've been told, baby, you've been bold
to winkin', blinkin' and nod
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
to winkin', blinkin' and nod

Satellite of love, satellite of love
Satellite of love, satellite of

Satellite of love
Satellite of love, it's just a little bit of
A satellite of love
