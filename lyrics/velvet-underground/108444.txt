Coyote goes to the top of the hill
doin' the things that coyote's will
Staring at the sky, at the moon
you know he starts to howl


Coyote goes to the mountain top
looks over down at the river, says "What a drop"
No tame dog is gonna take my bone

Coyote at the top of the hill
doin' the things coyote's will
You gotta cast the first stone
cast the first stone

Jackal goes to the top of the hill
doin' the things that jackal's will
Staring at the moon
you know he starts to howl

Wild dog up on the mountain top
blood in his jaws, the bone, he drops
No tame dog is ever
ever gonna take my bone

Jackal up on the top of the hill
doin' the things that jackal's will
Cast the first stone
cast the first stone

Coyote on top of the hill
ooohhh, doin' the things that coyote's will
Staring at the sky, looks at the moon
he starts to howl

Coyote up on the mountain top
blood in his jaws, the bone, he drops
Says no tame dog is ever
ever gonna take this bone

Coyote up on the mountain top
says "What a drop"
You gotta cast the first stone
cast the first stone
Cast the first stone
you gotta cast the first stone
