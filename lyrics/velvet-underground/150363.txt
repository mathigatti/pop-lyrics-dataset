We're the Velvet Underground and we have come to play
it's been 28 years since we've been here to the day


There's Maureen, she's on the drums, she's havin' lot of fun
let's hear it for Moe Tucker, beat those skins for everyone

There is Sterling Morrison, he's playing the guitar
he's a guitar hero, kicks their asses really far

Now you got here John and me

Now you got here John and me, we want no part of this
that's because we think it is real pretentious shit
