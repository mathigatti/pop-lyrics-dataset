There is no reason
        to treat me this way
        Take all my love
        and just throw it way
        All of my hopes and dream
        you took away everything and -


        There is no reason
        there is no reason
        Treat me this way

        (You gonna keep this going)

        There is no reason
        to cause me such pain
        Turn out the sunlight
        turn on my rain
        All of my hopes and dream
        you took away everything and -

        There is no reason
        there is no reason
        To treat me this way

        All of my hopes and dream
        you took away everything

        There is no reason
        there is no reason
        To treat me this way

        Oh, baby, this way
        oh, you treat me this way
        Oh, baby, this way
