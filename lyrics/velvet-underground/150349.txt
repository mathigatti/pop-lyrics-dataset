Oh, there's one thing, baby
I just don't understand
Two old women fighting for
another man
You know it's just too much
ooohhh, you know it's just too much
Oh, it's too much, baby
and I just don't understand


Oh, here comes Mary
coming over the hill
They say she won't
but her sister will
You know it's just too much
ooohhh, you know it's just too much
You know it's too much, baby
and I just don't understand
oh, rock on

Oh, here comes my, na, na, na
with a buckle of gold
Everybody says, hey
rock your soul
You know it's just too much
ooohhh, just too much
You know it's too much, baby
and I just don't understand

Hey take me back now
baby, where I belong
Everything, you know
I'm doing wrong
You know it's just too much
ooohhh, just too much
Oh, you know it's too much, baby
and I just don't understand
oh, just

Everytime I'm going out
for my thrill
Here comes Mary
and I get no fill
You know it's just too much
oh, know it's, know it's just too much
Oh, you know it's too much, baby
and I just don't understand

You know it's too, too, too much
you know it's too, too, too much
You know it's too, too, too much
you know it's too, too, too much
You know it's too much, baby
and I just don't understand
