one, two, three...
If you close the door
the night could last for ever
leave the sunshine out and say 'hello' to never
all the peolple are dancing and they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me
but if you close the door
I'll never have to see the day again
if you close the door
the night could last for ever
leave the wineglass out
and drink a toast to never
Oh! someday I know someone will look into my eyes 
and say 'hello' 
you are my very special one
but if you close the door
I'll never have to see the day again
Dark cloudy bars  
Shiny Cadillac cars 
and the people are in subways and trains
looking grey under rain as they stand disarrayed
all the people look over in the dark
and if you close the door
the night could last for ever
leave the sunshine out and say 'hello' to never
all the peolple are dancing and they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me
'cause if you close the door
I'll never have to see the day again
I'll never have to see the day again
once more
I'll never have to see the day again
