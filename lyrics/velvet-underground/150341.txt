I got fever in my pocket
You know I gotta move
Hey babe, I guess I'm falling in love


I got fever in my pocket
Down to my shoes
Oh babe, I guess I'm falling in love

I got in my pocket, hey babe
Everything that I can have
I've got thing in my loveline?
It's gonna work out fine
It's gonna be allright

I gotta move
You got yours on your side
Hey now babe, I guess I'm falling in love

I got fever in my pocket
Down to my shoes
Oh babe, I guess I'm falling in love

You'd better move it on sweet babe
Hey on down to your shoes
Things they're right, mama
You know it'll work out fine
Hey you gotta lose

Got hand in my pocket
You know it work also?
Oh babe, I guess I'm falling in love
I've got ankles in my breasts
I find it's hard to lose
Oh babe, guess I'm falling in love
Oh babe, guess I'm falling in love
Oh babe, guess I'm falling in love
