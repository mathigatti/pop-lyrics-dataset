Somebody shut the door
I know where temptation lies
Inside of you heart
You can talk during this
I know where the evil lies
Inside of your heart


Well get out of here
If you're gonna try to make it right
You're surely gonna end up wrong
Wrong wrong wrong wrong
Oh shut the door
That's the only chord I know

I know where the mirror's edge
Is inside of your heart
I know where the razors edge
Is inside of your heart, motown
It's no even within five feet

Well if you're gonna make it right
You're surely gonna end up wrong
You don't look like Martha and the Vandellas
I'm just gonna start it all over again
Somebody get her out of here

Electricity comes from other planets
It's not that a bad solo. Four times is pretty together
You can't stay here. Yes I can.
I can talk to myself as well
I'll lock the door this time

I know where temptation lies
Inside of your heart. Yes he's ready
I know where the evil lies
Inside of your heart. Is he ready?
Well if you're gonna make it right
You're surely gonna end up wrong

Oh the hole mess start again
Well New York buildings are very hight
And not all offensive. Lock the door
Gonna carry on at infinite leght, my dear
The Pope in the silver castle
Was that awful
Hey, that's fine. That's it
