I dont care about your ways
Of love and life and walkin
I dont care about your days
Of carin and not talkin


But its your right
The way that you live
Its all right
The way that you live

You wont call
It doesnt matter if your sun shines in the evening
Dont wait
The moon will wait to come out in the night and talkin

I dont care about your present pay
And your night life you keep burning
I dont care about what your old man says
All the ways you have of learnin

But its your right
The way that you live
Its all right
The way that you live

You dont write
It doesnt matter what they all say, gonna mess around
Its ok
It doesnt matter if your off or fine gonna learn

I dont care about your ways
Of love and life and walkin
I dont care about your days
Of carin and not talkin

But its your right
The way that you live
Its all right
The way that you live
Its all right
The way that you live
Its all right
The way that you live
Its all right
The way that you live
Its all right
