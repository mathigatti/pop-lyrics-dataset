Never been to london, never been to France
Never was sorry never learned to dance
Never walked down to 42nd street and Frairs
Never smoked any filtered air


Guess it's true what all the people say
Gonna have to mend my old time ways, yeah
I guess it's true, guess, I've lived a sheltered life

Never walked about on the streets at night
Never got into an uptown fight
Never smoked a hookah, never saw a rug
Couldn't even squash a beetle bug

Guess it's true I'm gonna have to change my ways
Guess it's true what all the people say, yeah
I know it's true, guess, I've lived a sheltered life

Never went to parties in a chauffeured car
Never wore a top hat, 'cause I won't get far
Never learned to handle all the things that I've seen
Maybe I'll grow up to be big and mean

Guess it's true what all the people say
Gonna have to change my old fashioned ways, well
I guess it's true, guess, I've lived a sheltered life
