She's over by the corner
Got her hands by her sides
They hit her harder harder harder
Till they thought she might die


Well I got a foggy notion, do it again
Over by the corner, do it again
I got my calomine lotion baby, do it again
I got a foggy notion, do it again

She made me do something that I never did before
I rushed right down to a flower store
I bought her a boundle a beautiful batch
Dont't you know something, she sent 'em right back

Sally Mae, Sally Mae, Sally Mae, Sally Mae
Sally Mae, Sally Mae, Sally Mae, Sally Mae
