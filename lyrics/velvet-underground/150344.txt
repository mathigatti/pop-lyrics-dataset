Ah, you've got such understanding ways
I believe everything that you say
Smiling faces not forgotten 'cause
I love you


When I think of all the things we've done
and we haven't even yet begun
Smiling faces not forgotten 'cause
I love you

Just for a little while
oh, just to see you smile
Just for a little while

You've got such understanding ways
oh, I believe, I believe every word that you say
Smiling faces not fogotten 'cause
I love you
