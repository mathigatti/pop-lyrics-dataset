Could you just be here again
To know what there was to see
When all the Sunday people
Where so quiet in the dark

Keep it secret
For to hide somewhere at last
As long as we could see
The sky confessed this crime
Of futile tasting hate romance
Above our shattered minds
It was a pleasure, It was a pleasure
