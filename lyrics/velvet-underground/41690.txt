Looking for another place
Somewhere else to be
Looking for another chance
To ride into the sun
Ride into the sun(4x)
Where everything seems so pretty
When you're lonely and tired of the city
Remember its a flower made out of clay
To the city where everything seems so ugly
When you're sitting at home in self-pity
Remember you're just one more person who is living there


Is hard to live in the city(6x)
