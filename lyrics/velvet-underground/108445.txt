Before being a man
Livin' in a garbage pail
My landlady call me up
She tried to hit me with a mop


I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
But if Shelly she would just come back
It'll be allright
But if Shelly she would just come back
It'll be allright

I live with thirteen dead cats
A purple who hear spats
They're all livin in a hall
And I can't stand it anymore

I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
But if Shelly she would just come back
It'll be allright
But if Shelly she would just come back
It'll be allright

Before being a man
Livin' in a garbage pail
My landlady call me up
She tried to hit me with a mop

I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
But if Shelly she would just come back
It'll be allright
But if Shelly she would just come back
It'll be allright
Be allright, be allright....
