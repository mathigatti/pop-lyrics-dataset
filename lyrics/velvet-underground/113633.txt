Some kinds of love
Marguerita told Tom
Between thought and expression lies a lifetime
Situations arise because of the weather
And no kinds of love
Are better than others
Some kinds of love
Margueirta told Tom
Like a dirty French novel
The absured courts the vulgar
And some kinds of love
The possibilites are endless
And for me to miss one
Would seem to be groundless
I head what you said
Margueritat told Tom
And of course you're a bore
But at that you're not charmless
For a bore is a straight line
That finds a wealth in division
And some kinds of love
Are mistaken for vision
Put jelly on your shoulder
Let us do what you fear most
That from which you recoil
But which still makes your eyes moist
Put jelly on your shoulder
Lie down upon the carpet
Between thought and expression
Let us now kiss the culprit
I don't know just what it's all about
Put on your red pajamas and find out.
