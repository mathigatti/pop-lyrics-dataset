She's my best friend, certainly not the average girl
She's my best friend, understands me when I'm falling down
Oh, it hurts to be that way
Oh, it hurts to know that you're that kinda fellow
Here's to Newspaper Joe, dropped his teeth on the floor
Caught his hand in the door
Guess that's the way the news goes


If you want to see me
Sorry, but I'm not around
If you want to feel me
Turn around, I'm by the window where the light is

She' my best friend, better than a dog or cat
She's my best friend, understands me when I'm falling down
Oh, it hurts to be that way
Oh, it hurts to know that you're that kinda fellow
Here's to Mullberry Jane, She made jam when she came
Somebody cut off her feet, now jelly rolls in the street
If you want to see me
Sorry, but I 'm not around
If you want to feel me
Turn around, I'm by the window where the light is

She's my best friend, certainly not the average girl
She's my best friend, understands me when I'm falling

Falling down, falling down
