Here I go again
just gonna play it like a fool again
Here I go again
over you
Over you


I'm just like a bell again
you know, I'm starting to ring again
Here I go again
over you
Over you

Typically, when I had it
treated it like dirt
Now, naturally, when I don't have it
I am chasing less and less rainbows

Here we go again
I guess, I'm like a fool again
Here I go again
over you
Over you
over you
Over you
