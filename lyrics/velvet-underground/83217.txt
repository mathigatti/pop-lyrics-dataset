Ah, now I don't hardly know her 
But I think I could love her 
Crimson and clover 


Ah when she comes walking over 
Now I've been waitin' to show her 
Crimson and clover over and over 

Yeah, my, my such a sweet thing 
I wanna do everything 
What a beautiful feeling 
Crimson and clover over and over 

Crimson and clover over and over 
Crimson and clover over and over 
Crimson and clover over and over 
Crimson and clover over and over
