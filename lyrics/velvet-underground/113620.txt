Lonesome cowboy Bill
Rides the rodeo
Lonesome cowboy Bill
You got to see him yodel "ay-hee-ho!"
Lonesome cowboy Bill
Rides the rodeo
Ever since he was a little lad
Loves the rodeo
Bucking broncs, yeah, sipping wine
You got to see him go
And all the ten-gallon girls
Love to hear him yodel "ay-hee-ho!"
Because
Lonesome cowboy Bill
Rides the rodeo
Lonesome cowboy Bill
You got to see him yodel "ay-hee-ho!"
Oh, lonesome cowboy Bill
You still ride the Rodeo
Up 'round the colorado shore
Down by the Ohio
Sometimes even New Orleans
Down by the Mardi Gras
And all the ten-gallon girls
Love to hear him yodel "ay-hee-ho!"
He's lonesome cowboy bill, he rides the rodeo
Just a lonesome cowboy Bill
You got to see him yodel "ay-hee-ho!"
You got to see him in the rodeo
When he's ridin', goin' too darn fast
You got to hear the people scream and shout
They call him
Lonesome cowboy Bill
He's a
Lonesome cowboy Bill
He goes...
Lonesome cowboy Bill
Rides the rodeo
Lonesome cowboy Bill
You got to see him yodel "ay-hee-ho!"
I said
You got to see him yodel "ay-hee-ho!"
Oh, he's a lonesome cowboy Bill, lonesome cowboy Bill...
