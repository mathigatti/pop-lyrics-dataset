Teenage Mary said to Uncle Dave
 I sold my soul, must be saved
 Gonna take a walk down to Union Square
 You never know who you're gonna find there


 You gotta run, run, run, run, run
 Take a drag or two
 Run, run, run, run, run
 Gypsy Death and you
 Tell you whatcha do

 Marguerita Passion had to get her fix
 She wasn't well, she was getting sick
 Went to sell her soul, she wasn't high
 Didn't know, thinks she could buy it

 And she would run, run, run
Take a drag or two
 Run, run, run, run, run
 Gypsy Death and you
 Tell you whatcha do

 Seasick Sarah had a golden nose
 Hobnail boots wrapped around her toes
 When she turned blue, all the angels screamed
 They didn't know, they couldn't make the scene

 She had to run, run, run, run, run
 Take a drag or two
 Run, run, run, run, run
 Gypsy Death and you
 Tell you whatcha do

 Beardless Harry, what a waste
 Couldn't even get a small-town taste
 Rode the trolleys down to forty-seven
 Figured he was good to get himself to heaven

 'Cause he had to run, run, run, run, run
 Take a drag or two
 Run, run, run, run, run
 Gypsy Death and you
 Tell you whatcha do
