"Perfect Day (Trainspotting)"


Just a perfect day
Drink sangria in the park
And then later when it gets dark we go home


Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
And then later, a movie too and then home

Oh it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spend it with you
Oh such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on

Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's such fun

Just a perfect day
You make me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good

Oh it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spend it with you
Oh such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on

You're going to reap
Just what you sow
You're going to reap
Just what you sow
You're going to reap
Just what you sow
You're going to reap
Just what you sow
