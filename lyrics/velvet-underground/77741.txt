Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why she's given half her life to people she hates now
Stephanie says when answering the phone
What country shall I say is calling from across the world


But she's not afraid to die, the people all call her 'Alaska'
Between worlds so the people ask her 'cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind

Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why it is thought she's the door She can't be the room
Stephanie says but doesn't hang up the phone
What sea shell sea is calling from across the world

But she's not afraid to die, the people all call her 'Alaska'
Between worlds so the people ask her 'cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind

They're asking is it good or bad
It's such an icy feeling, It's so cold in Alaska
It's so cold in Alaska, It's so cold in Alaska
