Train round the bend
Takin me away from my country
I'm sick of the trees
Take me to the city
Train comin' round the bend
Oh train comin' round the bend
Been in the country Oh much too long
Trying to be a farmer
But nothing that I planted never seems to grow
Train comin' round the bend
Train comin' round the bend
Hey I am just a city boy
And really not the country kind
Oh I need the city streets and I need your light
To see bend comin' round the bend
The train comin' round the bend
Allright
Ooh Ohh
Once
She's going twice
She's going to the loop up and down
She's going twice
She's going the train comin round the bend
You know the train comin round the bend
And I'm out of nowhere
Takin' me back where I belong
I've been here once and I don't take it tonight
For the train comin round the bend
The train comin round the bend
