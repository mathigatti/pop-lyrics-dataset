If you think that it's all right
you know what you'll have to do
You're walkin' down 5th Avenue
you're seein' things that aren't true
Without you I ain't gonna be waitin'
you're not a hesitating, here it comes


I'm not too sorry
now that you're gone
I don't think I'll miss you
I found a new one

If you know that it's not right
that I'll see you some other night
But if you want it when you're gone
you'll find yourself another one
So now, ok
worry, it's around, oh, oh

I'm not too sorry
now that you're gone
I don't think I'm sorry
'cause I found a new one
It wouldn't break my heart
it wouldn't make it hard to go around
