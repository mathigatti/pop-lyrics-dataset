Things aren't what they seem
I'm always drifting into dream
It's just a silly scene
everything I do ends up in dream


But it's not what you say and you do
that makes it look hard of what your feelin'
It's just what you say to do
that makes me feel like your head is real and down

Oh, and love makes you feel, oh, ten foot tall
Oh, and love makes you feel ten foot tall

It's not a funny scene
but I'm always drifting, oh, into dreams, ah
It's not a love affair
but I'm just drifting into air

But it's not what you say and you do
oh, that makes it seem like a certain party
It's just all of that you do
that makes me feel that you kidding, way too smart

Oh, and, love makes you feel ten foot tall
Oh, and love makes you feel ten foot tall
like this

'Cause love makes you feel ten foot tall
'Cause love makes you feel ten foot tall
