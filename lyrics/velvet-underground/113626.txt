Well, I'm beginning to see the light.
Well, I'm beginning to see the light.
Some people work very hard,
but still they never get it right.
Well, I'm beginning to see the light.
I wanna tell all you people, now.
Now, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light.
Hey, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light.
Wine in the mornin', and some breakfast at night.
Well, I'm beginning to see the light.
Here we go again, playing the fool again.
Here we go again, acting hard again.
All right!
Well, I'm beginning to see the light!
I wanna tell you, ooh-oh-oh!
Hey, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light!
It comes very softly now.
I wore my teeth in my hands so I could miss the hell of a night.
Hey!  Well, I'm beginning to see the light!
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, baby,
I'm beginning to see the light, now!
It comes softer!
Hey, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light.
I met myself in a dream, and I just want to tell you,
Everything was alright.
Hey, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light.
Here comes two of you.
Which one will you choose?
One is black and one is blue,
Don't know just, what to do.
Alright!
Well, I'm beginning to see the light, oh, now, here she comes!
Hey, yeah, baby, I'm beginning to see the light!
Oh-ahhhh!
Some people work very hard,
But still they never get it right.
Well, I'm begiing to see the light.
Ah, it's getting a little softer, maybe, in there.
Now, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light.
Ah, it's coming around again,
Hey, now, now, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light.
One more time.
There are problems in these times,
But, woo!, none of them are mine!
Oh, baby, I'm beginning to see the light.
Here we go again,
I thought that you were my friend.
Here we go again,
I thought that you were my friend.
