She's got all the right words
Speaks with such finesse
She knows how to paint her face
She knows how to dress
She can turn a maybe into a yes


She'll make you cry
To know why
You were weak instead of shy
She'll make you cry
To know why
You were weak instead of shy
She'll make you cry

She knows all the reasons
Speaks them out with ease
She knows how to instigate you
And how to appease
She can turn a no into a please

She'll make you cry
To know why
You were weak instead of shy
She'll make you cry
To know why
You were weak instead of shy
She'll make you cry

She'll make you cry
To know why
You were weak instead of shy
She'll make you cry
To know why
You were weak instead of shy
She'll make you cry
Make you cry
Make you sigh
