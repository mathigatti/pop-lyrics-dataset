Oh, Gin
how could you treat me this way
Oh, treat me this way


Oh, Gin
how could you treat me this way
Baby, treat me this way

You know you broke my heart
ever since you went away

You gotta feel it and like it
and if you move you gotta drill it and hold it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Gin
how could you treatin' me this way

You know you broke my heart
ever since you went away

Oh, Gin
how could you treat me this way
Hey, you treat me this way

Oh, Gin
how could you treat me this way
How you treat me this way

You know you broke my heart
ever since you went away

You gotta feel it and like it
and if you move it like it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Gin
how could you treat me this way

You know I'm gonna stay alone
'til you're coming back and play

You know I've been so sad
ever since you went away
You know I've been so sad
ever since you went away
