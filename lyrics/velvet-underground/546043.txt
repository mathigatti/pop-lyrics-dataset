Here's room 506
It's enough to make you sick
Brigit's all wrapped up in foil
You wonder if
She can uncoil


Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea girls

Here's room 115
Filled with sm queens
Magic marker row
You wonder just
How high they go

Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea girls

Here's pope dear ondine
Rona's treated him so mean
She wants another scene
She wants to be
A human being

Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea girls

Pepper, she's having fun
She thinks she's some men's son
Her perfect loves don't last
Her future died
In someone's past

Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea girls

Dear Ingrid's found her lick
She's turned another trick
Her treats and times revolve
She's got problems
To be solved

Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea girls

Poor Mary, she's uptight
She can't turn out her light
She rolled Susan in a ball
And now she can't
See her at all

Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea girls

Drop-out, she's in a fix
Amphetamine has made her sick
White powder in the air
She's got no bones
And can't be scared

Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea girls

Here comes Johnny Bore
He collapsed on the floor
They shot him up with milk
And when he died
Sold him for silk

Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea girls

Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea girls
