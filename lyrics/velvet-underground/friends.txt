How can I tell her?
What can I say?
We've been friends for so long
Never knew it could go wrong


When I look at her
Words just won't come
When I try to write them
Found I couldn't recite them

And the dawn comes running to my room
And the time for telling is coming soon

She's a believer
That's what she said
When I look in her eyes
All I see is goodbye

And the dawn comes running to my room
And the time for telling is coming soon

How can I tell her?
What can I say?
We've been friends for so long
Never knew it could go wrong

Friends for so long
So long
