Wrap your troubles in dreams
send them all away
Put them in a bottle
and across the seas they'll stay


Speak not of misfortune
speak not of your woes
Just steal yourself a Holy death
crouching by the door

Ride and sway to music's pain
searing with the sides
Caress death with a lover's touch
for it shall be your bride

Wrap your troubles in dreams
send them all away
Put them in a bottle
and across the seas they'll stay

Purple is to yellow
as sunlight is to rain
Happiness and death you'll find
loveliness in pain

Slash the golden whip it snaps
across the lover's sides
The earth trembles without tremors
preparing for to die

Wrap your troubles in dreams
send them all away
Put them in a bottle
and across the seas they'll stay

Salty ocean waves and sprays
come crashing to the shore
Bullies kick and kill young loves
down on bar-room floors

The gleaming knife cuts early
through the midnight air
Cutting entrance in its path
blood runs without care

Violence echoes through the land
in heart of every man
The knife, it stabs existent wounds
puss runs through meant to tear

Excrements filters through the brain
hatred bends the spine
Filth covers the body pores
to be cleansed by dying time

Wrap your troubles in dreams
send them all away
Put them in a bottle
and across the seas they'll stay
