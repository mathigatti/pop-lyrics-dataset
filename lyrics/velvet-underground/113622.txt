Jenny said when she was just five years old
There was nothin' happenin' at all
Every time she puts on a radio
There was nothin' goin' down at all
Not at all
Then one fine mornin' she puts on a New York station
You know, she don't believe what she heard at all
She started shakin' to that fine fine music
You know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll
Despite all the amputations you know you could just go out
And dance to the rock 'n' roll station


It was alright
It was allright
Hey baby
You know it was allright
It was allright

Jenny said when she was just bout five years old
You know my parents are gonna be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Well you know it ain't gonna help me at all
Not just a little tiny bit
Then one fine mornin' she turns on a New York station
She doesn't believe what she hears at all
Ooh, She started dancin' to that fine fine music
You know her life is saved by rock 'n' roll
Yeah, rock n' roll
Despite all the computations
You could just dance to that rock 'n' roll station

And baby it was allright
And it was alright
Hey it was allright
It was allright
Hey here she comes now!
Jump! Jump!

Like Jenny said when she was just bout' five years old
Hey you know there's nothin' happenin' at all
Not at all
Every time I put on the radio
You know there's nothin' goin' down at all
Not at all
But one fine mornin' she hears a New York station
She doesn't believe what she heard at all
Hey, not at all
She started dancin' to that fine fine music
You know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll
Yeah rock 'n' roll
Ooh, Despite all the computations
You know you could just dance to the rock 'n' roll station

Allright, allright
And it was allright
Oh, you listen to me now
And it was allright
C'mon now
Little better
Little bit
It was allright
It was allright
And it was allright, allright
It's allright, allright
Baby it's allright, now
Allright, baby it's allright, now
Baby it's allright, allright now
