Ain't it a shame
You're too old to get around
But everybody knows you used to dance to "Hootchy Cool" *?
Just can't shake it like you used to do
Louise


Louise you used to work so hard
No one could compare
Always used to build a house
They came from everywhere

Men would scream
The ladies faint
The childrens weren't allowed
No one on another *? could ever *? a crowd

That was a long time ago
How you keep it up I just don't know

Louise take it all back in town
Ain't it a shame
You're too old to get around
But everybody knows you used to dance to "Hootchy Cool" *?
Just can't shake it like you used to do
Louise, Louise

Younger girls keep coming up anxious for a chance
They *? in to college, got degrees and modern dance
Things keep getting rougher know

Older teens are getting *?
Tassels just don't stick

That was a long time ago
How you keep it up I just don't know

Louise take it all back in town
Ain't it a shame
You're too old to get around
But everybody knows you used to dance to "Hootchy Cool" *?
Just can't shake it like you used to do
Louise, Louise

Louise, ooh
It's so very hard
Every day snips away
Away, away
