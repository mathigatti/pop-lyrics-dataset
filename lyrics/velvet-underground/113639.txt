Lady Godiva, dressed so demurely
Pats the head of another curly-haired boy
Just another toy


Sick with silence, she weeps sincerely
Saying words that have oh so clearly been said
So long ago

Draperies wrapped gently around her shoulder
Life has made her that much bolder now
That she has found out how

Dressed in silk, latin lace and envy
Pride and joy of the latest penny-fare
Pretty passing care

Hair today now dipped in the water
Making love to every poor daughter's son
Isn't it fun?

Now today, propping grace with envy
Lady Godiva peers to see if anyone's there
And hasn't a care

Doctor is coming, the nurse thinks sweetly
Turning on the machines that neatly pump air
The body lies bare

Shaved and hairless, what once was screaming
Now lies silent and almost sleeping
The rain must have gone away

Strapped securely to the white table
Ether causes the body to wither and writhe
Underneath the white light

The doctor arrives with a knife and baggage
Sees the growth, just so much cabbage
That must now be cut away

Now comes the moment of great, great decision
The doctor is making his first incision
One goes here
And one goes there

The ether tube's leaking, says someone who's sloppy
The patient, it seems, is not so well sleeping
The screams echo off the walls

Don't panic -- someone give him pentathol instantly
The doctor removes his blade cagily slow from the brain

By my count of ten
The head won't move!
