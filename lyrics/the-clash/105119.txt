They said: Release Remote Control
But we didn't want it on the label
They said: Fly to Amsterdam
The people laughed, but the press went mad
Oh, someone's really smart
Oh, complete control, yeah that's a laugh


On the last tour my mates they couldn't get in
I'd open up the back door but they'd get run out again
And at every hotel we was a'met by the law
Come for the party, come to make sure
Oh, have we done something wrong?
Oh, complete control, even over this song

You’re my guitar hero

They said we'd be artistically free
When we signed that bit of paper
They meant: Let's make a lots of money
And worry about it later
Oh, I'll never understand
Oh, complete control, let me see your other hand

I don’t trust you, why should you trust me?
Huh?
All over the news spread fast
They’re dirty, they're filthy, they ain't a'gonna last
This is Joe public speaking (Total)
I'm controlled in the body (C-O-N control), I'm controlled in the mind
This is punk rockers (Total)
We're controlled in the price of the hard drugs we can find (C-O-N control)

(Total, C-O-N control)
(Total, C-O-N control) Parents control

We gotta work it up and bring it up and fight it and write it
(C-O-N control) And that means you!
I kick it, I fight it, I get it out, write it
(C-O-N control)
I gotta kick it up
