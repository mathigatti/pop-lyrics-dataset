Now lightning strikes in old
New york
It may be dark but i wanna talk
It might rain, it might snow
Too many things i got to know
If this is spring than it's time to sing
Never mind the l'il birdies wing
Look out, look out, old new york
New york's coming an' new york talks
Hey! strike! not once...
Strike! but twice!


Get out your money - peel a slab
Roll some notes an' hail a cab
Drive in church drive in back
Drive down seventh in a tank
Take in the sights, feel the breeze
See new york's one and only tree
It can be found in garbage park
But don't inspect it after dark
Strike! new york! lightning!
Not once but twice.

Accidental hike in the transit strike
Roller skate or ride a bike
Three to a car, brooklyn bridge
You won't get far if you're privileged
Graffiti jack sprays in black
An englishman can he read it back?
Deli joe he ought to know
He runs the gang on pastrami row
Strike! lightning strike!

Because glass to glass, street to street
Buildings touch st. peter's feet
From car to bar, prez to shah
Everything is in the jar
The 4 winds blow cos the 4 winds know
Takes a special hustle to make a roll
Honey girl on her feet
I wish everything to make her sweet
Strike! twice! ok so roll!
From harlem! strike one!

Harlem slum to penthouse block
On every door i already knocked
There wasn't anybody that i didn't leave alone
Somebody lying under every stone
Everything that a man could need
In a bag down by my knee
That looks good, this ain't got seeds
Cheaper than booze down in the bowery
Lightning strike! old new york!
Everything's light! strike!

Hey ho such a night
I'll see y'all when the lightning strike
A polaroid caught in the act
You're married too and that's a fact
But i won't peek and i won't squeek
Down by the trucks on christopher street
It's cuban day - oi vey
Chinese new year let's call it a day
Tootsie! hey chi man!
That melody is puerto rican
Hey chi man is what he's speaking
An' there's the road down into london town
Where many cars get broken down
It's the westway from ladbroke grove
Runs down to old hounslow
Just thought i'd mention the new extention
That run's down the 59th street intersection
Did you hear the news y'all?
London town on the broadway!
