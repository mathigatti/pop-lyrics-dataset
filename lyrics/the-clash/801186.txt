Gotta sing my song

Now Louie, Louie
Come on, help me sing this song


I walked down the street
On saturday night
I go to the joint
Where they're havin' a fight
I jump all around
I jump up and down
I can't find my baby
She can't be found, let's go

Louie, Louie, oh baby
Baby, Louie, Louie
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Louie, Louie, yeah baby
Louie, Louie

Come on, let's...

I love every girl
I see on the street
.....
I'd like to meet
I walk around all day
And com the street
I know when the bitter
I went with the sweet, let's go

Louie, Louie, oh baby
Baby, Louie, Louie
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Louie, Louie, yeah baby
Louie, Louie

Let's go one more time
Here we go
Louie, Louie...

Something is worrying me
( Redding &amp; Walden )
Something keeps worrying me, yeah
And that something
Keeps driving me in misery
I can tell the way things changed
That you been lovin' some other man
That's why something
Keeps on worrying me
Yes it is
That's why something keeps worrying me

I can tell by the look in your eye
I can tell by the way you smile
I know things haven't been this way
I tried to love you each and every day
And that something keeps on worrying me
That's why something
Keeps driving me in misery

I can tell by the look in your eye
That you been lovin' some other guy
That's why something
Keeps on worrying me
Oh yes it is
That's why something
Keeps on worrying me

Darling, that something, baby
Is deep down in my heart
It's worrying me, baby
I know you love somebody
I know you have somebody, yeah
It's worrying me, baby
I need you right here by my side...
