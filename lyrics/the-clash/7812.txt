Darling, you've got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here 'til the end of time
So you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?


It's always tease, tease, tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day is fine, next is black
So if you want me off your back
Well, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So come on and let me know

This indecision's bugging me
(Esta indecision me molesta)
If you don't want me, set me free
(Si no me quieres, líbrame)
Exactly who I'm supposed to be?
(Digame que tengo ser)
Don't you know which clothes even fit me?
(¿Sabes que ropan me quedan?)
Come on and let me know
(Pero que tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow?
(¿Me debo ir o quedarme?)

Split!
Soplo
¿Me enfrío o lo soplo?

Should I stay or should I go now?
(¿Yo me enfrío o lo soplo?)
Should I stay or should I go now?
(¿Yo me enfrío o lo soplo?)
If I go there will be trouble
(Si me voy va haber peligro)
And if I stay it will be double
(Si me quedo es doble)
So you gotta let me know
(Me tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow?
(¿Yo me enfrío o lo soplo?)

Should I stay or should I go now?
(¿Yo me enfrío o lo soplo?)
If I go there will be trouble
(Si me voy va haber peligro)
And if I stay it will be double
(Si me quedo es doble)
So you gotta let me know
(Me tienes que decir)
Should I stay or should I go?
