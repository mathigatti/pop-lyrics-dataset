You aint no little angel, no more
You turned into a stranger, what for ?
Just how far can you go ?
Oh who knows ?


You think I'm entertainming oh oh
Can you see a danger ? oh oh
You're on your way
You're going further every day

Now I've got to let you go, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
And I've got to let you know, oh oh oh oh
Close the door, you didn't see
Don't you know I'm a beauty queen yeah

You say you wanna make-up oh oh
But hey it's time to wake up oh oh
Just how far will I go ?

Oh they float around inside my head
And you think you got the best of me
But hey, it's just like the history yeah
