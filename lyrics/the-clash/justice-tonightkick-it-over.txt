stay around don't play around
this old town and all
seems like i got to travel on


a lot of people won't get no supper tonight
justice tonight

runnin and a hiding tonight
justice tonight

remember to kick it over
no one will guide you through armegideon time
it's armagideon
it's not christmas time

a lot of people
a lot of people use a calculator
a lot of people won't get no supper tonight
a lot of people sittin' down by the light

the battle is gettin hotter
armagideon time
armagideon

remember to kick it over
armagideon time

a lot of people ain't got no supper tonight
a lot of people got to stand out back
