Trailers for sale of rent
Rooms to let 50 cents, now
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes


Now two hours of shoving broom
But an eight-by-twelve four bed room
I'm a man of means by no means
King of the road

Third box-car on the midnight tube
Destination Hangar Lane
Old worn out suit and shoes
I don't pay no union blues

I smoke old stogies I have found
Short but not to big around
Man of means by no means
King a' the road
