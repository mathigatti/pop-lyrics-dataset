Must i get a witness? for all this misery
There's no need to, brothers everybody can see
That its one more time in the ghetto you know
One more time if you please now
One more time to the dying man
They say one more time if you please


The old lady kicks karate
For just a little walk down the street
The little baby he knows kung fu
He tries it on those he meets
Cos its a one more time!

You don't need no silicone to calculate poverty
Watch when watts town burns again
The bus goes to montgomery

Cos it's a one more time in the ghetto
One more time if you please
One more time for the dying man
One more time to be free
