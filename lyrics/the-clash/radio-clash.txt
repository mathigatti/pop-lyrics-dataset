This is Radio Clash
Stealing all transmissions
Beaming from the mountaintop
Using aural ammunition


With extreme prejudice
On a terminator mission
This is Radio Clash
Consider your position

Step it up, get down low

Breaking news flash

Stealing all transmission
Beaming from the mountaintop
Aural ammunition

A riggy diggy dig dang dang

Stealing information

Use careful confirmation

Bribery, extortion
Legal legislation
Security is life indeed
Accept no other explanation

This is Radio Clash
On pirate satellite
Orbiting your living room
Everybody hold on tight
