Standin' in the bog of a West End bar
Guy on the right leanin' over too far
Money in my pocket gonna put it in the slot
Open up the pack see what type I got


I didn't want to hold you
I didn't want to use you
Protex, Protex blue
All I wanna do

It's a fab protective for that type of a girl
But everybody knows that she uses it well
It's the therapeutic structure I can use at will
But I don't think it fit my B.D. drill

I didn't want to hold you
I didn't want to use you
Protex, Protex blue
All I wanna do

Protex, protex blue
All I wanna do

Sittin' in a carriage of a Bakerloo
Erotica my pocket got a packet for you
Advert on the escalator on my way home
I don't need no skin flicks, I wanna be alone

I didn't want to hold you
I didn't want to use you
Protex, Protex blue
All I wanna do, ooh, ooh, ooh

Johnny, Johnny!
