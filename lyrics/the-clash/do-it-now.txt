We're the capella
Turn the musica
Now they lock 'em out
You gotta come, the world is ours!


Lenny come to make it
1953
With the record in the suitcase
Minus fifty degree

And everywhere you go, they're staring at you face
You got no place to go
And everywhere you go, is out of place
The word you hear is "no"

So what d'you gonna do?
You gotta make the scene come true
Hey!

We're the capella
Turn the musica
Now they lock 'em out
You gotta come, the world is ours!

Hey, do you play for us now
Or are you in the top ten?
What throw the average painter
Get and come back again

And everywhere you go, they're staring at you face
You got no place to go
And everywhere you go, is out of place
The word you hear is "no"

So what d'you gonna do?
You gotta make the scene come true
Hey!

We're the capella
Turn the musica
Now they lock 'em out
You gotta come, the world is ours!

Yeah, the scene is robber
And you must have membership
Know those under leather
And they got too many zits

And everywhere you go, they're staring at you face
And you got no place to go
And everywhere you go, is out of place
The word you hear is "no"

So what d'you gonna do?
You gotta make the scene come true
Hey!

We're the capella
Turn the musica
Now they lock 'em out
You gotta come, the world is ours!

We're the capella
Turn the musica
Now they lock 'em out
You gotta come, the world is ours!!!
