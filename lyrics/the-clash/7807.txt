Charlie don't surf and we think he should
Charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good
Charlie don't surf for his hamburger mama
Charlie's gonna be a napalm star


Everybody wants to rule the world
Must be something we get from birth
One truth is we never learn
Satellites will make space burn

We been told to keep the strangers out
We don't like 'em starting to hang about
We don't like 'em over town
Across the world we're gonna blow 'em down

The reign of the superpowers must be over
So many armies can't free the earth
Soon the rock will roll over
Africa is choking on their coca-colas

Charlie don't surf and we think he should
Charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good
Charlie don't surf for his hamburger mama
Charlie's gonna be a napalm star

There's a one-way street in a one horse town
A lot of one way people starting to brag around
You can laugh, put 'em down
These one way people gonna mow us down

Gung ho gung ho
