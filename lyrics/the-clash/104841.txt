You must treat your lover girl right
If you wanna make lover's rock
You must know a place you can kiss
To make lover's rock
Everybody knows it's a crying shame
But nobody knows the poor babie's name
When she forgot that thing that she had to swallow


You western man, you're free with your seed
When you make lover's rock
But woops, there goes the strength that you need
To make real cool lover's rock
A genuine lover takes off his clothes
And he can make a lover in a thousand go's
An' she don't need that thing that she had to swallow
