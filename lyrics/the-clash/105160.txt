One emotion
It's all over the place
You let it get out
It cuts in your face


One emotion
Back of a shop
Everybody wants what the next guy's got

One emotion
One emotion
All you ever know
Is your narrow life
One emotion

One emotion
Don't think i don't trust
People trample people on the daily bus

One emotion
Fighting through the night
And if you can keep your buttons down
When it gets right

One emotion
One emotion
All you ever know
Is your narrow life
One emotion

One emotion
Smokin' through the town
Banging on the doors
And (???)

One emotion
Boy meets girl
Smashing (???)
It's that kind of world

One emotion
One emotion
All you ever know
Is your narrow life
One emotion

One emotion
Moving out loud
Better get your weapon ready
Walking through the crowd

One emotion
Back of a shop
Everybody wants what the next guy's got

One emotion
One emotion
All you ever know
Is your narrow life
One emotion

One emotion
Emotion
