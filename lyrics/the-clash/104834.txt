Well, I got a friend who's a man
(Who's a man?) what man?
The man who keeps me from the lovely, the only


He gives me what I need
(What you need?) what you got?
I need it all so badly

Oh, anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it, but not for free
It's hateful
And it's paid for and I'm so grateful to be nowhere

This year I've lost some friends
(Some friends?) what friends?
I dunno, I ain't even noticed

You see, I gotta go out again
(Again?) my friend
I gotta see that mainman

Oh, anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it, but not for free
It's hateful
And it's paid for and I'm so grateful to be nowhere

I killed all my nerves
(My nerves?) what swerves?
And I can't drive so steady
And already

I've lost my memory
(My mind?) behind!
I can't see so clearly

Oh, anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it, but not for free
It's hateful
And it's paid for and I'm so grateful to be nowhere
