No! gangboss no!
We don't want the whip!


As you get weaker - it will get harder
So don't be like him
Keep your bones of effort and strngth
Don't sell them to him

We don't want no gangboss
We want to equalize
To my fathers fathers fathers father
Work was no joy
When his son had grown of age
You got to work now boy
Never ceasing for many years
Want to follow that boy?

Till half and half is equalized
Put down the tools
See the car see the house
See the fabulous jewels
See the world you have built it with shoulders of iron
See the world but it is not yours say the stealers of zion

Geneva
Wall street
Who makes them so fat?
Well well me an' you better think about that
In overdrive whooo

Till humanize is equalize
Put down the tools
Every face on every side
Throw down the tools
Stay at home
Don't check with rome paint strike on the door
It's one to one the fight is on so don't go to war

We don't need no gangboss
We have to equalize
