I wasn't going that far
The junkie slip!
I said i wasn't doin' it
The junkie slip!
Yea thought i'd find a rhythm in the junkie town
Thought i'd find a rhythm when the junkies hang around


Thought i'd go out walking to the junkie kind of beat
Setting on those bars that the junkies meet
The junkie slip!
Nail it down
The junkie slip!
This side of town
The junkie slip!
And whatcha knowing before you's a doin
The things they's a-knowing
You pawn your coat and your car
Pawned your cigar and your old guitar
You pawned your guitar and your saxaphone
You're pawning everything in your mother's home

Cos it's a junkie slip!
Just like rock n' roll
A junkie slip!
Like johnnny did the stroll
And you know it feels alright
But what's that feeling on a saturday night?

You're itching itching itching in your pillow in the day
You're itching itching itching and you gave your coat away
Itching itching itching and then in your sleeping bag
There's a little packet that youthought you never had

It's a junkie slip!
Every night
Junkie slip!
Cold water fright
It's a junkie slip
And an old spoon cooky cooky cooky kooky afternoon
All afternoon and in the middle of the night

You're worse for the difference and it don't sleep tight
Don't pull the curtains fon't put on the light
C-c-c-cos it's a junkie slip!
What's goin' on?
Was early night
I lit the fire
Finish alright
Yeh edi-edi-edi-yeh edi-juan
Him going to live with indian
Come in the car, it's an old machine
Riding from brookway on a magazine
Be on that corner with a magazine

Do ya do ya do ya follow your friends?
Do i hear you saying that you're going back again?
It's a junkie slip!
Where? did it end?
But did it ah did it did it ever end?
When did it ever end?
Don't ask me when on a wednesday night
Don't ask me when on a thrusday night
I said oh? who the hell are you?
You said oh! well you met me
I said i can guess why
