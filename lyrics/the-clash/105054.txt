In 1977 I hope I go to heaven
Cos I been too long on the dole
And I can't work at all


Danger stranger
You better paint your face
No Elvis, Beatles, or The Rolling Stones
In 1977

In 1977
Knives in West 11
Ain't so lucky to be rich
Sten guns in Knightsbridge

Danger stranger
You better paint your face
No Elvis, Beatles, or The Rolling Stones
In 1977

In 1977
You're on the never never
You think it can't go on forever
But the papers say it's better
I don't care 'cos I'm not all there
No Elvis, Beatles, or The Rolling Stones

In 1977
Sod the Jubilee
In 1978
In 1979
Stayed in bed
In 1980
In 1981
The toilet don't work
In 1982
In 1983
Here come the police
In 1984
