And so we say
We ain't got life
Don't want a cardboard cut-out
Don't want a plastic knife


Now i know, time can march
With it's chargin' feet
Now i know, words are only cheap
It's gonna be a burn out
All around this town
The south is up
But the north is down

There's gonna be a killin'
Of a woman and a man
Trying to feed that child
Without a coin in their hand

And so we say
Have you no use
For eight million hands
And the power of youth

Now i know, time can march
With it's chargin' feet
Now i know, words are only cheap
It's gonna be a burn out
All around this town
The south is up
But the north is down

There's gonna be a killin'
Of a woman and a man
Trying to feed that child
Without a coin in their hand

It's gonna be a burn out!

And so we say
We ain't diggin' no graves
We're diggin' a foundation
For a future to be made

Now i know, time can march
With it's chargin' feet
Now i know, words are only cheap
It's gonna be a burn out
All around this town
The south is up
But the north is down

There's gonna be a killin'
Of a woman and a man
Trying to feed that child
Without a coin in their hand

It's gonna be a burn out!
