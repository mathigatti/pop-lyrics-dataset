So you're on the floor, at 54
Think you can last - at the palace
Does your body go to the to and fro?
But tonight's the night - or didn't you know
That ivan meets g.i. joe


He tried his tricks- that ruskie bear
The united nations said it's all fair
He did the radiation - the chemical plague
But he could not win - with a cossack spin

The vostok bomb - the stalin strike
He tried every move - he tried to hitch hike
He drilled a hole - like a russian star
He made every move in his repertoire

When ivan meet g.i. joe

Now it was g.i. joe's turn to blow
He turned it on - cool and slow
He tried a payphone call to the pentagon
A radar scan - a leviathan

He wiped the earth - clean as a plate
What does it take to make a ruskie break?
But the crowd are bored and off they go
Over the road to watch china blow!

When ivan meets g.i. joe
