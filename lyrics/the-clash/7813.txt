Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shakin' to the top
The sheik he drove his Cadillac
He went a cruisin' down the ville
The muezzin was a' standing
On the radiator grille


Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy casbah sound
But the bedouin they brought out
The electric camel drum
The loco guitar picker
Got his guitar picking thumb
As soon as the Shareef
Had cleared the square
They began to wail

Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

Now over at the temple
Oh, they really pack 'em in
The in-crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff
Of that crazy casbah jive

Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
Sharia don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

The king called up his jet fighters
He said you better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way

As soon as the Shareef was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare

As soon as the Shareef was
Outta their hair
The jet pilots wailed

Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
He thinks it's not kosher
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Fundamentally he can't take it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

Shareef don't like it
You know he really hates it
