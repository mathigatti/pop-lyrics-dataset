Standing in a queue of a school canteen
Guys on the corner they were laughin' at me
But i don't mind if they see it all
You know i gotta come clean
I gotta come clean
I got a crush on you


My mind don't need it but my body do
A little bit of loving and attention for you
Although we're only strangers
They don't need to know
I gotta cum clean, i gotta cum clean
Ooh, i got a crush on you

I wanna get serious right away
1-2, i got a crush on you
What you doin' today or any other day?
1-2, i got a crush on you
Just one look and i go insane
1-2, i got a crush on you

Your daddy never comes to get you
`cos lives so far away
But his i-talian chauffeur shows up every day
But i'll get you in the corner, i'll get you all
Alone
I gotta cum clean, i gotta come clean

I got a crush on you

1-2, i got a crush on you
1-2, i got a crush on you
1-2, i got a crush on you
I said 1-2
I got a crush on you

Why should i get a crush on you?
