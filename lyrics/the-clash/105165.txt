Well i'm running police on my back
I've been hiding police on my back
There was a shooting police on my back
And the victim well he wont come back


I've been running monday tuesday wednesday
Thursday friday saturday sunday
Running monday tuesday wednesday
Thursday friday saturday sunday

What have i done?

Yes, i'm running down the railway track
Could you help me? police on my back
They will catch me if i dare drop back
Won't you give me all the speed i lack

I've been running monday tuesday wednesday
Thursday friday saturday sunday
Running monday tuesday wednesday
Thursday friday saturday sunday

What have i done?
What have i done?
