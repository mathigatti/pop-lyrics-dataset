White riot
I wanna riot
White riot
A riot of my own
White riot
I wanna riot
White riot
A riot of my own


Black men got a lot of problems
But they don't mind throwin a brick
White people go to school
Where they teach you how to be real thick
And everybody's doin
Just what they're told to
An nobody wants
To go to jail

All the power's in the hands
Of the people rich enough to buy it
While we walk the streets
Too chicken to even try it
An everybody's doin
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail

Are ya takin over
Or are ya takin orders?
Are you goin backwards
Or are you goin forwards?
