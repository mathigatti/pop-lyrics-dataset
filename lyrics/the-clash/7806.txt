What are we going to do now?
Taking off his turban, they said is this man a jew?
'Cos they're working for the clampdown
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you!
When we're working for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers


The judge said five-to-ten, but I say, "Double that again"
I'm not working for the clampdown
No man born with a living soul.
Can be working for the clampdown
Kick over the wall, cause governments to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
D'you know how you can use it?

The voices in your head are calling
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming
Only a fool would think, someone could save you
The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothing, so, boy, get running
It's the best years of your life they want to steal

You grow up and you calm down
You're working for the clampdown
You start wearing the blue and brown
You're working for the clampdown
So you got someone to boss around
It makes you feel big now
You drift until you brutalise
You made your first kill now

In these days of evil presidentes
Working for the clampdown
But lately one or two has fully paid their due
For working for the clampdown
But ha! Gitalong! Gitalong!

And I've given away no secrets
Who's Barmy now?
