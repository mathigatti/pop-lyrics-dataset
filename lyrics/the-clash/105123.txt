Is the music of grove skin rock
Soaked in the diesel of was boys war?
Blood, black gold and the face of a judge
Is the music calling for a river of blood?


Beat the drums tonight, alphonso
Spread the news all over the grove
The big meeting has decided
That total was must burn on the grove

Does it mean i should take my machete
To chop my way through the path of life?
Does it mean i should run with the dog pack
Is that the way to be the one to survive?

Never need a gun says tai chi
Move on up to dragon snaps his tail
Fall back on still waters
Hammer with his eye on the nail

Spread the word tonight please, sammy
They're searching everyhouse on the grove
Don't go alone now, sammy!
The wind has blown away the corner soul

Tell the news for me, sammy
They're searching every place on the grove
But don't go down alone new, sammy!
The wind has blown away the croner soul

Is the music calling for a river of blood?
