Hey anybody got a cigarette?

Has anybody got a cigarette
Haven't you declared a disaster zone
Ho! your car is a total wreck
And i just can't go back home


My girl if she had the dope
We'd get the messieurs on the phone
I still got to get up and go home
Don't start driving on my headstone

Go!
Life is wild life is free
Make him want to stop, gonna fall on me
Life is wild life is free
Make him want to stop, gonna (???) me

Here's to all of my kindred souls
He got a life but ain't got no style
Well heard that your story goes
You nearly broke down after half a mile

Hey that is the way it goes
You better keep a note on file
You'll have to reap what i suppose
Gets you a floor and a (???)

Life is wild life is free
Make him want to stop, gonna fall on me
Life is wild life is free
Make him want to stop, gonna (???) me

Somebody got a cigarette?
A guitar or a blank cassette
Hey! the last thing he'd expect in his bar
Gonna chart the rise of my star

Life is wild life is free
Make him want to stop, gonna fall on me
Life is wild life is free
Make him want to stop, gonna (???) me
