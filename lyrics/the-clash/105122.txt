Rebels on the corner
Rebels to the core
Got a million dollar question
What is livin' for?


Hey! man can scratch a livin'
In a fat man's city class
The teacher is survival
But soon the present will be the past

So!
Be cool under heat
Be cool under heat
Be cool on the street
Be cool under heat

When you're rockin' down
On a cold hard night
Pitiless eyes of the cityless souls
Narrow in the lights

Sorrow upon sorrow
Go ganging up in your head
You can leave it till tomorrow
If you can balance on the edge

Hey!
Be cool under heat
Be cool under heat
Be cool on the street
Be cool under heat

When the baby and you got to fight
Go cool your love in the rain
When the match refuses to strike
Show that you really are in pain

I'm giving you a warning
Gonna burn those blue suede shoes
Swagger in the mornin'
Prints up front page news

Be cool under heat
Be cool under heat
Be cool on the street
Be cool under heat
