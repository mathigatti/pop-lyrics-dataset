Yankee soldier
He wanna shoot some skag
He met it in Cambodia
But now he can't afford a bag
Yankee a dollar talk
To the dictators of the world
In fact it's giving orders
An' they can't afford to miss a word


I'm so bored with the U, S, A
I'm so bored with the U, S, A.
But what can I do?

Yankee detectives
Are always on the TV
'Cos killers in America
Work seven days a week
Never mind the stars and stripes
Let's print the Watergate Tapes
I'll salute the new wave
And I hope nobody escapes

I'm so bored with the U, S, A
I'm so bored with the U, S, A
But what can I do?
I'm so bored with the U, S, A
I'm so bored with the U, S, A
But what can I do?
I'm so bored with the U, S, A
I'm so bored with the U, S, A
I'm so bored with the U, S, A
But what can I do?

Move up, Starsky
For the C.I.A.
Suck on, Kojak
For the USA
