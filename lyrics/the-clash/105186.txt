Well, I was waiting for your phonecall
The one that never come
Like a man about to burst
I was dying of thirst


Though I will never fade
Or get lost in this daze
Though I will disappear
And join the street parade

It's not too hard to cry
In these crying times
I'll take my broken heart
And take it home in parts

But I will never fade
Or get lost in the daze
Though I will disappear
And join the street parade

I was in this place
The first church of the city
I saw tears on the face
The face of a visionary

Though I will disappear
To join the street parade
Disappear and fade
Into the street parade
