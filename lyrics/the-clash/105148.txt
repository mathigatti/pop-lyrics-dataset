Summon up the mas! play on the pan!
Staring dreads are jerking their locks
As the white star liner sank in the docks
But on the drummers face, there is a look of dread
As he drums away 400 years of dread
The dancer man-in the power of mas
Is smoking ti the mighty sparrow's blast


But you better be careful
You still got to watch yourself

You wanna be crazy
So you wanna go crazy
Let's go crazy
So you wanna be crazy
Then let's go crazy
Let's go crazy

The lawful force are here of course
For special offenders for the special court
But the young men know when the sun has set
Darkness comes to settle the debt
Owed by a year of s.u.s. and suspect
Indiscriminate use of the power of arrest

They're waiting for the sun to set

The mighty observer who keeps his cabinets hot
A great meeting of rhythm and face
A humming of values and a children's place
But the sticks man gives the copper good excuse
To shut off the ganja and control the juice

To control the juice

So you wanna go crazy? then let's go crazy
So take it on crazy! so they get all crazy
Bricks and bottles corrugated iron
Shields and helmets carnival time
'n moa ambassa, sledgehammer sound
Ray symbolic from jamdown town
