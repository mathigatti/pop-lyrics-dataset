I would love to be the lucky one on Chill Avenue
Who could keep your heart warm when ice has turned it blue
But beggin' sleeping losers as they turn in for the night
I'm lookin' back for home and I can see the lights
I should be jumpin' shoutin' that I made it all this way
From Camden Town station on to 44th and 8th
Not many make it this far, many say we're great
But just like them we walk on, we can't escape our fate
Can't you hear the sighin'
Eastside Jimmy and Southside Sue
Both say they needed somethin' new


So I'm standing at the Gates of the West
I burn money at the lights of the sign
The city casts a shadow of the perfect crime
I'm standing at the Gates of the East
I take my pulse and the pulse of my friend
The city casts a shadow, will I see you again?

The immigrants and remnants of all the glory years
Are clustered 'round the bar again for another round of beers
Little Richard's in the kitchen playin' spoons and plates
He's tellin' the waitress he's great
Ah say I know somewhere back 'n' forth in time
Out on the dust bowls, deep in the roulette mine
Or in a ghetto cellar only yesterday
There's a move into the future for the USA
I hear them cryin'
Eastside Jimmy and Southside Sue
Both said they needed something new

So I'm standing at the Gates of the West
I burn money at the lights of the sign
The city casts a shadow of the perfect crime
I'm standing at the Gates of the East
I take my pulse and the pulse of my friend
The city casts a shadow, will I see you again?

Standing at the Gates of the West
In the shadow again
I'm standing at the Gates of the West
In the shadow again
I'm standing at the Gates of the West
In the shadow again
In the shadow again
