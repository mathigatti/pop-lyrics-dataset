Rudie can't fail

Sing, michael, sing-on the route of the 19 bus
Hear them sayin'
How you get a rude and a reckless?
Don't you be so crude and a feckless
You been drinking brew for breakfast
Rudie can't fail


So we reply
I know that my life make you nervous
But i tell you that i can't live in service
Like the doctor who was born for a purpose***
Rudie can't fail

Chorus:
I went to the market to realise my soul
'cause what i need i just don't have
First they curse, then they press me till i hurt
We say rudie can't fail

We hear them sayin'
Now first you must cure your temper
Then you find a job in the paper
You need someone for a saviour
Oh, rudie can't fail

We reply
Now we get a rude and a reckless
We been seen lookin' cool an' a speckless
We been drinking brew for breakfast
So rudie can't fail

Chorus

Okay!
So where you wanna go today?
Hey boss man!
You're looking pretty smart
In your chicken skin suit

You think you're pretty hot
In your pork pie hat
But...rudie can't fail
Look out, look out...
Sky juice!...10 cents a bottle!
