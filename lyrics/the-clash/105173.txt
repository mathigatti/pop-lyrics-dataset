You know he just heard
The drums of war
When the past
Was a closing door


The drums beat into the jungle floor

Chorus
Closing door
Closing door

Rain on the leaves
Soldier sing
You never hear anything

They filled the sky with a tropical storm.

Chorus

You know he head the drums of war
Each man knows what he's looking for
