Drug stabbing time
Well I got working on the Ford line
A paying off the big fine
Drug stabbin' time


Drug stabbin' time
Is from nine to nine
Nobody wantsa user
Nobody needs a loser
So kick him out that door
An' don't answer it no more

Drug stabbin' time
It's a Greenwich Mean Time
Your friends all hate each other you think
You've got another
But who's at the door?
Don't answer it no more

Drug stabbin time
In a bedroom crime
There's a tape recording on a telephone line
An' it's ringin from the floor
So don't answer it no more

Now I was lying in my room
It was raining drugs all afternoon.
I hear this car pull up outside
Comes to a stop like, skreeee

Someone's in a hurry
'N someone better worry
'Cos these four guys all had on their feet
A pair of black shoes shining and neat
I thinks

Blackshoes on
No that's bad news
Here they come charging up the stairs alright
Sonny just tell us where

Drug stabbin time
Don't ask me mate
Working on the Ford line
Paying off the big fine
Drug stabbin' time
