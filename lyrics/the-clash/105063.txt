Are you ready for
Are you ready for
War
War
War


High above the satellites
View the earth
(? ? ? ) nights
Europe switches off those lights

Are you ready for
War, all in all this sentimental
War, wall to wall with the regimental
War, with all the things continental
Are you red

War
War
War

Theres no use runnin a mobile home
Everywhere is a target zone
Hell is ringing on the red, red phone

Are you ready for

War, all that is futuristic
War, all that is realistic
War, all that will be ballistic
Are you red

War
War
War

Are you ready for
Are you ready for

Vodka chilled in the kremlin bar
Ride on the rocky (? ? ? ) and hold my arm
Raise my glass and break it on the bar

Are you ready for
War, all in all this sentimental
War, wall to wall with the regimental
War, with all the things continental
Are you red

Are you ready for
War
War
War
