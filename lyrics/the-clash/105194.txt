Punk rockers, hip-hoppers
Brit poppers, show stoppers
Beboppers, hair droppers
Are you ready to sing?


Right wing, left wing
I want something
To see me through
Bout what do you think

We ain't gonna be treated like trash
We got one thing
We are the clash
What?
We are the clash
We can strike that match
If you can spill the gas

With my guitar now
Last dance
I see them where they
How they usually stay

Beating on a drum
Did they tell them 'take it in'
Got the
Where the fat boy blew

We ain't gonna be treated like trash
We got one thing
We are the clash
That's right
We are the clash
We can strike that match
If you can spill the gas

Home fires burnin'
In motorcycle city
The rockin' gods will choose
If I'm worthy to live
The first engine
Forty-six
And there's no more
To imitate respect

We ain't gonna be treated like trash
We got one thing
We are the clash
Don't take no shit
We are the clash
Do ya hear me?
We can strike that match
If you can spill the gas
