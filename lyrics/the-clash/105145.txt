Stay around don't play around
This old town and all
Seems like i got to travel on


A lot of people won't get no supper tonight
Justice tonight

Runnin and a hiding tonight
Justice tonight

Remember to kick it over
No one will guide you through armegideon time
It's armagideon
It's not christmas time

A lot of people
A lot of people use a calculator
A lot of people won't get no supper tonight
A lot of people sittin' down by the light

The battle is gettin hotter
Armagideon time
Armagideon

Remember to kick it over
Armagideon time

A lot of people ain't got no supper tonight
A lot of people got to stand out back
