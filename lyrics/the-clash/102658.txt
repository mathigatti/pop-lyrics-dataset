Let me tell you 'bout Wayne 
and his deals of cocaine 
a little more every day 
holding for a friend till the band do well 
then the d.e.a. locked him away 


Clang clang, go the jail guitar doors 
Bang bang, go the boots on the floor 
Cry cry, for your lonely mother's son 
Clang clang, go the jail guitar doors 

An' I'll tell you 'bout Pete, 
didn't want no fame 
gave all his money away 
"well there's something wrong, it'll be good for you, son" 
and so they certified him insane 

Clang clang, go the jail guitar doors 
Bang bang, go the boots on the floor 
Cry cry, for your lonely mother's son 
Clang clang, go the jail guitar doors

And then there's Keith, 
waiting for trial twenty-five thousand bail 
if he goes down you won't hear his sound 
but his friends carry on anyway, fuck 'em! 

jail guitar doors 
jail guitar doors
jail guitar doors
jail guitar doors
jail guitar doors
jail guitar doors
jail guitar doors
jail guitar doors
