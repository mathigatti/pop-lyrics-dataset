Yes i am the dictator the more guns i got the better
Yes i am the liquidator i carry the old beretta
You know there once was freedom
You know how dangerous that can be
The people used to dance &amp; sing
&amp; they used to run wild in the streets
But now i am the voice
Howling from your radio
From my armour plated cadillac
You'll hear what i say goes


Yes i am the dictator i satisfy the u.s. team
I always do my killing in the woods &amp; keep the city gutters clean
Cos i need a few more dollars
For my fighter pilot to be free
To dive bomb on the population
If they go running wild in the streets
Yes i am that voice...etc

Yes i am the crusador i spent twenty years in exile
But now i am the invader &amp; i'm never never gonna die
Yes i am the dictator my name is on your ballot sheet
But until my box has your cross you know the form is incomplete
And you know........etc
