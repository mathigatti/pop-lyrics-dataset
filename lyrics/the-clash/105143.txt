Down the road came a junco partner
For he was loaded as can be
He was knocked out, knocked out loaded
He was a'wobblin' all over the street


Singing 6 months ain't no sentence
And one year ain't no time
I was born in angola
Serving 14 to 99

Well i wish i had me $1 million dollars
Oh one million to call my own
I would raise meat and say, "grow for me baby"
I would raise me a tobacco farm

Well i wish i would have me a great deal of money
Yeah and mighty good things all over town
Now i ain't got no more money
All of my good friends are putting me down

So now i gotta pawn my rifle and pistol
Yeah i'm gonna pawn my watch and chain
I would have pawned my seat gabriella
But the smart girl she wouldn't sign her name

Give me headstone when i die
