IT'S LUCY IN THE SKY AND ALL KINDS OF APPLE PIE
SHE GIGGLES AT THE SCREEN 'COS IT LOOKS SO GREEN
THERE'S CARPETS ON THE PAVEMENTS
AND FEATHERS IN HER EYE
BUT SOONER OR LATER, HER NEW FRIENDS WILL REALISE
THAT JULIE'S BEEN WORKING FOR THE DRUG SQUAD


WELL IT SEEMED LIKE A DREAM, TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
STASH IT IN THE BANK WHILE THE TABLETS GROW HIGH
IN THEIR MILLIONS

AND EVERYBODY'S HIGH (HI, MAN...)
BUT THERE'S SOMEONE LOOKING DOWN
FROM THAT MOUNTAINSIDE
'COS JULIE'S BEEN WORKING FOR THE DRUG SQUAD

AND IT'S TEN YEARS FOR YOU
NINETEEN FOR YOU
AND YOU CAN GET OUT IN TWENTY-FIVE
THAT IS IF YOU'RE STILL ALIVE

AN' THEN THERE CAME THE NIGHT OF THE GREATEST EVER RAID
THEY ARRESTED EVERY DRUG THAT HAD EVER BEEN MADE
THEY TOOK EIGHTY-TWO LAWS
THROUGH EIGHTY-TWO DOORS
AND THEY DIDN'T HALT THE PULL
TILL THE CELLS WERE ALL FULL
'COS JULIE WAS WORKING FOB THE DRUG SQUAD

THEY PUT HIM IN A CELL, THEY SAID YOU'RE IN HELL
YOU'VE GOT THE TIME TO COUNT ALL OF YOUR HAIR
YOU'VE GOT FIFTEEN YEARS
A MIGHTY LONG TIME
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN A PHYSICIST
BUT NOW YOUR NAME IS ON THE MAILBAG LIST
JULIE'S BEEN WORKING FOR THE DRUG SQUAD

GUMBO!

AND IT'S TEN YEARS FOR YOU
NINETEEN FOR YOU
AND YOU CAN GET OUT IN TWENTY-FIVE
THAT IS IF YOU'RE STILL ALIVE
