Revolution rock, it is a brand new rock
A bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock


Careful how you move, mac, you dig me in me back
An' i'm so pilled up that i rattle
I have got the sharpeest knife, so i cut the biggest slice
But i have no time to do battle

Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this
Brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma, tell your pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? don't ignore it
Gonna be arl-right

Revolution rock, i am in a state of shock
So bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock

Careful how you slide, clyde, all you did was glide
And you poured your beer in me hat
With my good eye on the beat, living on fixation strete
And i ai't got no time for that
