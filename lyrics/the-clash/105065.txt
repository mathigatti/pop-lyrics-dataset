Stay around dont play around
This old town and all
Seems like I got to travel on


A lot of people wont get no supper tonight
A lot of people wont get no justice tonight
The battle is gettin hotter
In this iration, armagideon time

A lot of people runnin and a hiding tonight
A lot of people wont get no justice tonight
Remember to kick it over
No one will guide you - armagideon time

Ad lib vocals
