Spanish songs in Andalucia
The shooting sites in the days of '39
Oh, please, leave the vendanna open
Fredrico Lorca is dead and gone
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
The black cars of the Guardia Civil
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
I'm flying in on a DC 10 tonight


Spanish bombs, yo te quiero y finito
Yo te querda, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero y finito
Yo te querda, oh mi corazón

Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag
They wore the black one
But after they died it was Mockingbird Hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My senorita's rose was nipped in the bud

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero y finito
Yo te querda, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero y finito
Yo te querda, oh mi corazón

The hillsides ring with: Free the people
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39?
With trenches full of poets
The ragged army, fixin' bayonets to fight the other line
Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearing music from another time
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
I'm flying in on a DC 10 tonight

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero y finito
Yo te querda, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero y finito
Yo te querda, oh mi corazón
Oh mi corazón, oh mi corazón

Spanish songs in Andalucia, Mandolina, oh mi corazon
Spanish songs in Granada, oh mi corazon
Oh mi corazón, oh mi corazón
Oh mi corazón, oh mi corazón
