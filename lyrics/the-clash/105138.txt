They cried the tears, they shed their fears,
Up and down the land,
They stole guitars or used guitars
So the tape would understand


Without even the slightest hope of a 1000 sales
Just as if, as if there was, a Hitsville in U.K.
I know the boy was all alone, til the Hitsville hit U.K.

Remember

They say true talent will allways emerge in time,
When lightening hits small wonder
Its fast rough factory trade
No expense accounts, or lunch discounts
Or hypeing up the charts,
The band went in, 'n' knocked 'em dead, in 2 min. 59
I know the boy was all alone, till the Hitsville hit U.K.

So hit it

No slimy deals, with smarmy eels in Hitsville U.K.
Lets shake and say, we'll operate in Hitsville U.K.
I know the girl felt all alone, till the Hitsville hit U.K.

The mutants, creeps, and musclemen,
Are shaking like a leaf,
It blows a hole in the radio,
When it hasn't sounded good all week,
A mike 'n' boom, in your living room, in Hitsville U.K.
No consumer trials, nor A.O.R., in Hitsville U.K.,

I know the boy felt all alone,
Till the Hitsville hit U.K.

Now the boys and girls are not alone,
Now that Hitsville's hit U.K.

I know the boys and girls are not alone,
Now that Hitsville's hit U.K.

I know the boys and girls are not alone,
Now that Hitsville's hit U.K.

I know the boys and girls are not alone,
Now that Hitsville's hit U.K.
