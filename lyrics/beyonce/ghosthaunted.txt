The winner is: Beyonce Knowles, female pop vocalist!

I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents, who I love. I love you, Houston


And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man, these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder
How come?

Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls 'cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring
All these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm touring
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive

The 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?

What goes up, ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up, ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around

Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh, well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so... Mm

It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm on to you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You like it?
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me!
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm on to you, you must be on to me

It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me
You must be on to me
You must be on to me
You must be on to me

On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you (me)
On to you, I'm on to you (me, me, me)
On to you, I'm on to you (me)
