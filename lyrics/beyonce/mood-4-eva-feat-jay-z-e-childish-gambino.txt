Aa dennin, k'an bɛn sɔgɔma!
Miiri man ɲi!
Aa dennin, k'an bɛn sɔgɔma!
Aa dennin, k'an bɛn sɔgɔma!
Aa dennin, k'an bɛn sɔgɔma!


[Beyoncé]
I know my enemy prey on me, so pray for me
Tick, tick, wait on it
I'm keepin' down my body count
I'm finessin' like a trap bounce, a trap bounce, yeah
'Cause every day above ground is a blessing
I done leveled up now, view panoramic
None of my fears can't go where I'm headed
Had to cut 'em loose, now I'm loose, break the levy, yeah
I'm 'bout to flood on 'em, flood on a sinner
The rain and thunder gon' fall, go Mutumbo, no, no center
You can't dim my light

'Cause when we walk up in the club
I need them sirens goin' off
Then we can look up in the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
It give me goosebumps every time
I threw up my diamond
Together we're big timin'
Don't make me have to remind ya

I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever

[JAY-Z &amp; Beyoncé]
Forever and ever
You heard that?
Forever and ever
That's the sound of the price goin' up

Forever, and ever-ever (yeah, yeah), and ever-ever
At the Saxon Madiba suite (yeah, yeah), like Mandela
Bumpin' Fela on the Puma jet (my daughter), like we from Lagos
Mansa Musa reincarnated (he 'bout business), we on our levels
That's a billi', a thousand milli'
First one to see a B out these housing buildings
I be feelin' like Prince in '84 (ow)
Mike in '79, Biggie in '97, '94 Nas
Ali bomaye! No, kumbaya
Just give me the Sommelier (I got it), I'm on La Tâche
Helmet, on a jetski, you know the vibes
Hit my head, forget I'm me (I love it), oh my God
Without the God in the XY (yeah, yeah)
I'm afraid the whole game would be colonized (yeah, yeah)
The marathon will be televised for NIP
'Cause true kings don't die, we multiply, peace

[Beyoncé]
I'm so unbothered, I'm so unbothered
Y'all be so pressed while I'm raisin' daughters
Sons of empires, y'all make me chuckle
Stay in your struggle, crystal blue water
Piña colada-in', you stay Ramada Inn
My baby father, bloodline Rwanda
Why would you try me? Why would you bother?
I am Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter
I am the Nala, sister of Naruba
Osun, Queen Sheba, I am the mother
Ankh on my gold chain, ice on my whole chain
I be like soul food, I am a whole mood

When we walk up in the club
I need them sirens goin' off
Then we can look up to the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
I give 'em goosebumps every time
I throw up my diamonds
Together we're big timin'
The children are our reminder

I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever

Forever and ever
Ever, forever
Forever and ever
Ever and ever and ever
Time to break it down now

[Childish Gambino]
All praise to
My enemies still praise
Get along
'Cause I've bet on myself
I'm dancin'
Ancestors in my step
Now I move better, ooh
And I live on, on
I feel a change goin' on
Royalty in my blood, run the kingdom
The more money, more problem season
But don't nothin' get you out your way
Rise up higher
Jump, jump and don't look down
You're so far from the ground
You're way

[Beyoncé]
I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever
Forever and ever
