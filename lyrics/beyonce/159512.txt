[Bilal]
Every step I make
And every breath I take
I took cuz I cant wait
To be closer to you


[Beyoncé]
Baby you're so sweet
You give me cavities
I get a stomach ache
If I cant be with you

[Bilal]
At night I fall asleep
And I dont wanna wake up

[Beyoncé]
Cuz you are in my dreams
A heavenly creation

[Both]
In the body that
I only wanna share with you

[Bilal]
Hey

[Chorus]
Everything I do is just for you
Countin every second til we rendezvous
And I cant wait
To give my love to you
Cuz everything I do is just for you


[Be] Baby we will never finish
[Bi] To be continued
[Be] Separation cant change
[Bi] The love I feel for you
[Be] I'm gonna definitely be affectionate
[Bi] Snuggle up tonight lets get real intimate
[Be] Only you can satisfy my appetite
[Bi] Cuz when it comes to love

I wanna taste your lips
My body melts in bliss every time

Everything I do is just for you
Countin every second til we rendezvous
And I cant wait
To give my love to you
