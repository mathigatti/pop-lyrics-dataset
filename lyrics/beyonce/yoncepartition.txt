Lemme hear you say: Hey, Ms. Carter! (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Say: Hey, Ms.Carter! (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Give me some!


See me up in the club with fifty-leven girls
Posted in the back diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

Boy, this all for you
Just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
I do this all for you
Baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's looking, babe
And tell me how I'm looking, babe

Drop the bass, man, the bass get lower
Radio say 'Speed it up', I just go slower
High like treble, puffin' on them mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
'Cause when you wanna smash, I just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor

(Beyoncé? Beyoncé?)
(Are you happy to be in Paris?)
(Are you happy to be in Paris?)
(Beyoncé? Beyoncé?)

(Drunk!)

Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seeing Yoncé on her knees
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara runnin', red lipstick smudged
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky'd all on my gown
Oh, there, daddy, daddy, didn't bring a towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kinda girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me

Driver, roll up the partition fast
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Hand prints and footprints on my glass
Hand prints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blastin'
He like to call me peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip filth talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping tryin' not to crash
Oh, there daddy, daddy, now you ripped my fur
Oh, baby, baby, be sweatin' on my hair
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kinda girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me

Hello!

Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe. Je veux dire, l'activité physique
Le coït
Tu aimes ça?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe
Mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kinda girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me

Hello!
