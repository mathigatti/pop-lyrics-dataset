Thou shall know when he's got to go

[1]
Hey ladies why is it that men can go do us wrong
Why is it that we just decide to keep holdin' on
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength
to leave
But he's got to go he's got to go


Hey ladies why is it that men can go do us wrong
Why is it that we just decide to keep holdin' on
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength
to leave
But he's got to go, he's got to go

My man's been cheatin' on me
Been runnin' round here wit' this little tenderoni
And don't think I haven't noticed
He's been actin' funny
Takin' too long to call me
And somebody told me
That the worst thing of it all is that he gave her
money

Now how he gon' give her my ends
That's a no, no
My first reactions telling me he's got to go, go
But I just ain't for sure
Should I just let him go
Oh I don't know

[2]
Yeah he did me wrong
But I love him so
I keep holding on
But he got to go, he got to go
Thought he was the one
But now I don't know
After what he's done
He's got to go, he's got to go

Repeat 1

You keep rewinding it
Stopin' it and playing yourself over again
See I'm sick and tired of you doin' that same old
thing
Sick of your same routine
Now you've got to come clean
Cause it's killing me

Repeat 2

Repeat 1

I just don't understand
You get chance after chance
And you say that you'll do right
But I really do not know if you can
It's not in your plans
That you've shown
Can you change, don't think so
Now I gotta let you go

Got to go-go-go-go-go
Got to go-go-go-go-go.
