Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time


I'll be your baby
Now, promise not to let you go
I'll love you like crazy
Now, say you'll never let me go

Say you'll never let me go
Say, say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say, say you'll never let me go

Take you away from here
There's nothing between us
But space and time
I'll be your own little star
Let me shine in your world
In your own little universe
Make me your girl

Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night (to kiss you at night)
I will love you until the end of time

I'll be your baby
Now, promise not to let you go
I'll love you like crazy
Now, say you'll never let me go

Say you'll never let me go
Say, say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say, say you'll never let me go

Baby, come on, get up on it
Show me that you really want it
I wanna be the one to love you, baby, let's go (whoa)
Let's go (whoa)

I wanna provide this loving that you're giving
I ain't frontin' in this love
Can you let me love you from your head to toe? (whoa)
Baby, let's go (whoa)

Boy, come to me (come to me!)
Let me turn your rain into sun (come to me, baby!)
You don't have to worry, baby (oh, no!)
I promise I'll set your heart free
Let my love into your soul
You go, I go, we go
That's all she wrote

Say you'll, say, say you'll nev, never
Say you'll, say, say you'll nev, never
Say you'll, say, say you'll nev, never
Say you'll, say, say you'll nev, never
(Can't you see me?)
Say you'll, say, say you'll nev, never
Say you'll, say, say you'll nev, never
(I just wanna love you)
Say you'll, say, say you'll nev, never
Say you'll, say, say you'll nev, never
(Can't you feel me, babe?)
Say you'll, say, say you'll nev, never

I just wanna be with you
I just wanna live for you
I'll never let you go
Bring your love to me

Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night (to kiss you at night)
I will love you until the end of time

I'll be your baby
Now, promise not to let you go
I'll love you like crazy
Now, say you'll never let me go

Say you'll never let me go
Say, say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say, say you'll never let me go
