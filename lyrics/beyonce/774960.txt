You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it
I'm not feelin' it


On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all of that
I'm not feelin' it
I'm not feelin' it

Let's go
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
I think it's time to go
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
He don't want no more
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
Quite frankly
No more gettin' it
I'm not feelin' it

It's like we at two places, but different paces
We in trouble but you won't meet me at the bridge
It hurts, it feels deserted
Did you forget where your heart lives?

What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Actin' like you don't know nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere, I'll be naughty

You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it
I'm not feelin' it

On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all of that
I'm not feelin' it
I'm not feelin' it

Let's go
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
I think it's time to go
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
He don't want no more
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
Quite frankly
No more gettin' it
(Let me show you how to get there, honey)
I'm not feelin' it

Take a left to compassion - the lights really flashing
Keep straight and you'll see the sign right there
Affection - in the wrong direction
If I get caught, see, it just seems that you don't care

What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body
Actin' like you don't know nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere, I'll be naughty

You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it
I'm not feelin' it

On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all of that
I'm not feelin' it
I'm not feelin' it

Let's go
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
I think it's time to go
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
He don't want no more
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
Quite frankly
No more gettin' it
I'm not feelin' it

I'm taking back the things I got from you, you
And that includes my sweet little nooky too, too

(Let's go)
Let's go, let's go little kitty cat (kitty cat)
He don't want you anymore, no

(Let's go)
Let's go, let's go little kitty cat (kitty cat)
He don't want you anymore, no

Rock diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my records
Since sixteen, I was coming down ridin' Lexus'
How you gon' neglect this? You was just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain't gots to lie Craig
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
I'm in the house all alone
You'd rather go and party?
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Actin' like I'm nobody
You gon' make me call somebody

Let's go
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
I think it's time to go
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
He don't want no more
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
No more gettin' it
I'm not feelin' it
