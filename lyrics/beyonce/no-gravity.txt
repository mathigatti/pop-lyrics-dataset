Oh, oh
Oh, oh


I’d rather be dead or crazy, crazy
Than to live without my baby, baby

Everybody wants to be a star (star)
But we got something bigger, (oh)
We got something bigger than that

Look up, up to the stars
Our love, our love is like a universe
Bigger than a universe

Riding in a spaceship
Doing it no gravity
Riding in a spaceship
Love the way you’re grabbing me
Riding in a spaceship
Doing it no gravity, gravity
Love, love, love the way you’re grabbing me

I don’t need no air
Love the way you’re grabbing me
When you’re, when you’re pulling out my hair
I don’t need no air

Baby we can make love in your spaceship
I wanna make love in your spaceship
Let’s do it with no gravity

Even when I’m feeling lazy, lazy
I still couldn’t work 9 to 5 over time
Just for my baby, just for my baby, baby

Everybody wants to be a star, (star)
But we got something bigger, (oh)
We got something bigger than that

Look up, up to the stars (stars)
Our love, our love is like a universe
Bigger than a universe

Riding in a spaceship
Doing it no gravity
Riding in a spaceship
Love the way you’re grabbing me
Riding in a spaceship
Doing it no gravity, gravity
Love, love, love the way you’re grabbing me

I don’t need no air (no I don’t need air)
Love the way you’re grabbing me
When you’re, when you’re pulling out my hair
I don’t need no air (no I don’t need air)

Baby, we can make love in your spaceship
I wanna make love in your spaceship
Let’s do it with no gravity

If I blow a kiss it floats straight to you
All of my loving just gravitates to you
(My sun, my earth, my moon, my everything, everything)
(So high) no there can’t be a limit when (we cross the sky)
Edge of the world is where we begin, begin

So let’s do it with no gravity, (oh)
Do it, do it with no gravity, (oh)

I don’t need no air (I don’t need, I don’t need air)
Love the way you’re grabbing me
When you’re, when you’re pulling out my hair
I don’t need no air (I don’t need, I don’t need no air)

Baby we can make love in your spaceship
I wanna make love in your spaceship
Let’s do it with no gravity

(I don’t no, I don’t need no air)
Let’s do it with no gravity
(I don’t no, I don’t need no air)
Let’s do it with no gravity

(I don’t, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t need no air)
Let’s do it with no gravity
(No, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t need no air)
Let’s do it with no gravity
(No gravity, no gravity, no gravity, no gravity)
