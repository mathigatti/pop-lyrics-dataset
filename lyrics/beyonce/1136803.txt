T.I.:
Hey (I want a soldier)
Well you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' Impalas around
(I got a soldier)
With the top down, feelin' the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' them thighs
Ridin' harder than guys
With the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them flames be spittin' at you, tell 'em don't even try it
To shoot it with 'Chelle, and kick it with Kelly, or holla at B
You gotta be G's, you way outta ya league


Kelly:
We like them boys that be in them Lacs leanin' (leanin')
Open they mouth, they grill gleamin' (gleamin')

They always be talkin' that country slang we like
They keep that beat that be in the back beatin' (beatin')
Eyes be so low from that chiefin' (chiefin')
I love how he keep my body screamin' (screamin')
A rude boy that's good to me, with street credibility

If his status ain't hood, I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things, if you know what I mean

If his status ain't hood, I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough and he better be street

Beyonc√©:
We like them boys up top from the BK (BK)

With that East Coast slang that us country girls, we like
Low-cut caesars with the deep waves (deep waves)
So quick to snatch up yo' Beyonce (Beyonce)
Always comin' down, poppin' our way (our way)
Tellin' us that country girls the kind of girls they like

Lil' Wayne:
Hey, see cash, money is a army
I'm walkin' with Purple Hearts on me
You're talkin' to the sargeant
Body marked up like the subway in Harlem
Callin' em Wizzy F. Baby
Please save the baby
If you don't see me on the block, I ain't tryin'a hide
I blend in with the hood, I'm camouflage
Bandana tied, so Mami, join my troop
Now everytime she hear my name, she salute!

Michelle:

Just might give one the phone tonight (phone tonight)
