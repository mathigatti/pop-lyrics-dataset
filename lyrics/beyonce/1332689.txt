I like to feel so high and
you feel good feeling low
I like my colours vivid
and you paint your colors gone
I like to see the world
and you like your week in tone
but I've been staying behind
while you refused to go


(Chorus)
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight off of my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes owed
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me
and doing the same

(Chorus)
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight above my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lost you honey
I even slowed down thought you'd follow
But you took your own roads honey
'Cause I've been traveling traveling traveling
only to find you
I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind
while you refused to go

(Chorus)
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight above my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
