Haaaa
(Come on baby)
Haaaa
(One night)
Haaaa
(One night only)


You want all my love and my devotion
You want my loving soul right on the line
I have no doubt that I could love you forever
The only trouble is I really don't have the time

I've got one night only
One night only
That's all I have to spare
One night only
Let's not pretend you care

I've got one night only
One night only
Come on, big baby, come on
One night only
We only have 'til dawn
(We only have 'til dawn)
We only have 'til dawn
(We only have 'til dawn!)
One night only
One night only

One night only (Oh)
One night only (Yeah-yeah)

One night only (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
You and I are really running out of time!

Whoo yeah (Come on, come on)
Whoo, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, yeah (Come on, come on)

One night only (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on!
