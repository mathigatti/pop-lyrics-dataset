verse 1:
hey how u doin yeah I'm doin mighty fine
last time I seen u it's been a long time
stop smilin at me get that look off your face
please dont even front stop bein so fake
I know u do not like me yeah u made it very clear
u always talkin bout me from what I hear
always put me down when u thought that u could
I want u to know that I'm doin so good


hook:
wasnt it u that said
I thought I was all that and u
said I didnt have a clue
wasnt it u that said

look at us now see how we live
I stayed down with my people all the ones that keep it

all the things I'm doin that u thought I never could
I want u to know that I'm doin so good

hook:

I thought I was all that and u
said I didnt have a clue
wasnt it u that said
