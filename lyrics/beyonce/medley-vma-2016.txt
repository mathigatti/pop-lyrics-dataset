[Pray You Catch Me]

I tried to make a home out of you
But doors lead to trap doors, a stairway leads to nothing
Where do you go when you go quiet?
The past and the future merge to meet us here


You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath
As you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt
Like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me (Prayin')
I'm prayin' you catch me

[Hold Up]

I tried to change
Fasted for 60 days
Closed my mouth more, wore white, abstained from mirrors
Tried to be softer, prettier, less awake
I bathed in bleach, and plugged my menses with pages from the holy book
But still inside me, coiled deep, was the need to know
Are you cheating on me? Are you cheating on me?

Hello MTV, y'all havin' a good time?
I want y'all to help me to sing this sing
Here we go!

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets
I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless

How did it come down to this?
Going through your call list
I don't want to lose my pride
But I'mma - fuck me up a bitch
I know that I kept it sexy
I know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing
Maybe my head for one

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like bein' walked all over lately
Walked all over lately?
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down

Hey, it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like bein' walked all over lately
Walked all over lately?
I'd rather be crazy

[Sorry]

So what are you gonna say at my funeral now that you've killed me?
Here lies the body of the love of my life
Whose heart I broke without a gun to my head
Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead
Rest in peace, my true love, who I took for granted
Her Heaven would be a love without betrayal
Ashes to ashes... dust to sidechicks

Everybody, let me here you sing!

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
Sing it, sing it now
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry

He tryin' to roll me up
I ain't picking up
I'm headed to this club
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÉ cups
I don't give a *aw*, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my b-, pause, I had enough
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout

Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him: Boy, bye!
Tell him: Boy, bye! Boy, bye!
Middle fingers up
I ain't thinking 'bout you

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
No, no, hell, nah

Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today I've regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them stupid excuses
I pray to Lord you reveal what his truth is

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't thinking 'bout nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie, better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair

[Don't Hurt Yourself]

Oh, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la
Don't hurt yourself

Who the f*ck do you think I am?
You ain't married to no average bitch, boy
You can watch my fat ass twist, boy
As I bounce to the next d*ck, boy
And keep your money, I got my own
Get a bigger smile on my face being alone
Bad mother-mother, God complex
I motivate your ass, call me Malcom X, huh
Yo operator, or innovator
Let them haters, you can't recreate her, no
You'll never recreate her
No, hell, nah, huh, uh

We just got to let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, baby
You just got to let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, babe

When you hurt me, you hurt yourself
Try not to hurt yourself
When you play me, you play yourself
Uh, don't play yourself
When you lie to me, you're lying to yourself
You're only lying to yourself
When you love me, you love yourself
Love god herself

Huh!
We just got to let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, baby

Hey, baby, who the f*ck do you think I am?
I smell that fragrance on your Louis V, boy
Just give my fat ass a big kiss, boy
Tonight I'm f*cking up all your shit, boy

I am the dragon breathing fire
Beautiful mane, I'm the lion
Beautiful man, I know you're lying

[Formation]

Oh, miss B, I know you came to slay
Don't play with the girls, baby
I'm back by popular demand
Oh, yes, you best to believe it
I came to slay, bitch

If y'all came to slay, sing along with me
C'mon

Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess
Paparazzi catch my fly and my cocky fresh
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress
I’m so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces
My daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bamma

I like my baby hair with baby hair and afros
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils
Earned all his money but they never take the country out me
I got hot sauce in my bag, I swag

C'mon, hah

I see it, I want it
I stunt, yellow-bone it
I dream it, I work hard
I grind ‘till I own it
I twirl all my haters
Albino lligators
El Camino with the ceiling low
Sippin’ Cuervo with no chaser

I'm about to go off
I go hard, I go hard
Get what’s mine, take what’s mine
(Here we go)
I’m a star, I’m a star
'Cause I slay, I slay
I slay, I slay
All day, I slay
I slay, okay
Okay

Okay, ladies, now let’s get in formation
Okay, ladies, now let’s get in formation
Prove to me you got some coordination
Slay trick or you get eliminated

Okay, ladies, now let’s get in formation (I slay)
Okay, ladies, now let’s get in formation
You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation
Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper
