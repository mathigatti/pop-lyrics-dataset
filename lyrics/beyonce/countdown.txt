Oh killing me softly
And I'm still falling, still the one I need
I will always be with you
Oh you got me all gone
Don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me you out of yo mind

There's ups and downs in this love
Got a lot to learn in this love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love (hey)
Still love the way he talk
Still love the way I sang
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still love up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the b-b-brain

I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Doing whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line

Me and my boo and my boo boo riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies if you love your man sh -show him you the flyest
Grind up on it girl, show him how you ride it

Me and my boo and my boo boo riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies if you love your man sh -show him you the flyest
Grind up on it girl, show him how you ride it

Killing me softly
And I'm still falling, still the one I need
I will always be with you
Oh you got me all gone
Don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me you out of yo mind

(Ten) Yo mind
(Nine) Yo mind
(Eight) Yo mind
(Seven) Yo mind

Ohh ohh damn I think I love that boy
Do anything for that boy (boyyyy)
Grind up on it girl, show him how you ride it

My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the b-b-brain
Gone in the brain
Gone in the brain
Gone in the, gone in the, gone in the, b-b-brain

Oohh
