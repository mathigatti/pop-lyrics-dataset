Love has truly been good to me 
Not even one sad day 
Or minute have I had since you've come my way 
I hope you know I'd gladly go 
Anywhere you'd take me 


It's so amazing to be loved 
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above 
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...I'd go 

Got to tell you how you thrill me 
I'm happy as I can be 
You have come and it's changed my whole world 
Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow 
What a wonderful day 

It's so amazing to be loved 
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above 
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...I'd go 

And it's so amazing, amazing 
I could stay forever, forever 
Here in love and no, leave you never 
'Cause we've got amazing love 

Truly it's so amazing, amazing 
Love brought us together, together 
I will leave you never and never 
I guess we've got amazing love 

Ooh, so amazing and I've been wondering 
For a love like you 

It's so amazing to be loved 
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above 
Oh, and it's so, it's so 

It's so amazing to be loved 
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above 
And you know, it's so 

It's so amazing to be loved 
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above 
Hey...hey...hey...yeah...it's so 

It's so amazing to be loved 
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above 
Hey...hey...yeah...hey...yeah...yeah...hey...it's so 

It's so amazing to be loved 
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
