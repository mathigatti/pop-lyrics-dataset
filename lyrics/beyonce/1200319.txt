When I first saw you
I said oh my
That's my dream
That's my dream
Oh, I needed a dream
When it all seemed to go bad
Then I find you
And I have had the most beautiful dream
Any man's ever had


When I first say you
I said oh my
That's my dream
That's my dream
Oh, I needed a dream
To make me strong
You were the only
Reason I had to go on

You were my dream
All the things that I'll ever knew
You were my dream
Who could believe they would ever come true
And who could believe
The world would believe
In my dreams too

Before, you appeared
Life was only a game
And day in
And day out
Were the same, oh

Now a dream
Coming true
Like a star
See it shine

A dream
That is yours
That is mine

You were my dream
Now I got dreams of my own
Dreams you'll never know
You won't take my dream from me

When I first saw you
I said oh my
I said oh my
That's my dream
