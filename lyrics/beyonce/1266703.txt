Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else I like
And I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohhh


Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same as last night
And you just don't feel right anymore
I think that we should break up
There's no reason to make up
I won't fight
I? M just tired and I need a change

Sorry boy, but you got me bored, something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied for a little while
I gotta

Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out

Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out

Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else that I like
I really thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohhh

You call me too frequently
I thought it was so sweet in the beggining
But now you're too clingy for me
You don't put the seat down
You don't clean the house how I like it (trifling)
That's reason in up your times expire

Sorry boy, but you got me bored, I gotta move around
If I ain't gotta a ring by now that means I'm not tied down
I gotta

Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out

Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out

Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else that I like
I really thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohhh

I gotta
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out

Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out

Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But still I see something else that I like
I really thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohhh
