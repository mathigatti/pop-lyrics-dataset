Let me sit this ass
On you
Show you how I feel
Let me take this off
Will you watch me?
Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes
Don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like
You can touch me, baby
Do you
Do you wanna touch me, baby?
Grab ahold, don't let go
Let me know
That you
Ready


I just wanna show you now
Slow it down
Go around
You rock hard
I rock steady

So rock right up to
The side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak babe, my peak, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep end, your deep end, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flowing flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
Don't wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me

Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this space
Lemme put it in your face
By the way
If you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create
Rockets and waterfalls

So rock right up to
The side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak babe, my peak, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep end, your deep end, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flowing flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
Don't wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me

Hard rock steady, rock hard, rock steady
Rock hard, rock steady, rock hard, rock steady
Don't you know that I give you
The loving, if you need it?
I give you my word
You can believe it
Your love feels like
All four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason
Swimming
My love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the lord, boy
Kiss me
Pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, 'til the water falls down
Damn

And I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh, child, ooh, now
Yes, lord
Damn, baby
Driving me cray
Cray
You ain't right for doing that to me, daddy
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Tell me what you're gonna do about that
Punish me
Please
Punish me, please
Tell me what you're going to do with all of this
Ass
All up in your face
Yeah, hell yeah
Ride it so deep
Ooh, my shit's so good, it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy

We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures
Cause soon, boy, gonna rock that ching-ching-ching
Baby boomers
Sick little trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're
Comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin
Rockets and waterfalls
