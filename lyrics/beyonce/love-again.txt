I never knew you were so weak to love someone
Always will be loving someone so good and right
His touch was the smoother that I'd seen
I was wishing you were there, but I remember your face
Always when I'm needing of someone, I'm alone and lonely
You were lovely, and I can't forget about you
Sometimes I wanna live on your side, again
But, I won't forget you, won't take it out of my head


Now, I'm trying memorizing your skin touching on mine
I've missed you all this time, where have you been?
I'm confused, and don't know why I'm doing it
'Cause I've been thinking how I've passed my time with you
My mind tells me you won't remember of me
But I like of who you are, and now I'm hopeless
You burned all my eyes, and I'm lifeless
I've been tired wondering if you would do the same

You've been slipping all the times you wanted to say
It was like something I didn't know, and I know now
Your rain is falling on the floor, and I saw you raining
I supposed be in love when I said for you
Now, I'm runnin' trying to find somewhere to go
And I can say "you're pretty, baby"
And I can see everything I haven't seen
So, why are you comin' around of away?
I should've know

I'm numb, trying to remember all the memories
I just wanna be in love, be in love again
I just wanna understand, why are you so pretty
And I can't leave this tears fall again
I don't wanna you see me crying for you
Even that be so hard trying forget everything
I don't wanna you go away, again
I'll be in love again, if you could see me

You've been slipping all the times you wanted to say
It was like something I didn't know, and I know now
Your rain is falling on the floor, and I saw you raining
I supposed be in love when I said for you
Now, I'm runnin' trying to find somewhere to go
And I can say "you're pretty, baby"
And I can see everything I haven't seen
So, why are you comin' around of away?
I should've know

I'm numb, trying to remember all the memories
I just wanna be in love, be in love again
I just wanna understand, why are you so pretty
And I can't leave this tears fall again
I don't wanna you see me crying for you
Even that be so hard trying forget everything
I don't wanna you go away, again
I'll be in love again, if you could see me
