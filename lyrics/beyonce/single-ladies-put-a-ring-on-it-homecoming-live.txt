Up in the club (club), we just broke up (up)
I’m doin' my own lil' thing
You decided to dip (dip), but now you wanna trip (trip)
'Cause another brother noticed me
I’m up on him (him), he up on me (me)
Don’t pay him any attention
I cried my tears (tears), kept me three good years (tears)
You can’t be mad at me

'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it

Now, wait, I want y'all to get nice and stanky with me
Where I'm from, we do things nice and stanky
We do things nice and funky
Can y'all repeat after me? You ready?

If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
