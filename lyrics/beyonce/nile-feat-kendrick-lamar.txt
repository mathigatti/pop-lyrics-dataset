One time I took a swim in the Nile
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear
It made me relax when I came down
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now


Plunging away 'less my body's on top
All of these currents might cost me my life right now
Where danger finds me, it follows with tides
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride

She said: Hey, little buddy, where you goin'?
I'm not sure of how to know I'm still motion
You seem regular, I seem regular
These streams may take me out to the ocean

Told myself if I dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket
Then I'll dive in it 'til I'm exhausted and I'm type lacking
Waistline on four deep
Senses on forty
Feel like there's four of me

One time I took a swim in the Nile
(One time I took in a swim in the Nile)
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear (I swear)
It made me relax when I came down (when I came down)
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now (stimulated now)

Plunging away 'less my body's on top (on top; stimulated now)
All of these currents might cost me my life right now (right now)
Where danger finds me, it follows with tides (follows with tides)
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
That's some good

Got the Nile runnin' through my body
Look at my natural, I'm so exotic
Darker the berry, sweeter the fruit
Deeper the wounded, deeper the roots
Nubian doused in brown, I'm lounging in it
I don't tend to youth, I said I'm drowning in it
I'm in denial, deep in denial
I'm in the Nile, deep in denial
That's some good
