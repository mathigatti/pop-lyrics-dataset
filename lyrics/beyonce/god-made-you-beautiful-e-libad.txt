When you were born
The angels sighed in delight
They never thought they'd see such a beautiful sight


You took the breath
And the world was right again
Tears were shed
How we have been blessed
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside

God made you beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful

God made you beautiful
Beautiful
You're beautiful

Now look at me, you're brought into my life
I kiss those little feet and watch for your perfect smile
And wait it comes, the world's sight in your eyes
I felt love, I found peace of the purest kind
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside

God made you beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful

God made you beautiful
You're beautiful
Beautiful

You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful

God made you beautiful
God made you beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful

God made you beautiful
Beautiful
You're beautiful
