(verse 1)
The day you pissed me off
I told Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin and
I don't like to fuss
He said he would look out for me
if i needed a friend
he took me to his house and then he
invited me in...
then we sat on the couch
he put his arms around my waist
knowin i need lovin then he
gently grabbed my face
he kissed me like a guy could never
kiss a girl before
so you know what happened baby
i need to say no more


(chorus)
All this confessing
about some things i did
I might-as-well come clean
what you feel about that baby
All this confessing
bout the things i did
I might-as-well come clean
what you feel about that baby
All this guessing
are you through with me?
Cause I just came clean
what you feel about that baby
All this guessing
are you through with me?
Cause i just came clean
what you, feel about that...

(verse 2)

Remember the time you wondered
where your money went?
I called my friends
and bought some clothes
and took them on a trip
I met a dude that had a jeep
and we talked all the time
He asked me bout my man
and you know that i had to lie.
He thought i had no man
and i was chillin by my self
Don't get mad
cause i feel sad
thats why i must confess.
So many times i wanted to
let you know my dirt.
But everytime you said
you loved me i knew it would hurt.

(CHORUS)

(Bridge)
I was mad what was i to do
Never had any mind to
play on you
Look at all the hurt you put
me through
I can't tell a lie so I'm
tellin the truth

I was mad what was i to do
Never had any mind to
play on you
Look at all the hurt you put
me through, you know, you know
(repeat)

(CHORUS)

Missy-(Confess, Come clean Boo, yo, what you feel
