O' beautiful, for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain


America, America God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea

America! Can you felling! Stand up! Sing with me! Ohh

O' beautiful, for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain

America, America God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea

America, We Are One!
