And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man
These women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help
But wander
How come?


Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge
I preach my gut it can't help, but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cuz all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring
All these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels I'm touring
All these people on the planet
Working 9 to 5, just to stay alive

The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
All the people on the planet
Working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?

What goes up, ghost around
Goes around around around around
What goes up, ghost around
Ghost around around around around

Sold not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so... Mm
