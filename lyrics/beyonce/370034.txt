It doesn't matter where you been
Or what you did wrong


It doesn't matter who you are
You're always welcome

It only matters that your heart believes
And you confess

If you committed any sin you'll be forgiven

Callin on all of our children
Time to come home
If you wanna be delivered
Time to come home
I've been rescued by the savior
Time to come home
If you wanna be in His favor
Time to come home

Come on home
Come on come on home
oooh yeah yeah
come on home

If you cant see your way out
And you're drowning in your regrets

If you have everything you want
But you still cant find happiness

Cuz when you feel like you're forsaken
Life can be so hopeless

Maybe you need to come home
So your life can be planned

Oooh

God's children
Time to come home
If you wanna be delivered
Time to come home
I've been rescued by the savior
Time to come home
If you wanna be
you need to be
Time to come home

Don't bare the burden all by yourself
(By yourself)
The redeemer's here He's gonna give you help
(Give you help)
Come over here and he will give you rest for any any heart that's heavy laid soul salvation
ooh

Calling all God's children
Time to come home
If you wanna be delivered
Time to come home
I've been rescued by the savior
Time to come home
If you wanna be in his favor
Time to come home

My home
Your home
In his everlasting arms
My home
Your home
In his everlasting arms
Dont you know its time to come home
TIme to come home
Deliver me
I've been rescued by the savior
Dont you wanna be in his favor

In His everlasting arms
My home
Your home
In His everlasting arms
If you wanna be in his favor
My home

In His everlasting arms
