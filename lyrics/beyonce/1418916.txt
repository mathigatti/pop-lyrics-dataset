I wish i could rip out a page of my memory
Cuz i put too much energy in him and me
Can't wait till i get through this phase
Cuz its killing me
Too bad we can't re-write our own history


Such a mystery when he's here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chances fading now, patience running out
This ain't how its supposed to be

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
We gotta re-reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy
Energy, My Energy
Taking all my energy
Energy, My Energy
Taking all of (my energy)

Seems only like yesterday, Not even gravity
Could keep your feet off the ground when u go to me
How can two be as one
We've become to divided now
Theres no use hiding from my misery

Such a mystery when hes here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chances fading now, patience running out
This ain't how its supposed to be

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy (Oh, Yeah)
We gotta re-reverse the chemistry (We gotta re-)
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy
Energy, My Energy
Taking all my energy (Energy)
Energy (Energy), My Energy (Energy)
Taking all of

Bridge:
Now I can feel a change in me
And I can't afford to slip much further
From the person I was meant to be (whoooa)
I'm not afraid to walk alone
Not givin up but movin on
Before it gets too deep
Cause your taking all of my energy

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
We gotta reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy (Oh)
We gotta reverse the chemistry (Oh, Oh)
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy (Energy)
Energy (Energy), My Energy (Oh)
Taking all my energy (Oh-Oh)
Energy, My Energy (Taking all of me)
Taking all of

Ya killing me
Ya taking all of me yeah, oh
This love is taking all of my energy
