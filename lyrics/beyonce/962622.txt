I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and whitout warning
I can be really mean towards you


I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces arenÂ´t even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
Catch me when I fall
Accept my flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that

I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
Catch me when I fall
Accept my flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and whitout warning
I can be really mean towards you

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
Catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
