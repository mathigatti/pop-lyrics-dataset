I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Oh, now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since then, baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far


With me being wherever I'm at
Worried 'bout wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

[Beyoncé]
On my mind up past my bedtime
No rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is
We should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this
And let's get carried away

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Drake &amp; Beyoncé]
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

[Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

From 8 until late I think ‘bout you
Yeah, you own my nights, I don’t know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I've got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Drake &amp; Beyoncé]
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

All I really asking for is you
As long as you know who you belong to

[Drake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (pull up on you)
I gotta pull up on you
You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don’t go ghost on me, I'mma go Thriller on you
I'mma just (pull up on you)
I'mma let my hands do the talking when I see you, baby girl
I miss feeling on you (pull up on you)
I miss everything that's real about you and that's everything about you
That's just how I feel about you (pull up on you)
I been about you and I’m still about you
But we ain't finished talking (pull up on you)
I told you you don’t need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking (pull up on you)
'Cause they don’t wanna see you happier than them, and girl, you swear they all your friends
And there's been a problem (pull up on you)
You the one they hate, just come with daddy
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back (pull up on you)
And you tell me that you’re done with that
And I believe it's true
As long as you know who you belong to

[Beyoncé]
All I’m really asking for is you
Long as you know who you belong to
