Look what you've done to me
I'm losing my mind
You've got the best of me
And it feels so right
You've got a way you work me
It's workin me I
I can't help my emotions when you're dancin close to me


[Chorus] [Refrain]

Sexually healin come and rescue me
(Come and rescue me)
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Cause the way that he move got a girl wanna do something
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh

There's only one of you
Cause you're the real deal
I'm wearing the ring if you feel the way I feel
I'm trying hard to fight your sexual appeal
I can't help my emotions when you're dancin close to me

[Chorus] (x2)
