Oooh
Hello
Oooh
Helloo


I love to see you walk into the room
Body shining light in up the place
And when you talk everybody stop
Cause they know you know just what you're sayin'
The way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you roll you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

Don't fly me away
You don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know

You had me at hello (hello)
Hello (hello)
Hello (hello)
You had me at hello (hello)
Hello (hello)
Hello (hello)
It was many years ago (ago)
Baby, when you (when you)
Stole my cool (stole my cool)
Cuz you had me at hello (hello)
Hello (hello)
Hello oooooh

I get so excited when you travel with me, baby, while I'm on my grind
And never will I ever let my hustle come between me and my family time and
You keep me humble out of this hype
Cuz you know there's more to life
And if I need ya, you will be here, you will make the sacrifice

Gotta feel you
And be near you
You're the air that I breathe to survive
Gotta hold you
Want to show you
That without you my Sun doesn't shine
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you
Boy without you my life just ain't the same
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you

You had me at hello (hello)
Hello (hello)
Hello (hello)
You had me at hello (hello)
Hello (hello)
Hello (hello)
It was many years ago (ago)
When you (when you)
Stole my cool (stole my cool)
Babe, you had me at hello (hello)
Hello (hello)
Hello oooooh

It was many years ago
Baby, when you stole my cool
You had me at hello
Hello
Hello ooh
Hello hello hello
Hello hello hello
Hello hello hello

Hello
Helloo
Hello
