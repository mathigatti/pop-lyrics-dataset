Listen
I woke up this morning
And heard the TV saying something
About disaster in the world
It made me wonder where I'm going
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you girl
And what you give me lets me know that I'll be alright


Cause if your love was all I had in this life
Well that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
Cause I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time

You got me singing.
Ohhhhhhh...yeah
Ohhhhhhh...yeah
Everybody sing
Ohhhhhhh...yeah
Ohhhhhhh...yeah

Now if your ever wondering about the way I'm feeling
Baby girl there ain't no question
Just be around you is a blessin'
Seconds I've been trying to save the world
I just wanna spend my time with you girl
And what you give lets me know that I'll be alright

Cause if your love was all I had in this life
Well that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
Cause I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time

Girl you got me singing
Ohhhhhhh...yeah
Ohhhhhhh...yeah
Everybody sing
Ohhhhhhh...yeah
