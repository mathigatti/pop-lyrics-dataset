Goddamn
I, I woke, woke, I woke up like
(I woke up, I woke up, woke up with the crown)
(Candy on the ground)
(Woke, woke up with the crown)

Dum-da-de-da (Right, right)
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, ah

It's that Yoncé, that Yoncé
In that lingerie and that chardonnay
Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever, like Bun B
And I'm Rambo-ing these hoes
I'm really rit' like Donjae
I'm camo-ing these hoes
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy, you know I look good as fuck
Wish I was your baby mama
You can come around and give me good karma
But no, we escalating, up in this bitch, like elevators
Course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on the elevator

Mama taught me good home training
Daddy taught me gotta love my haters
Sister taught me how to speak my mind
My man make me feel so God damn fine
I'm flawless
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on the...

You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Ridin' 'round in it (Flawless), flossin' on that (Flawless)
These diamonds (Flawless), my diamonds (Flawless)
This rock (Flawless), my Roc (Flawless), sing
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, twins, tell 'em
Say: I look so good tonight (Hey)
Goddamn, goddamn
Say: I look so good tonight
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn

How y'all feeling?
Coachella, how did you wake up this morning?
Ha, woke up and niggas lookin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me
Alright, I want y'all to repeat after me
I'm feelin' myself, sing it

I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
(I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my)
I'm feelin' my, feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
(I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my)
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
I'm feelin' my, feeling my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself

Changed the game with that digital drop
Know where you are when that digital pop
I stop the world
Male or female, it make no difference
I stop the world, world, stop
