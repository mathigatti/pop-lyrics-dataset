You be sayin'
No no no no no
When it's really
Yes yes yes yes yes
(x 4)


Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Why don't you say what's on your mind
'Cause each and everytime
You're near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you "What's the deal?"
You're holdin' it all inside
If you wanna' be with me
You gotta' keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come get my love
All here for you

Everytime I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Bug a boo(talk)
You buggin' what?
You buggin' Who?
You buggin' me
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop

Can you pay my bills
Can you pay my telephone bills
Can you pay my automo-bills
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name!

Any other day I would call
You would say, baby how's your day?
But today it ain't the same
Every other word is
Uh huh, yeah okay,
Could it be that you,
Are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there first of all
Let me say, I am not the one
To sit around and be played
Why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin' caught up in your'one game
When you can not say my name

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be a reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name!
(all my DC's fans!)
(yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)

Ladies leave yo man at home(3x)
Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Bounce baby, bounce, bo-bounce bounce, bo-bounce
Twirk it, twirk it
Shake baby, shake sha-shake shake
Work it, work it
Twist baby, twist tw-twist
You better dip that thing

Lucy Liu
With my girl, Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
Charlie's Angels, Come on
Uh Uh Uh

Question: Tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh and I pay my own bills
Always 50/50 in relationships

The shoes on my feet
I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing
I bought it
The rock I'm rockin'
I bought it
'Cause I depend on me
If I want it
The watch I'm wearin'
I bought it
The house I live in
I bought it
The car I'm driving
I bought it
cause I depend on me
(I depend on me)

All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonc√©, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this! (WHOO!)

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this!

Now that you're out of my life
I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you
Sold 9 million

I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon give up
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'

I'm a survivor!!
