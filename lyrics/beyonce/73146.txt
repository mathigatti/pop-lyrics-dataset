Here I am
Looking in the mirror
An open face, the pain erased
Now the sky is clearer
I can see the sun
Now that all is, all is said and done, oh


There you are
Always strong when I need you
You let me give
And now I live, fearless and protected
With the one I will love
After all is, all is said and done

I once believed that hearts were made to bleed
(Inside I once believed that hearts were made to bleed, ohbaby)
But now I'm not afraid to say

I need you, I need you so stay with me

These precious (precious) hours (yeah)
Greet each dawn in open arms
And dream, into tomorrow

Where there's only love
After all is, all is said and done

(Yeah baby) Oh baby
(Inside I once believed, that hearts were meant to bleed)

(I'll never)
I'll never be afraid to say
I need you, I need you, so here

Here we are in the still of this moment
Fear is gone, hope lives on

We found our happy ending
For there's only love (only love)
And this sweet, sweet love
After all is, all is said and done

Yeah baby after all is (all is)

All is said and done
