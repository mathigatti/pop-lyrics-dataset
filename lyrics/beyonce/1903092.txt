You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu


I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight
I'll do it every way
Speakers knockin' til the morning light

'Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party

Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Tuck down with the radio on
And the night belong to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go

So in love
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they talking tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, uh, uh, uh ooh
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light

Set the scene, three thousand degrees
Ain't worried 'bout them f-ck niggas over there
But they worried 'bout me
I got a homeboy named Butta and another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese
Fuck wit' me baby
I make it milk 'til it drip down yo' knees
Spit this shit fo' rillo, brain brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court, eating our gyro
Yesterday, that's the way, every single mornin' I try to pray
Grandmom 'n them, they never forgot
And nothin' else really mean nuttin' to me
I ain't stuntin' to beat, talkin' to me?
Girl, why you f-ckin' wit' me?
Move on, ain't nuttin' to see
Pssh, always somethin' to salt, I'm the raw, off the rip
'Cause of him, all of them, will remem, ber the men
And that they fell in love with rap, black like havin' your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due
Cream like when I'm lovin' you
Yeah

So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light

'Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party

You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu
