(I wake up looking this good
And I wouldn't change it if I could
(If I could, if I, if I, could)
And you can say what you want
I'm the shit (what you want I'm the shit)
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit
I want everyone to feel like this, tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn)
(Say I look so good tonight
God damn, God damn
Say I look so good tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn)


It stay Yoncé, your Yoncé in that lingerie
On that chardonnay, scorin' touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever like Bun B, and I'm redboned yo
I'm really rit like Donjae, I'm camo in here yo
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy you know I look good as fuck
You wish I was your babymomma
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no
We escalate, up in this bitch like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
(Ha, ha, God damn, God damn, God damn)

You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say I look so good tonight
God damn, God damn
Say I look so good tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn

I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myI'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myI'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Changed the game with that Lemonade drop
Know where you was when that Lemonade popped
I stopped the world
Male or female, it make no difference
I stop the world, world stop
Carry on
