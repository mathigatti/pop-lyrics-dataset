[Beyoncé]
Ooooooh I love you, I love you So
Ooooooh I love you, I love you So
And I love you
You'd take the clothes off my back, and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it, I still don't know why
Why I love you so much, oh
You curse my name
In spite, to put me to shame
Air all my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why (don't know why)
Why I love it so much, yeah


And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from the cup 'till it runneth over, Holy Grail

[Jay-Z]
Uh, Blue told me to remind you niggas
Uh, fuck that shit y’all talkin' about, I'm the nigga
Uh, caught up in all these lights and cameras
Uh, but look what that shit did to Hammer
Uh, goddammit I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
'Nough to make me wanna murder, Momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself uh

[Jay-Z &amp; Justin Timberlake]
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid, and contagious
Know we all just entertainers

[Beyoncé]
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from the cup 'till it runneth over, Holy Grail

[Jay-Z]
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See them by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high, sittin' low
Sliding by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain works
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with it, this shit ain't work, this light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours, why you mad take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with that bath water you're still alive
Still that nigga nigga, you survived
You still getting bigger nigga living the life
Vanilla wafers in a villa, illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson thriller

[Beyoncé]
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack the code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'till it runneth over, Holy Grail
Oooooh
Don't know why

Why I love you, why I love you, why I love you
Holy Grail
