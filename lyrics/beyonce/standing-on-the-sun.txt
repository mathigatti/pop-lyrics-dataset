Your body turn up, me say: Turn up, turn up
Gyal you hot like the sun, so you turn up, turn up
Your body turn up, me say: Turn up, turn up
Gyal you hot like the sun, so you turn up, Beyonce
Ya wind fi me!
Ya wind fi me!


My body is magnified
In the sun, set me alight
My body and your delights
Burn me up, set me alight

I can't deny your desire
Feel like I'm on fire
When, you touch me
I feel the flame lickin' at my feet

Can you feel the heat on my skin?
Can you feel, all my lovin'?
You and me
We're standin' on the sun
Can you feel my heart burnin'?
Can you feel all my good lovin'?
You and me
We're standin' on the sun
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun

Let's get to huggin' and kissin'
Don't know the floor from the ceilin'
We cooked it up in the kitchen
Nobody hotter than you
You know that I'm twerkin'
And give you somethin' that's worth it
But d-d-daddy that's perfect
This 'yonc√© only for you
All that ocean, can't you see it?
Mix up passion with fruit, sangria
BB Cubana, Ai que lindo
Ya tu sabes camino como cocino, primo
There's only one thing on my mind
I wanna love you long time
Want you to watch me while I wind
Want you to love me long time
We're just havin' such a good time
Over and over we find
With the flame lickin' at my feet
Kiss you while the sun kisses me

Can you feel the heat on my skin?
Can you feel, all my lovin'?
You and me
We're standin' on the sun
Can you feel my heart burnin'?
Can you feel all my good lovin'?
You and me
We're standin' on the sun
(Feel everything
Standin' on the sun)
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun
