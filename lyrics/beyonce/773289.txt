Hehehe! Yeah, B!
Talk yo' shit! Hehe (partner, let me upgrade you)
How you gon' upgrade me?
What's higher than number one?
You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block (partner, let me upgrade you)


[Beyoncé]
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

[Beyoncé]
You need a real woman in your life (that's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (that's a good look)
I'mma help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies that's a good look)
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (that's a good look)
It take me just to compliment the deals (that's a good look)
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies that's a good look)

[Beyoncé]
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you, I can up, can I upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you
Flip a new page, let me upgrade you
Introduce you to some new things, and upgrade you
I can up, can I up, let me upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you

[Beyoncé]
I can do for you, what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals
Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help, whenever you need me (you need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

[Beyoncé]
You need a real woman in your life (that's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (that's a good look)
I can help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies, that's a good look)
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (that's a good look)
It take me just to compliment the deals (that's a good look)
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies, that's a good look)

[Beyoncé &amp; JAY-Z]
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) grade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you
Flip a new page, let me upgrade you
Introduce you to some new things, and (uh!) upgrade (HOV!) you
I can (up), (uh!) can I (up), let me, (HOV!) upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you,(Uh huh huh!)

[JAY-Z]
I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (hehe)

[Beyoncé]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, car notes, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Make you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) grade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you
Flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things, and upgrade you
I can (up), can I (up), let me, upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you

Audemars Piguet watch, dimples in ya necktie
Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers, diamond cream facials
VVS cuff links, six-star pent suites
Partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, partna, let me upgrade ya (huh!)
