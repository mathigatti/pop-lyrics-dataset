I’ve been drinking, I’ve been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I’ve been thinking, I’ve been thinking
Why can’t I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na-nah
Why can’t I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na-nah


Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal
With these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na-nah
Can’t keep your eyes off of my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na-nah
Drunk in love
I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in the club
Drunk in love

We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

We be all night
And everything all right
No complaints from my body
So florescent under these lights
Boy, I’m drinking
Park it in my lot 7-11
I’m rubbing on it, ru-rubbing it
If you scared call that reverend
Boy, I’m drinking

Get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louie sheets he sweat it out
Like wash rags he wear it out
Boy, I’m drinking
I’m singing on the mic ’til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up half way
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood
Graining, graining on that wood
I’m swerving on that, swerving
Swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve
Surfing all of this good, good

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in the club
Drunk in love

We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

I’m nice right now
Hold up
That D’ussé is the shit
If I do say so myself
If I do say so myself
If I do say so myself
Hold up
Stumbled all in the house
Time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talking ’bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking ’bout you be repping that Third
I wanna see all the shit that I heard
You know I sling Clint Eastwood
I hope that you can handle this curve, uh!
Foreplay in the foyer
Fucked up my Warhlol
Slip the panties right to the side
Ain’t got the time to take draws off
On site
Catch a charge I might
Beat the box up like Mike in ’97, I’ll bite
I’m Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby, no, I don’t play
Now eat the cake, Anna Mae
I said eat the cake, Anna Mae
I’m nice
For ya’ll to reach these heights
You gonna need G3
4, 5, 6 flights sleep tight
We sex again in that morning
Your breastases is my breakfast
We going in

We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

Never tired, never tired
I’ve been sipping it’s the only thing
That’s been keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn’t mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I’ve been drinking watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy
I want you right now
Can’t keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
