All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So young and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on 'cuz I realized I've got


Me, myself and I, that's all I've got
In the end that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry I took a vow
That from now on I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself and I, that's all I've got
In the end that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry I took a vow
That from now on I'm gonna be my own best friend

So controlling, you said that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong because I realized I've got

Me, myself and I, that's all I've got
In the end that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry I took a vow
That from now on I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself and I, that's all I've got
In the end that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry I took a vow
That from now on I'm gonna be my own best friend

(I've got me, myself and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it now
(I can't regret all the times spent with you)
Ya, you hurt me, nut I learned a lot along the way
(After all the rain, you'll see the sun)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(I've got me, myself and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it now
(I can't regret all the times spent with you)
Ya, you hurt me, nut I learned a lot along the way
(After all the rain, you'll see the sun)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again

(I've got me, myself and I)
Me, myself and I
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I have cried so many times
(I can't regret all the times spent with you)
I can't regret all the times spent with you
(After all the rain, you'll see the sun)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(I've got me, myself and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it now
(I can't regret all the times spent with you)
Ya, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
