Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight


I was out shopping thinking of something I should get you
'Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face
And let you know I'm happy you're my best friend

Part of this watchin', boy, I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today
For my babe

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'm'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Oh, boy, if you just call, I'm on my way
When it comes to my baby, I bring my best
It's just you and me all night
Don't worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Don't worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Let's pop a bottle of the vintage that I bought you
I model sexy pictures right on top of you
Ten years together, still feels like we're making love for the first time
Like I'm in high-school sneaking with my boyfriend

Part of this watchin', boy, I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today
For my babe

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
Boy, I'm'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Boy, if you just call, I'm on my way
When it comes to my baby, I bring my best
I just wanna party tonight
'Cause it's obvious to see
That you're where I wanna be, oh

Just let me look at you
Ooh you look so sexy, boy, I want a taste
You already know which way
When I groove with you
Ooh, you feel so good, boy, you're my favorite place
Just come and lay under me

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
I'm'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
Boy, I'm'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
