To be or not to be? Not!
Hold up! Bring the beat back
Stop! I ain’t ready yet
Wait! Let me fix my hair (yes, yes!)
Yes, ma'am (yes, ma'am!)
Now pass me my dress (yes, yes!)


I think I’m ready
Been locked up in the house way too long
It’s time to get it
'Cause once again he’s out doing wrong
And my girls are so real
Said it’s been a minute since I had some
He’s been actin' up
But he won’t be the only one

'Cause when they act wrong
That’s when you put it on
Get 'em uptight
This is your song
Poke out your back
Time to impress
Pull out your freakum dress

Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, every woman got one
Oh, shut it down when the time comes
Oh, so pull out the big guns
Oh, and put your freakum dress on

Soon as he saw me
Turned on by how the dress was fittin' right
Short and backless
See my silhouette in the moonlight
Such an attraction
Keep tellin' me how my outfit’s so nice
Little did he know
Ha, my man gon' take it off tonight

'Cause when they act wrong
That’s when you put it on
Get 'em uptight
This is your song
Poke out your back
Time to impress
Pull out your freakum dress

Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, every woman got one
Oh, shut it down when the time comes
Oh, so pull out the big guns
Oh, and put your freakum dress on

All the ladies, you ain't get 
All dressed up in your dresses
And your best digs with no reason
Get ready to freakum, freakum

When you put it on, it’s an invitation
When they play your song, get on up and shake it
Pokin' out your back, you don’t have to waste it
Spin it all around then take it to the ground and

When you put it on, it’s an invitation
When they play your  song, get on up and shake it
Work it out your back, you don’t have to waste it
Spin it all around then take it to the ground and

'Cause when they act wrong
That’s when you put it on
Get 'em uptight
This is your song
Poke out your back
Time to impress
Pull out your freakum dress

Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, every woman got one
Oh, shut it down when the time comes
Oh, so pull out the big guns
Oh, and put your freakum dress on

Ladies, look it here
When you been with your man for a long time
Every now and then, you gotta go in the back of that closet
And pull out that freakum dress, ha

I got my freakum dress on
I got my freakum dress on, whoa
I got my freakum dress on
I got my freakum dress on, whoa
