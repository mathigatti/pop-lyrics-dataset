Dim the lights down low
Take your time with me
But I don't need deep ohh slow
Lay back and let your hands find every secret spot of mine
Calling me
Let the candles blow while im rocking your body from head to toe
You can watch my silhouette flow
On the wall it can be your private picture show


Body rock put it all on me
Body rock spread it all over
Body rock rock rock give it all to me
Body rock baby bring it home
Body rock put it all on me
Body rock don't hold back on me boy
Body rock rock rock don't leave me hungry
Body rock baby bring it home

Baby hold me close
Cause i wanna feel your every move for sure
The experience back to back, back to back, back to back
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 til I can't take no more
6, then we move to the floor
7, 8, 9, 10, ohhh

Body rock put it all on me
Body rock spread it all over
Body rock rock rock give it all to me
Body rock baby bring it home
Body rock put it all on me
Body rock don't hold back on me boy
Body rock rock rock don't leave me hungry
Body rock baby bring it home
