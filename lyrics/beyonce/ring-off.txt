Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare


And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"
Until you had enough, then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying

Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man, now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)

You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish this didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

Until you had enough, then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, crying, fighting
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man, now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

After all your tears
After all, that pain's all clear, mama
After all them years
We can start all over again, mama
And now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end, mama
We can love again
This is where freedom begins, mama

So put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody, put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl, you so fine, put your love on top

"If you're going through it just know it's called 'going through it'
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive"
