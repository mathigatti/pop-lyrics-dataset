We be all night

Woo! You will never need another lover
Woo! Cause you a milf and I'm a motherfucker
Told you give the drummer some, now the drummer cummin'
I'm pa rum pa pum pumin' all on your stomach

Yeah, tonight I see some super freaky hoes
That could go from bein' stripper to a super C.E.O
I don't know the way you do it, but you do it to me though
And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show

Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else
But far as handlin' all that ass
I think you gon' need some help
Let me remind you, you got a
You got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do

I ain't no pastor, don't do missionary
I know good pussy when I see it, I'm a visionary
I know them haters talkin', always had us very wary
Yup! On the 35th of Nevuary
Yup! You love the way I'm turnt
After all the money you earned
Still show daddy what you learned

That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse, you reverse
And I impregnated your mouth, girl, ooh
That's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl
We fuckin' all over the house, girl
We just messed up a brand new couch, girl
You ain't on site then you on Skype
I put you on that bike, you bound, girl

We too wild, won't turn down
We drunk in love, fuck them
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor gets into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras
All in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
How in hell did this shit happen?
Oh baby, drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, walking in my l'assemblage
I'm grubbing on the rope
Grubbing if you scared
Call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
I'm on the Cognac, gangster wife
New sheets, he'd swear that I like washed rags
He wet up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm sinking on the mic
Til my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving
Swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerv, surfing all of this good, good

We woke up in the kitchen saying
How in hell did this shit happen?
Oh baby, drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

Jay Z
Hold up
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Tryna backup all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that 3rd
Wanna see all that shit I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Annie Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Annie Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
We gon' need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

Never tired, never tired
I been sippin
That's the only thing keeping me on fire, me on fire
To me it's feeling like all of my entire life
I've been drinking
Boy, I'm Marilyn
I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now
C-can't keep ya eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
