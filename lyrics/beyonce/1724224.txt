(Intro)
Oh no she didn't
Oh yes she did
Hey, hey, hey


(Chorus)
We about to catch a case
About to catch a case
We about to catch a case
About to catch a case
I'm about to catch a case
Hey, hey, hey, hey

(Verse 1)
Excuse me
That's the second time you bumped into me
Excuse, huh, whatcha say
One of ya'll better get her
Cuz I don't wanna get up in it
You just called me a gold digger
Now I gotta get up in her
Hold my
Somebody get my bag
Hold my
I need a stick up my hair
Three seconds
I'm 'bout to lose control
Call the cops
Cuz I'm 'bout to let go

(Hook)
Where my hardcore ladies from the front to back
And if you ready for war, where the ump you at
Where my soul sistas at
Where my soul sistas at
Where my soul sistas at
Don't hold me back

(Chorus)
We about to catch a case
About to catch a case
We about to catch a case
About to catch a case
I'm about to catch a case
Hey, hey, hey, hey
We about to catch a case
About to catch a case
We about to catch a case
About to catch a case
I'm about to catch a case
What
Hey, hey, hey, hey

(Verse 2)
Usually I keep my cool and keep it movin'
But you know just what you're doin'
Arm is swinging, now get through it
We can do it
You wanna prove it
Then go 'head and make yo move
Unless you're scared
Cuz if you're scared I can understand
You might be showin' off
Tell me is it for your man
You brought him to the cause
Maybe that's how you can get down
And if you don't then you can pray

(Hook)
Where my hardcore ladies from the front to back
And if you ready for war, where the ump you at
Where my soul sistas at
Where my soul sistas at
Where my soul sistas at
Don't hold me back

(Chorus 2x)
We about to catch a case
About to catch a case
We about to catch a case
About to catch a case
I'm about to catch a case
Hey, hey, hey
We about to catch a case
About to catch a case
We about to catch a case
About to catch a case
I'm about to catch a case
What
Hey, hey, hey, hey

(Hook)
Where my hardcore ladies from the front to back
And if you ready for war, where the ump you at
Where my soul sistas at
Where my soul sistas at
Where my soul sistas at
Don't hold me back
