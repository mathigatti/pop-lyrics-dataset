Bring the beat in!

Honey, honey
I can see the stars
All the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun
Whenever you're near
Every time you touch me
I just melt away

Now everybody asks me
Why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
But I know
Ooooh
Nothing's perfect
But it's worth it
After fighting through my fears
And finally you put me first

Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see.
Come on baby it's you

You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top

Ooo!
Come on baby.
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooo ooo!
Come on baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top

Bring the beat in!

Oooh

You put my love on top

Baby, baby
I can feel the wind
Whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again and again

Now everybody asks me
Why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
But I know
Oooh
Nothing's perfect
But it's worth it
After fighting through my fears
And finally you put me first

Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top

Ooo! Baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
