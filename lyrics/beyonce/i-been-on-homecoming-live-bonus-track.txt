I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?
'Cause I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?


Rollin' high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what's good
Kiss my mama, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your boo was talkin' lip
I told my crew to smack that trick
Smack that trick, smack that trick
Guess what they did, smacked that trick
Gold everything, gold ass chain
Gold ass rings, gold ass fangs
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the number one chick, I don't need no hype
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life

I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?
'Cause I been on

I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids
Frenchy's, Boudin in the parking lot
Shout out to Willie D
I was in that Willie D video when I was about fourteen, lookin' crazy
Shout out to Pimp C
You know, we used to sneak and listen to that UGK
Didn'tâ€“ your girl but your sister was alright, man
Ah-ah in ya homeboy's Caddy last night, man, hahahahaha
Hol' up, Texas trill
H-Town goin' down, man
