I feel weak
We've been here before
'Cause I feel we
Keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over
Maybe we're through
But I honestly can say
I still love you


Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over
And give love another life

I can see
That we're not happy here
So why would we
Keep pretending when there's nothing there?
Maybe you like it
Well, I don't
Maybe you'll settle
Well, I won't

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over
And give love another life

I know that this will hurt you
I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish
But that's a lie
I feel I know what's the best for us

Let's start over!
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over
I'm tired of fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We both know that this love won't die
Maybe we can start all over
And give love another life
