I always loved you 
Even though 
Did me wrong 
I always stayed 
By your side 
I guess 
I was your fool 
I always cared 
There's no one 
Above you 
I swear 
Cheated on me now 
She's there 


She won't answer 
Your calls 
Don't wanna be 
Bothered at all 
I guess 
I'll be the one 
Standing 
With open arms 
Sucka for love 
Kisses too 
Ya touch 
I'm crazy for you 

Chorus:
I'll settle for you 
Yes 
I will be 
The one who will 
Settle for you 
Yes 
I will be 
The one you run to 
You come running to 
Yes 
I will be 
The one who will 
Settle for you 
Settle for you 

I can never 
Leave you 
No matter how 
Hard I try 
You'll probably 
Do it again 
I'll still be 
Right here waiting 
Nothing has changed 
It remains 
The same 
I can't explain 

Sucka for love 
Ya kisses too 
Ya touch 
I'm crazy for you 

(Chorus) 

Even
When the chips 
Are down 
I'll still 
Settle for you 
You'll probably 
Hurt me again 
I'll still 
Settle for you 
I know I must be 
The world's 
Greatest fool 

I'll still 
Settle for you 

(Chorus) 

I will always 
Love you 
No matter how 
Hard I try 
Probably 
Do it again 
I'll still be 
Here waiting 
Stuck with you 
In love with you 
Here for you 
Loving you 
Settling for you 
Baby, yea
