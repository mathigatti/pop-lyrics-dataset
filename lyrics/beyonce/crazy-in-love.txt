I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave i'm begging you not to go
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave i'm begging you not to go
Call you name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How i'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Yeah
Cause i know i don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Yes! It's so crazy right now!
Most incredibly, it's your girl, B
It's history in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress

It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love your doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)

I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly

Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly

Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

I love to love you baby

I'm feeling sexy
I wanna hear you say my name, boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame
I'm feelin kind of n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me

Baby the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe has just taken over me
Start feeling so crazy babe
Lately I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feeling so crazy babe

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
