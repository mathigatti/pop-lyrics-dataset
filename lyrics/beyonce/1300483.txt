My man was one of those neat freaks. Everything just had to be sparkless: the floors, his shirts, even the silverware. One day I was sick and tired of being the maid. So, that night, i ran his bath water extra watts. Then I accidentally dropped his radio onto the water! I finally put the sparkle back into our relationship. At least he died clean !ha ha ha

We were high school sweethearts. We went to prom together, graduated together and we even went to college together. He was my first everything. I just knew he'd be my husband. Until one day I got an invite to his wedding in e-mail. Damn right, I showed up, I wanted to congratulate him personally. After all, it does said "'till death do us apart", all right ?

We met in my salsa dance class. His moves were so intoxicating. Let's just say.. we danced on the dance-floor, in the bedroom, the kitchen, my BMW, AI PAPI ! Until one day, he decided to switch from salsa to ballet. And I caught him in first position with my best friend, Carlos. Now they both can tango for eternity!

I've always been and independent woman (question !). But I knew he was broke when I met him. But I didn't mind, though, 'cause he always put it down. I took him everywhere, India, Brazil, Milan, you name it. But little did I know, he was picking up a souvenir in every city. So when I caught him with that extra souvenir, i stabbed his passport to his final destination: to hell !
