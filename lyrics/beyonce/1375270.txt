Trust in me
In all you do
Have the faith
I have in you
Love will see
Us through
If only you
Trust in me
Why don't you
Trust me?
Come to me
When things
Go wrong


Cling to me daddy
And I'll be
Strong
We can get along
We can get along
If only you
Trust in me
While there's
A moon
A moon on high
While there
Are birds
Birds to fly

While
There is you
You and I
I can be sure
That I love you
Stand beside me
Stand beside me
All the while
Come on daddy
Face the future
Why don't you
Smile?
Trust in me
And I'll be
Worthy of you
Why don't you
Trust in me
In all you do?
Have the faith
That I have
In you

And love
Will see
Us through
If only you
Trust in me
Why don't you
Come to me
When things
Go wrong
Cling to me
And I'll be
Strong
We can get along
We can get along
If only you
Trust in me
