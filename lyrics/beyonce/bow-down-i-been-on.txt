I'm out that H-Town coming, coming down
I'm coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground
H-H-Town-Town I'm coming down, co-co-coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground


I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches

I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit
Bow down bitches

Bow down bitches
Bow, bow down bitches
Bow down bitches
Bow, bow down bitches

H-Town vicious, H-H-Town vicious
I'm so crown, bow, bow down bitches

I'm out that H-Town coming, coming down
I'm coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground
H-H-Town-Town I'm coming down, co-co-coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground

I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off, take me off
Take me off, take me off
Cuz I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off, take me off
Take me off, take me off

Rolling high, leather and Louis
Keep it trill that's what's good
Kiss my momma show that love
Pop them bottles in that club

I heard your boo was talking lip
I told my crew to smack that trick
Smack that trick, smack that trick
Guess what they did?
Smacked that trick

Gold everything
Gold ass chain
Gold ass rings
Gold ass fangs
You can see me stunt
When you turn on your screen
You can see me stunt
When you turn on your screen

I'm bigger than life
My name in the lights
I'm the number one chick
I don't need no hype
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life

I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off, take me off
Take me off, take me off
Cuz I been on

I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids
Frenchy's, Boudin in the parking lot

Shout out to Willie D
I was in that Willie D. Video when I was about fourteen
Looking crazy

Shout out to Pimp C
You know we used to sneak and listen to that UGK
Didn't fuck yo girl but
Your sister was alright, man
I hopped up in your homeboy's caddy last night, man
Hold up
Texas trill
H-Town going down, man
