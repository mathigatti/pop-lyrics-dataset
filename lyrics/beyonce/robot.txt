I've been having a hard time sleeping
It's 7 am
And I've been up for about two hours.
I landed and did a show
And I had three shows in a row
And then in my day off
I had to go into the studio.


Yesterday was another show,
As soon as I got off of the stage
I had to get on a train,
I didn't get in until one in the morning.

Then I have another show,
And another show.
It's gonna be like almost nine days
Without resting my voice
And my body and my mind.

I'm just really upset that
I don't have
Anyone that's concerned about
My body and my wellbeing.
