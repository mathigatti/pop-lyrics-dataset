Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut I find myself in love racing the earth


And I soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

I wanna run (run) smash into you
I wanna run (run) smash into you

Ears closed
What I hear no one else has to know
'Cause I know that what we have
Is worth first place and gold

And I soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

I wanna run (run) smash into you
I wanna run (run) smash into you

Head down
As I watch my feet take turns
Hitting the ground
I should
I'm in love and I'm racing the earth

And I soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

I wanna run smash into you
I'm willing to run (run) smash into you

I'm willing to run run run run ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm willing to run run run run ooh ooh ooh ooh

I wanna run and smash into you
I'm willing to run (run) smash into you
