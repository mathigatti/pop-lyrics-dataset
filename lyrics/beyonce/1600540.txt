Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes
I'm goin' outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby


You can be a sweet dream (or a beautiful nightmare)
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love is too good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin' no where
Baby long as you're here
I'll be floating on air cause you're my
(You can be a sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Wake up from you, you

Tattoo your name across my heart
(Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can make us part (ohh, ohh)
(Not even death can make us part)
Tattoo your name across my heart (ohh, ohhhh)
(Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can make us part
What kind of dream is this?

I love you (3x)
Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrop
I am the seed
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud
Proud to be your girl
You make the confusion
Go all away
From this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love and to hold
To feel
To breathe
To live you, you, you ,you, you
Dangerously In Love
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing (I can't do this thing without you here with me)
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you (hold me)
I'll never leave (kiss me)
Just keep lovin' me (love me)
The way I love you loving me
Dangerously (2x)
I love you (9x)

With all my heart I love you, baby
Stay with me and you will see
My arms will hold you, baby
Never leave, 'cause I believe
In this love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name, I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way
No stronger love in this world
Oh baby no, you're my man, I'm your girl
I'll never go, wait and see, can't be wrong
Don't you know this where you belong
I'm in love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name, I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way
â€¦
Just love me sweetly baby,
Just do love me sweetly baby, eh eh
Don't, nobody will know, uh uh
Baby I, I'm in love with you
I can't do this thing
Called life without you
Dangerously in love
