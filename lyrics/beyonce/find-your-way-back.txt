Daddy used to take me walking down the street
Daddy used to take my hand, say: Follow me
Daddy used to leave me back home all the time
I got big enough to run around, daddy left me outside


He said: Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home with the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back

Daddy used to tell me: Look up at the stars
It's been a long time, but remember who you are
Circle of life, but one day I might not make it
Circle of life, but one day I might not make it

But you just got to find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home with the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back

Daddy used to teach me all my moves
Run around wild, had to tie my shoes
Itty bitty child with a smile like you
Wild, wild child, look a lot like you
Daddy used to teach me all my tricks
Run around wild, had to get my fix
Daddy used to teach me all my prayers
On a marathon, had to run my race

Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home with the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back, yeah

Daddy used to teach me all my moves
Run around wild, had to tie my shoes
Itty bitty child with a smile like you
Wild, wild child, look a lot like you
Daddy used to teach me all my tricks
Run around wild, had to get my fix
Daddy used to teach me all my prayers
On a marathon, told me run my race

Find your way back
