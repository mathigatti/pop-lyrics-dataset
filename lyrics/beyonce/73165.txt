The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got (tell me more)
Your love has captured me


Over and over again
I tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
But all the while, inside , I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

Lyin' here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more (more and more)
Let's give love a try

Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts of love will find
True love in a special way

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me

Ohh, over and over again
I tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
But all the while, inside , I knew it was real
The way you make me feel


My baby, my baby, my baby, my love

Come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love
I wanna see into those eyes of love come closer
Just a little a closer let me speak to you
I wanna softly tell you something
Here I am heres my love, I just want you to come closer
Come a little closer, let me whisper in your ear
'cause I wanna tell you something
I wanna whisper in your ear, so soft, so come closer and
Move a little closer we can say for real
The way we feel about each other's lovin'
