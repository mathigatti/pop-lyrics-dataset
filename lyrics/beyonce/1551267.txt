I gotta give up
To quite the storm that rages inside
The way that I hit my damage part
You gave me away


And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strange to follow it trough
I'm ready to change

I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We're only find ourselves by loosing all
Control (x11)

I'm hoping enough
Shiny sunlight can releave
It's crazy he knows shone flow trough me
I'm gonna explode

You take me away
And what is my ordinary life
I won't be afraid of what we might find
A love I can't go

I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul

So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, We can pretend
We're only find ourselves by loosing all
Control

And you horizing ready to play
with every breath you take it away
Hey, hey, hey!

I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We're only ... by loosing all
Control (x8)
