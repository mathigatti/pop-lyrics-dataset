If I were a boy, even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it,
Cause they stick up for me


If I were a boy!
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone,
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone,
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home,
To come home, to come home, to come home!

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong...

I want you to know
That I'm happy for you
And I want nothing but
The best for you both

An older version of me
Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
But it was a slap in the face
How quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?

'Cause the love that you gave, that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough
For you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died? 'Til you died?
But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

But you're just a boy
Baby you don't understand
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you're taking her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy...
