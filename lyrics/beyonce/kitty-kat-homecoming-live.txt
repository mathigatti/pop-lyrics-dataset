I rock diamonds on my neck
Got diamonds on my records
Since 15, comin' down, reppin' Texas
How you gon' neglect this? You was just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain't gots to lie, Craig
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm nobody
You gon' make me call somebody


(Let's go, little kitty cat)
I think it's time to go
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
He don't want no mo'
(Let's go little kitty cat)
He better call Becky with the good hair
