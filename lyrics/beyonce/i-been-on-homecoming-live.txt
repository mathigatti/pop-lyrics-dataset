C-c-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
C-c-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
C-c-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
C-c-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
Listen


I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I-I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

Rolling high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what good
Kiss my mama, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your crew was talking lip
Guess what I did? Smack that trick
Smack that trick
Guess what I did? (Smack that trick)
Gold everything, gold ass fangs
Gold ass chains, gold ass things
You can see me stunt when you turn on the screen
You can-you can see me stunt when you turn on the screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the capital B, I don't need no hype
The capital B mean I'm 'bout that life
The capital B mean I'm 'bout that life, bitch
