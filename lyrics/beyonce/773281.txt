To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, mmm


To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it, please, don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for one second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for one second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be your nothing?
Nothing at all to you
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, mmm
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for one second get to thinking, baby

You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
Nigga, pack all your bags, we're finished
(You must not know about me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know about me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for one second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
