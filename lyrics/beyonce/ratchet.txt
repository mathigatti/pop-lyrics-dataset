World once seemed still, till you came around
Bringing all my emotions unbound
You unlocked my soul and rocked my Universe
Whoa, ohhh-o-o-ohh


You are some kind of a dream
Some kind of wild imagination machine
Take me, ratchet me around
Open my heart
Speak our truth
Together we unwind like a corkscrew
I love you
