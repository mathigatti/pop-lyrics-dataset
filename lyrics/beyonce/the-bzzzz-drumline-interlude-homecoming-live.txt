[Slater Thorpe]
We got snares, cymbals, quads, and base
It's time for you to get a little taste
Of the only drumline certified by the Queen Bee
Guaranteed to show up and show out on your ass
Any time, any place, anywhere
Introducing the Buzz


Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo

We ready, we ready
We ready, we ready
We ready, we ready
We ready

Hey, Iâ€™m ready
Hey, I'm ready
Hey, I'm ready
Hey (horns)
