Now, now, now, honey
You better sit down and look around
'Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home
Me, the kids, and the dog is gone
Check my credentials
I give you everything you want, everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why


Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got class
I got style and I got ass
And you don't even care to care
Look at here
I even put money in my bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in ya books, I'm sharper
But you don't care to know I'm smart
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
I got move in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tuned

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

(Nothin' not to love about me!)
There's nothin' not to love about me
No, no, there's nothin' not to love about me
(No, no, nothin' not to love about me)
I'm lovely

There's nothin' not to need about me
(Nothin' not to need about me)
No, no, there's nothin' not to need about me
(Nothin' not to need about me)
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just playin'
Dumb!
