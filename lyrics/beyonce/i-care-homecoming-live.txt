I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
When you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care? Well, that's okay


Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby (oh)

Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry
And now every time our love goes sour, you can't sympathize, baby
You see these tears falling down to my ear
I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care? Well, that's okay
Listen, hey

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you're just givin' up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

Ooh, ooh, do-do-do do do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh, hey

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

I still care, baby
I still care, yeah
I still care
La-la-la, la-la-la
