Yea (yea, yea)
Styles I hear you man
(Usher)
This it right here
I'm the King ya'll know that
She the queen, came right back
(Yea)
Oh Remix


Now baby girl there ain't no more
That I can say
You know by now I want it more tha anythang
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody

[Beyoncé]
I know you want it
But I'm hesitating
You must be crazy
I got a man
And you got a lady

[Usher]
I know we here together
So this must be something special
You can be anywhere you wanted
But you decided to be here wit me
No coincidence it was meant to be
Don't be shy gon let yo boy get in
So you can tell all yo friends you was on the remix

In this club
In this club
Ladies can I put this love in you one time if you ain't scared say what's up
In this club
In this club
They can keep watchin I don't give a
In this club

[Beyoncé]
Baby you know I'd be down
But we can't have all these people staring standing around
This right here is only for your eyes to see
But you gettin carried away
Saying we can do it where ever
The way you touchin me like no other
(I'm gon make you feel insane)
Tryin your hardest to make me give in
But I'ma be down to give you what you wanting if you keep it up
I strongly doubt this velvet rope will hold me up
And I don't want security rollin up on us
I'm not hesitating I just don't wanna rush
You can be anywhere you wanna
But you decided to be here wit me
No coincidence it was meant to be
I'd mess it if I mess around if I let you get in
You gon tell all yo friends you was on this remix

In this club
In this club
Can I put this love in you one time if you ain't scared say what's up
In this club
In this club
They can keep watchin I'm stopping I don't give up
In this club

[Lil Wayne]
UhUh
Shawty want a thug
It started wit a hug
And the rest went like this
I gave her neck a kissy-kiss
She gave my neck a kiss back
I said we can do it like a stack
I'm mean we can do it like a G
On the couch in VIP
Shawty we can get it on
I'm a shoutout to the DJ for playin this song
Girl we can tag it like two damn fools
Have everybody thinkin we doin they dance move
Call me so I can make it juciy for you
Meet in the bathroom and you can be my secret lover
(Girl)
And it started wit a hug
But now we making love in this club
And when I come stlyin just because
The people in this crowd are watching us
Cuz we don't give a damn what they say
They say the remix baby

[Usher]
Come a little closer
Let daddy put it on ya
Need you to know what happens here stays here

[Beyoncé]
I'm ready and willing
Almost good to go
Got you standing at attention
Keep it on the low

[Usher]
Ain't nobody watching
Don't worry they can't see us
I know I got you hot
Now let me in

[Beyoncé]
You in the club or the car
Wherever you are
Run and tell the DJ run it back on replay

In this club
In this club
Can I put this love in you one time if you ain't scared say what's up
In this club
In this club
They can keep watchin I'm stopping I don't give up
In this club
