We like them boys up top from the BK (BK)
I like them boys over there, they looking strong tonight (strong tonight)
(California Love)
We like them boys that be in them lac's leanin' (leanin')
Open their mouth, they grill gleamin' (gleamin')
Candy paint, keep that whip clean and, sing it, y'all (clean and)
(They always be talkin' that country slang, we like)
They keep that beat that be in the back beating (beating)
His eyes be so low from their chiefin' (chiefin')
I love how he keep my body screaming (screaming)
A rude boy that's good to me, with street credibility

If his status ain't hood, I ain't checking for him
Better be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean

I know some soldiers in here (where they at? Where they at?)
They wanna take care of me (where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here (where they at? Where they at?)
Wouldn't mind taking one for me (where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here (where they at? Where they at?)
They wanna spend that on me, haha (where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here (where they at? Where they at?)
Wouldn't mind putting that on me, let's go (where they at?)

I need a soldier
