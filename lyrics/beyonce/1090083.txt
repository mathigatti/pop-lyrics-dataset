Hit me!!!!

CHORUS 2X:
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me a hard,make me lose my (Hah Hah)


Oooh
I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like you don't know what to do
After I done did everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast baby now I can't find you

Oooh
I'm starting to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like it can't come through
All them nights like you satisfy me
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me

CHORUS 2X:

Oooh
Two things I don't like when I'm trying get my groove
Is a partener that meets me only half way, and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard, and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction

Oooh
You understand the facts that I'm trying get to you
You moving so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference from a man and an adolescent
It ain't you boo, so get stepping

CHORUS 4X:

If you can't make we say OOO
Like the beat of this drun
Why you ask for some, you really want none
If you can't mke we say OOO
Like the beat of this groove

You don't have no business
And this is your papers
Baby you are dismissed, dismissed,
Dismissed, dismissed ...

CHORUS 2X:
