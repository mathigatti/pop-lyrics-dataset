I just wanna show you how much I appreciate you
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true
Wanna show you how much you got you girl feeling good
Wanna show you how much, how much you understood
Wanna show you how much I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me babe
Wanna show you how much I really care about your heart
Wanna show you how much I hate being apart
Show you, show you, show you till you're through with me
I wanna keep it how it is
So you can never say how it used to be


Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down

I'll be rocking on my baby, rocking, rocking on my baby
Swirling on my baby, swirling, swirling on my baby
Baby, let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
Cause it's about to go down

You'll never need two cause I'll be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop-drop-drop-dropping this thing back

This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the moonlight, for the power of love

And you know I'll never, ever, eh-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back
It's the pre game show
Daddy, you know what's up

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down

I'll be rocking on my baby, rocking, rocking on my baby
I'll be swirling on my baby, swirling, swirling on you baby
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
Cause it's about to go down

Imma take this time
To show you how much you mean to me
Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize or describe
The love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes

When I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel

Rocking on you baby, rocking, rocking on you baby
Swirling on you baby
In my mind all I can think about
Is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past
And the chance to make this love last

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down

I'll be rocking on my baby, rocking, rocking on my baby
I'll be swirling on my baby, swirling, swirling on you baby
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
Cause it's about to go down

Watch me pop it, pop it, pop-pop-pop-pop it for you baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you baby
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me throw it baby
Wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

Watch me pop it, pop it, pop-pop-pop-pop it for you baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you baby
Watch me, me it, watch me, watch me throw it baby
Wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch
