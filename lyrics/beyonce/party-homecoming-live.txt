Let's go
Woo
Fresh, fresh
Break it down
Let's go, ayy
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking 'til the morning light

'Cause we like to party, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party

You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu (Ooh)
You a bad girl and your friends bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu (Ooh)

[Beyonc√©]
As a Black woman
I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box
And Black women often feel underestimated
And I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process
Be proud of the struggle
Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain
Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right
And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves
Their sass, their honesty
Thankful for their freedom
