Aah, ooh

Beyonc√©:
Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Baby boy not a day goes by


Baby boy, baby boy, baby boy

Aah, oh my baby's fly, baby oh
Yes no hurt me so good, baby oh
I'm so wrapped up in your love let me go
Let me breathe, stay out my fantasies

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams

Baby boy, not a day goes by
Without my fantasies (by, by, by, by)
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams

Picture us dancin' real close
In a dark dark corner of a basement party
Every time I close my eyes
It's like everyone left but you and me

In our own little world
The music is the sun
The dance floor becomes the sea
Feels like true paradise to me

All right, All right

Aah, ooh

Girl

Baby boy, you stay on my mind

Baby boy, baby boy, baby boy

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams

Baby boy, not a day goes by
Without my fantasies
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Baby boy, you are so damn fine
Baby boy, won't you be mine?
Baby boy, let's conceive an angel

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Baby boy, you are so damn fine
Baby boy, won't you be mine?
Baby boy, let's conceive an angel

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams

Baby boy, not a day goes by
Without my fantasies
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams

We stepping in hotter this year
We stepping in hotter this year
I know you gon' like it
I know you gon' like it

I'm steppin' up hotter this year
I'm steppin' up hotter this year
So don't you fight it
So don't you fight it
