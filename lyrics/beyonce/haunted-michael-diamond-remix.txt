And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind
can't help but wander: how come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm touring


All these people on the planet
Working 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
All the people on the planet
Working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?

What goes up, goes around
Goes around around around around
What goes up, goes around
Goes around around around around

Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so

It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me

My heart it lulls
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

My wicked tongue
Where will it be
I know if I'm onto you
I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me

You want me? I walk down the hallway
You're lucky, the bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me

You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)

Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
