If tomorrow all the things were gone
IÂ´d worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
I'd thank my lucky stars, to be livin' here today
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away


And I'm proud to be an american
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me

And I gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

From the lakes of minnesota to the hills of tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, to New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every american heart
And it's time to make a change

That I'm proud to be an american
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me

And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

And I'm proud to be an american
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me

And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
