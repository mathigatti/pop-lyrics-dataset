There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own


And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going
on?
When every second, every minute another soul is gone?
And I believe that in my life I will see an end to
hopelessness, of giving up, of suffering

CHORUS
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love

I'm inspired and hopeful each and everyday
That's how I know that things are gonna change
So how can I pretend that I don't know what's going
on?
When every second, with every minute another soul is
gone?
And I believe that in my life I will see(I will see
yeah)
An end to hopelessness(Hopelessness), of giving
up(Giving Up), of suffering

CHORUS
If we all stand together this one time(Time)
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up for love

And it all starts right here
And it starts right now
One person stands up and the rest will follow
For all the forgotten, for all the unloved
I'm gonna sing this song
And I believe... 
...that in my life I will see an end to hopelessness,
of giving up, of suffering

CHORUS
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and sing 
Stand up for love
