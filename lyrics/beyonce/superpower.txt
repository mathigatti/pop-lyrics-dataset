When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is


And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show ya
I guess I didn't see myself before ya
Moving forward

(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Oh, like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would revolve
(I thought the world would revolve)
Without us
(Without us, without us, without us)
But nothing I know could slow us down
They couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Hey, hey
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

And just like you, I can't be scared
And just like you, I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
A tough love

(Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky and what falls
It's the superpower
(Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we've got plenty super power

(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Oh, like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, too much to bear

And I thought the world would revolve
(I thought the world would revolve)
Without us
(Without us, without us, without us)
But nothing I know could slow us down
They couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
But together we've got plenty power
But nothing I know could break us down
They couldn't break us down

Yes, we can
(Couldn't break us down)
(They couldn't break us down)
Yes, we can
(Couldn't break us down)
(They couldn't break us down)
Yes, we can
(Couldn't break us down)
We can make it, baby
(They couldn't break us down)
Yes, we can
(Couldn't break us down)
(They couldn't break us down)
