Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme
(Uishi kwa, uishi kwa)
Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme
(Uishi kwa, uishi kwa)


Yeah, yeah, and the wind is talking
Yeah, yeah, for the very first time
With a melody that pulls you towards it
Painting pictures of paradise

Saying: Rise up to the light in the sky, yeah
Watch the light lift your heart up
Burn your flame through the night

Woah, spirit, watch the heavens open (open), yeah
Spirit, can you hear it calling (calling)? Yeah

Yeah, yeah, and the water's crashing
Trying to keep your head up high
While you're trembling, that's when the magic happens
And the stars gather by, by your side

Saying: Rise up to the light in the sky, yeah
Let the light lift your heart up
Burn your flame through the night

Yeah, spirit, watch the heavens open (open), yeah
Spirit, can you hear it calling (calling)? Yeah

Your destiny is coming close
Stand up and fight
So go into that far off land
And be one with the Great I Am, I Am
A boy becomes a man

Woah, spirit, watch the heavens open (open), yeah
Spirit, can you hear it calling (calling)? Yeah
Spirit, watch the heavens open, open, yeah
Spirit, spirit, can you hear it calling (calling)? Yeah

Your destiny is coming close
Stand up and fight
So go into a far off land
And be one with the Great I Am
