Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Ooh, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!


Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooh, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, didn't I?

Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Ooh, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Oowee, baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
Here I am, baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
