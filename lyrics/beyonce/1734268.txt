[Beyoncé]
Turn the lights on!
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe
I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes
I'm goin' outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands
And be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your love is too good to be true
My guilty pleasure
I ain't going no where
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you


[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, young money right here
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddie Kruger I'm a rap bitch nightmare
And I'm richi buy you
Kill bitches elave ya body in a bayou
More brain than an IQ
More head than a dread, my youth
And my bank account ain't hardly empty
So I come through in a Barbie Bentley
But please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry
Who's next to go
My flows so flexible
Get gassed get at me, Texaco
Shoot your self in the leg, plexico
White jag with the twisted lip
I ain't Mike Jack but This is it!
Born born born everywhere
Your like baloon boy mama you was never there!
I am the kung fu panda
Fuck all your blogs, fuck all your propaganda
Good for the goose thein its good for the gander
Nicki ain't a rapper, nicki is a brander
Please you can never compare to me
All these bitches is scared of me
I am who they couldn't even dare to be
So thats all folks
I go hard pause
Hospital flow get more gauze
Imma bad bitch on all fours
The president be like it all yours
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high states
Go together like ricky and his eye patch
Go together like a team in the gym
Kareem in the ring, the queen and the king

[Beyoncé]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So if you were made
Not even death can make us part (No Ceilings)
What kinda dream is this?
You could be a sweet

[Lil Wayne]
Kush it out, red bone pussy mouth
Eat you up, spit you out
Fuck your girl in your house
I'm terrible be careful
You might want say a prayer or two
So cold I need theraflu
Im so high I need parachutes
Im error proof, im never spooked
Got my crew, heaven blue
Anda my flag red as hell, think your sweet as devils food
I never lose
My weapons use
Fuck with me wrong, shit get ugly
Devin Dude
And she's the queen
Two's a couple, three's a scene
Weezy that nigga that you see in your dreams
Get the pussy wet or be the sprigns, huh, I'm easter clean
Shout to my homegirl Mika Means
Anything we want we redeem
You niggas gassed up '93 supreme
Nicki Minaj is the hardest bitch
More than an artist bitch
She talk a whole lot of shit
And walk around like she
President Carters bitch
She be om her Barbie shit
And me I'm on the carter 6
And I can turn crumbs to bricks
And I can turn nuns to tricks
Young mula baby
Fu-fuck your feelings
And this is NO Ceilings
Yeah

[Beyoncé]
You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your love is too good to be true
My guilty pleasure
I ain't going no where
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
