I love your face
You love the taste
That sugar babe
It melts away


I kiss you and you lick your lips
(I kiss you and you lick your lips)
You like it wet and so do I
(You like it wet and so do I)
No you never waste a drip
(No you never waste a drip)
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you!

(Keep me coming, keep me going)
Keep me coming, keep me going
(Keep me humming, keep me moaning)
Keep me humming, keep me moaning
(Non-stop love until the morning)
Non-stop love until the morning
(Non-stop screaming, freaking, blowing)
Blow-oh-ohh

Can you eat the Skittles?
It’s the sweetest in the middle, yeah
Pink is the flavor, solve the riddle, yeah
I’m-a lean back, don’t worry, it’s nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It’s the only way to get the flavor
Ohhh, boy

When you’re thirsty and need love
I give it up till I’m empty baby
Must be good to you!
If you’re lonely in your bed
I’ll fill it up to the top, baby
Must be good to you!

(Keep me coming, keep me going)
Keep me coming, keep me going
(Keep me humming, keep me moaning)
Keep me humming, keep me moaning
(Non-stop love until the morning)
Non-stop love until the morning
(Non-stop screaming, freaking, blowing)
Blow-oh-ohh
