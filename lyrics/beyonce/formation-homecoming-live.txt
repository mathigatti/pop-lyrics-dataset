Baby, I'm back by popular demand
Bitch, I'm back by popular demand
I did not come to play with you hoes
I came to slay, bitch


[Beyonc√©]
Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess
Paparazzi, catch my fly and my cocky fresh
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress (stylin')
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces (woo)
My daddy Alabama, mama Louisiana
You mix that negro with that creole, make a Texas bama
I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils
Earned all this money, but they never take the country out me
I got hot sauce in my bag, swag

I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow bone it
Dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it
I twirl on my haters, albino alligators
El camino with the seat low, sippin' cuervo with no chaser
Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard)
Take what's mine (take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star)
'Cause I slay (slay), I slay (hey), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)
All day (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)
We gon' slay (slay), gon' slay (okay), we slay (okay), I slay (okay)
I slay (okay), okay (okay), I slay (okay), okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, 'cause I slay
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, 'cause I slay
Come on, prove to me you got some coordination, 'cause I slay
Slay trick, or you get eliminated

When he fuck me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster ('cause I slay)
('Cause I slay)
If he hit it right, I might take him on a flight on my chopper (I slay)
Drop him off at the mall, let him buy some J's, let him shop up (I slay)
I might get your song played on the radio station ('cause I slay)
I might get your song played on the radio station ('cause I slay)
You just might be a black Bill Gates in the making ('cause I slay)
I just might be a black Bill Gates in the making

I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow bone it
I dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it
I twirl on my haters, albino alligators
El camino with the seat low, sippin' cuervo with no chaser
Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard)
Take what's mine (take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star)
'Cause I slay (slay), I slay (hey), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)
I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)
Do you slay? (slay) gon' slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)
You slay (okay), okay (okay), I slay (okay), okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, ladies, now let's get in formation (I slay)
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation (I slay)
Prove to me you got some coordination (I slay)
Slay trick, or you get eliminated (I slay)

Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation (I slay)
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation
You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation
Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper
