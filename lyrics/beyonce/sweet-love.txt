Sweet Love
With all my heart I love you, baby
Stay with me and you will see
My arms will hold you, baby
Never leave, 'cause I believe


I'm in love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name, I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way

Oh your heart has called me closer to you
I will be all that you need
Just trust in what we`re feeling
Never leave `cause baby, I believe

In this love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name, I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way

No stronger love in this world
Oh baby no, you`re my man, I`m your girl
I'll never go, wait and see, can't be wrong
Don't you know this where you belong

Sweet, sweet and lovely baby
Stay right here, never fear
I will be all that you need
Never leave, `cause baby, I believe

In this love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name, I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way
