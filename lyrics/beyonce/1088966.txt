Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Ooh yeah,


Verse 1
It's over and done, but the heartache lives on inside
And who is the one you're clinging to, instead of me tonight?

Bridge
And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

Chorus
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion taking me over
caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
But if you don't come back, come home to me darling
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world to hold on the time
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight

Goodnight
Goodnight

Verse 2
I'm there at your side,
I'm part of all the things you are
But you've got a part of someone else
You gotta go find your shining star

Repeat bridge
Repeat chorus

Good night

Repeat bridge
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotions, taking me over
caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
(Don't you know I'm lost without you baby?)
But if you don't come back, come home to me darling
Nobody left in this world to hold on the time
(Nobody, nobody to hold me)
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
(Nobody to kiss me, yeah)

Goodnight
Goodnight
