The big homie better hold up
Big homie better hold up
My whoadies 'bout to roll up
Young whoadies 'bout to stroll up
They comin' through the back door


The big homie better hold up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to roll up
I see them boppers in the corner
Sneaking out the back door

We really could be
Living young, wild and free

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away (far away)
I ain't fucking with nobody
Toast to the good life
Suicide before you see my tears in my eyes
Me and my daughter, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life

Big homie better hold up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to roll up
I say my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
They comin' through the back door

Big homie better hold up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
Sneaking out the back door

We really could be
Living young, wild and free

Hell no, I ain't gon' call you back
Chase me 'round the world just to fall back
Ain't nobody got no time for that
Tryna keep my family right
Swear you're giving me your heart, but I don't care (don't care)
Better call Becky with the good hair (good hair)
You only want me when I'm not there
Boy, you better get in line

Sometimes I regret the day I put this ring on
Looking at my watch he should've been home
He always got them motherfucking excuses
I pray to God you reveal to me what his truth is

Hey, big homie better grow up
Ask you something then you choke up
Me and my whoadies gonna roll up
Beating down your back door

Big homie better hold up
You've been running game on the wrong one
I'm runnin' so fast for the long run
Runnin' out the back door

We truly could have been
Living young, wild and free
We truly could have been
Living young, wild and free
