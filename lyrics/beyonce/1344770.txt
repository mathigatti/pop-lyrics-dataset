(Hello) hello
How are you (oh)
I just got to say I hold you
You know I had some things to do
Go lean up in me
You know
I guess I was kind of shy (how about)
Someone who writes for a dream
Or maybe you can see
Maybe you can sing a song (mmm)


(Tonight I'm bout to have fun)

(I dial...)

[Chorus:]
632-5792(number)
632-5792(mmm)
632-5792
632-5792(he said: call me anytime)
632-5792
632-5792
632-5792
632-5792

[verse 2:]
We talked about love songs (on and on and on)
There's nothing wrong with calling, a quite song
And havinig them play a song for me
A song for you, a song for me a song
It's getting late
And I can't wait
I have to go to sleep
I'm happy I will speak
But maybe I will be dreaming...

[hook:]
Dream of you
And we sing a lullaby (sing a lullaby)
Underneath a cherry tree
As softly passes by
And carries us away
High in the sky
When I your way

(You know I'm going to die)

[Chorus:]
632-5792(sing me a lalaby)
632-5792(I think I'll call you tonight)
632-5792(oooohhhh)
632-5792(yeahh)
632-5792(you baby)
632-5792(ooohh oh oh yeah)
632-5792(you and me)
632-5792
632-5792(I just call to say hi)
632-5792
632-5792
