I said yes to your number
And yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes


I said yes we can be together
Yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes

You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watchin me baby
I was watchin you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me
I said hello to you 

You ask me where I'm from 
I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye
I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night
So I gave my number to you

I said yes you number
And yes to you datin me
Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me

The first time I say no 
It's like I never said yes
I said yes we can be together
Yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes

Certainly you can call me baby
I love to hear from you
Yes of course you can come and see me boy
I want to get to know you more
I'm feelin you
No baby, not yet, we can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset
Boy you act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful

You was at my house
I was sittin' on my couch
You was really beggin' 
So I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you

You had a lotta nerve
You too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn
You said I move to slow
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said don't call no more
It's cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
Cuz you show me your true face baby
The first time I said no
