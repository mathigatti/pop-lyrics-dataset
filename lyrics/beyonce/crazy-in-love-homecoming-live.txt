Coachella, you ready?
Let's go get 'em
Yes! So crazy right now!
Most incredibly, it's your girl, yes, B
History in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now


[Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Yeah, I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so, looking so, looking so

Drop it
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no

(B)
When I talk to my friends so quietly
(Who he think he is?)
Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
The beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now (Yeah)
Got me looking so crazy right now (So, crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
So crazy right now, so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now (Hey)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Hey)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Coachella)
So crazy right now, so crazy right now (Y'all dance with me, come on)
