What happened at the New Orleans?
Bitch, I'm back by popular demand


[Beyoncé]
Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess
Paparazzi, catch my fly and my cocky fresh
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress (stylin'!)
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces
My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole, make a Texas bama

I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils
Earned all this money, but they never take the country out me
I got hot sauce in my bag, swag

[(Messy Mya) &amp; Big Freedia]

I like cornbreads and collard greens, bitch
Oh, yes, you besta believe it
