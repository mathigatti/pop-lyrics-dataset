I grew up in Houston, Texas visiting Prairie View
We rehearsed at TSU for many years in Third Ward
And I always dreamed of going to an HBCU
My college was Destiny's Child
My college was traveling around the world and life was my teacher
I wanted a Black orchestra. I wanted the steppers
I needed the vocalists
'Cause I wanted different characters—I didn't want us all doing the same thing
And the amount of swag is just limitless
Like, the things that these young people can do with their bodies
And the music they can play and the drumrolls
And the haircuts and the bodies and the—
It's just not right
It's just so much damn swag
