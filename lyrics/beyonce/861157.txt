Ay, ay, ay
(Nobody likes being played)
Oh, Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Oh, Shakira, Shakira


He said I'm worth it
His one desire
(I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about)
He kissed me, his one and only
Yes, beautiful liar
(Tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about)

You never know
Why are we the ones to suffer
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry

Ay, let's not kill the karma
Ay, let's not start a fight
Ay, it's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar

Oh, can't we laugh about it? (Ha, ha, ha)
Oh, it's not worth our time
Oh, we can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you
I saw you together
(I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again)
I walked in on your love scene
Slow dancing
(You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong? Yeah)

You never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone

Ay, let's not kill the karma
Ay, let's not start a fight
Ay, it's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar

Oh, can't we laugh about it? (Ha, ha, ha)
Oh, it's not worth our time
Oh, we can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

Tell me how to forgive you
When it's me who's ashamed?
And I wish could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame

Ay, Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Ay, Shakira, Shakira
Oh, Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Oh, Shakira, Shakira

Ay, let's not kill the karma
Ay, let's not start a fight
Ay, it's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar

Oh, can't we laugh about it? (Ha, ha, ha)
Oh, it's not worth our time
Oh, we can live without him
Just a beautiful liar
