(Chorus A) 
Ladies leave your man at home 
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full
grown 
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends 
Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin',
jumpin' 


(Chorus B) 
Though he say he got a girl 
Yeah it's true you got a man 
But the party ain't gon' stop 
So let's make it hot, hot 

Last weekend you stayed at home alone and lonely 
Couldn't find your man, he was chillin' with his
homies 
This weekend you're going out 
If he try to to stop you, you're goin' off 
You got your hair done and your nails done too 
A new outfit and your Fendi shoes 
And when you're through parlayin' at the hottest spot 
Tonight you're gonna find the fellas 
Rollin' in the Lexus, drops and Hummers 

(Chorus B) 

(Chorus A - 2x) 

(Chorus B) 

Call your boys cause tonight you're not gonna stay at
home 
Should tell your girl she ain't comin' tonight 
You're goin' solo 
Cut her off cause she talk some noise 
You know you got the right to get your party on 
So get your haircut and your car washed too 
Lookin' like a star in your Armani suit 
You need to look your best cause you're turnin' heads
tonight 
You're gonna find a sexy chica that's gonna dance all
night 
If you wanna 

(Chorus B) 

(Chorus A - 2X) 

(Chorus B) 

Sexy women do that dance 
Fly ladies work your man 
Balling fellas time to clown 
We can get down now 

Bounce baby, bounce, bo-bounce bounce, bo-bounce 
Twirk it, twirk it 
Shake baby, shake sha-shake shake 
Work it, work it 
Twist baby, twist tw-twist 
You better dip that thing 
(One more time papi's mommies) 

Bounce baby, bounce, bo-bounce bounce, bo-bounce 
Twirk it, twirk it 
Shake baby, shake sha-shake shake 
Work it, work it 
Twist baby, twist tw-twist 
You better dip that thing 
(Bounce it up and down papi's mommies) 

Sexy women do that dance 
Fly ladies work your man 
Balling fellas time to clown 
We can get down now 
(Chorus A - 4X) 


I ain't thinkin' about my man tonight 
Uh huh, I ain't worried my girl aight 
(Chorus A until fade)
