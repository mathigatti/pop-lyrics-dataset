I will always

So I'll go but I know
I'll think of you
Every step of the way


And I, will always love you
I will always love you
You

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make up a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away

Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
