Yeah, yeah oh
Yeah, yeah yeah


That's the way everyday goes
Every time we have no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Half way on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool in this good life
Won't let you down when it's all ruined

Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Good Glory, dear
It's all downhill from here

In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nose dive in the flood lines
Tall tower, milk crate
It's the same way you showed me
Cannon ball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (you showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it up when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Where God could fear
It's all downhill from here

What a life
Remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all in this year
Say what up to Magic, just shoot
Say what up to Penny
Say what up to life one more time
And I know what you might want to know
Run from me and your team
Still ain't grabbin six (take it easy)
Give me somethin' sweet
Bitch I might bite, ain't no tellin'
This is life, life immortality
