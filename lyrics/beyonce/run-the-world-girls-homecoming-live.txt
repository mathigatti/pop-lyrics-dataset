(Girls)
Coachella, thank you for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline Coachella (girls)
Ainâ€™t that 'bout a bitch? (Girls)
This song is dedicated to all the incredible women that opened up the doors for me
Thank you so much, ladies
Do we have any strong women out there tonight?
Sing along


Girls, we run this motha, yeah
Girls, we run this motha, yeah
Girls, we run this motha, yeah
Girls, we run this mutha (here we go)

Who run the world? Girls 
Who run the world? Girls
Who run the world? Girls 
Who run the world? Girls 
Who run this motha? Girls
Who run this motha? Girls
Who run this motha? Girls
Who run this motha? Girls

Some of them men think they freak this
Like we do, but no, they don't
Make your check, come at they neck
Disrespect us, no, they won't
This goes out to all my girls
That's in the club rocking the latest
Who will buy it for themselves and get more money later
I think I need a barber
None of these niggas can fight me
I'm so good with this, I remind you, I'm so hood with this
Boy, I'm just playing, oh, come here, baby
Hope you still like me, F you, pay me

My persuasion can build a nation
Endless power, with our love, we can devour
You'll do anything for me
Who run the world? Girls

Who run the world? Girls 
Who run the world? Girls 
Who run the world? Girls 
Who run the world? Girls 
Who run this motha? Girls
Who run this motha? Girls
Who run this motha? Girls
Who run this motha? Girls
Who run the world? Girls 
Who run the world? Girls
Who run the world? Girls 
Who run the world? Girls

Who are we? (Who are we?)
What we run? (What we run?)
The world (who run this motha?)
Who are we? (Who are we?)
What do we run? (What do we run?)
We run the world (we run this motha)
Who are we? What we run? We run the world
Who run the world? Girls

[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
But for the attention of men
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes
