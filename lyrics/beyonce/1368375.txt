I be on the hotline
Like err'day
Makin' sure the DJ know
What I want him to play


You know I got my top back
And my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades
And turnin' up my radio
Turnin' up my radio

I think I'm in love with my radio
Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound

Whenever I hear that sound

Whenever I hear that sound

The only one that papa allowed
To hang out in my room
With the door closed
We'd be alone

And mama never freaked out
When she heard it go boom
'Cause she knew we
Were in the zone

Hold him in my arms
And look out on my window
Under the moonlight

And he, deep, keepin' my close
So I never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

I think I'm in love with my radio
Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound

Whenever I hear that sound

Whenever I hear that sound

When I get into my car, turn it up
Then I hear vibrations all up in my trunk
And then bass all be rattlin' through my seats
Then that crazy feeling starts happening

I get butterflies when I hear the DJ
Playing the stuff I like
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
He's got a place in my heart

I think I'm in love with my radio
Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound

Whenever I hear that sound

Whenever I hear that sound

I be on the hotline,
Like err'day
Makin' sure the DJ know
What I want him to play

You know I got my top back
And my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades
And turnin' up my radio
Turn up my radio

I think I'm in love with my radio
Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound

Whenever I hear that sound

Whenever I hear that sound
