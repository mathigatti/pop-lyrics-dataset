Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm


She gon' be rockin' Chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Pent in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if let you go

Tell me how should I feel when I know what I know
And my female intuition telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames, I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations, what you mean you gon' choke?

Oh-ooh, you can't stay, you gotta go
Oh-ooh, but ain't no other chick spending your dough?
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

She gon' be rockin' Chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Pent in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if let you go

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel when you made me belong?
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it, and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

Oh-ooh, he's so arrogant and bold
Oh-ooh, but she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'mma cause

She gon' be rockin' Chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Pent in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if let you go

Oh-ooh, how can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Oh-ooh, why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
Oooh, but this is my show, and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me and not see all the things?

She gon' be rockin' Chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Pent in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if let you go
