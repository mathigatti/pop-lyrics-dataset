I can see what's happening (I can't, what?)
And they don't have a clue (who's they?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trios down to two (oh, I get it)
The sweet caress of twilight (yeah)
There's magic everywhere (it's everywhere)
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air!


Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings?
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me

He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside?

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings?
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed
