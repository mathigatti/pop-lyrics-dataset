Couldn't tell little jackie nothing
Sixteen thought she knew it all
She was searching for the love she missed (yeah)
And so, she ran away


[Chorus]
Slow down, your moving way to fast
Sixteen, there's so much for you ahead
Sweet sixteen, do you know where your running too, do
you know...
Sweet Sixteen

She fell in love with a man who was so fine,(So fine)
He made her promises
She didn't stop to think if he was serious
Until she had his baby...Sweet Sixteen

[Chorus]
Slow down how, your moving way to fast
Sixteen, there's so much for you ahead, oh
Sweet sixteen,Sweet Sixteen, do you know where your
going too
Feel like you've got no where to go

[Bridge]
Sixteen years,
Sixteen prayers,
Sixteen reasons why I care
Sixteen tears,
Your sixteen still,
Sweet Sixteen...Girl

I know your feeling lonely, "
Who your gonna turn to, "
feels like the world closing in, on you..on you
Sweet Sixteen,
You need to cherish what you have,
You can forgot about the past
Now you can start all over, "
and cherish your life

[Chorus]
Slow down, your moving way too fast
You are only Sixteen, there's so much more to life
ahead, whoa!
Sweet sixteen,Sweet Sixteen,do you know where your
running too
Sweet Sixteen, girl I know,it gets hard so take it
slow
Sweet sixteen,Sweet Sixteen,do you know where your
going too

Ba Ba Ba Ba

At sixteen, do you know where your going too
Slow down, do you know where your going too

Sweet sixteen
At sixteen
(repeat till fade)
