Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'mma walk, I'mma march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord, forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'mma rain, I'mma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new


Ooh, I'm telling these tears: Go and fall away, fall away
Oh, may the last one burn into flames

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose, yeah
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves!

I'mma wade, I'mma wave through the waters
Tell the tide: Don't move
I'mma riot, I'mma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord, forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'mma wade, I'mma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

I'm telling these tears: Go and fall away, fall away
Oh, may the last one burn into flames

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose, yeah
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves!

Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction (come on!)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me, try for me
Live for me, breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me, I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me, wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

[Beyoncé]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose, yeah
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves!

[Kendrick Lamar]
Huh, what you want from me?
Is it truth you seek, huh?
Oh, father, can you hear me?
Huh, what you want from me?
Is it truth you seek, huh?
Oh, father, can you hear me?
Hear me out

[Hattie White]
I had my ups and downs
But I always find the inner strength to pull myself up
I was served lemons
But I made lemonade
