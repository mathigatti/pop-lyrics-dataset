Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this! (WHOO!)


Barely moved, we've arrived
Lookin' sexy, lookin' fly
Baddest chick, chick inside
Dj, Gemini
Spotted me a tender thang
There you are, come on baby
Don't you wanna, dance with me
Can you handle, handle me?

You gotta do much better if you gone dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly if you gone dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully if you like what you see
Move, groove, prove you can handle me
By the looks I got you shook up and scared of me
Hook up your seatbelt it's time for takeoff

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this!

I'm about to break you off
H-town goin hard
Lead my hips, slap my thighs
Swing my hair, square my eyes
Lookin' hot, smellin' good
Groovin' like I'm from the hood
Look over my shoulder, I blow you a kiss
Can you handle, handle this?

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

Move your body up and down (whoo!)
Make your booty touch the ground (whoo!)
I can't help but wonder why (whoo!)
Is my vibe to vibealacious for you, babe

I shake my jelly at every chance
When I whip with my hip you slip into a trance
I'm hopin you can handle all this jelly that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz

(Scatting)

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
(repeat it x6)
