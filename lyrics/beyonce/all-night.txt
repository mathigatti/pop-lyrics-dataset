I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
(True love never has to hide)
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
(Trade your broken wings for mine)
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime
(Seen your scars and kissed your crime)


So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
You're all I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)

Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light
If you get deep, you touch my mind
(If you get deep, you touch my mind)
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes
(Baptize your tears and dry your eyes)

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
You're all I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain (pain)
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away (chip, chip, chip away)
Oh, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became a remedy

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)

How I missed you, my love
