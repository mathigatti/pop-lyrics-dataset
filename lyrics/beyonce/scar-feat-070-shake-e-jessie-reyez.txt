[070 Shake]
I wonder how it, how it went so wrong
It's been so dark, yeah, I wanna say my last goodbyes
And I'll be gone for good, left you guys behind
Oh, I'm so lonely, so lonely, ooh


[Jessie Reyez]
In the jungle, ain't no bible
Showtime, showtime, no recital
Show no fear, boy, where's your spinal?
Where's your backbone? Where's your pyro?
I had to be everything you couldn't be for my survival
My own idol skipped my trial
Took my rightful, rightful title
No remorse, the sin is final
I found all my own disciples
I'm too far gone, downward spiral
No white angels, just albinos
Check my eyes, man, they're all white, man
Roll them back now, where'd the light go?
Guess it died so, cold like Kryo
Crack my neck back like I'm the chiro

[070 Shake]
I want your world at my feet
I want your world at my feet
I've waited too long for this
I've waited too long for this
I wanted the world out to me
I want your world at my feet
I waited too long for this
I need this like oxygen

Sorry, sorry
My own family
I slayed you, betrayed you
Don't you grow to be like me
I'm under, sinking to the darkest sea
Darkest sea, eeh, ooh
