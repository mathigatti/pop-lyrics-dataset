[Beyoncé]
Six inch heels
She walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn
She murdered everybody and I was her witness


[The Weeknd]
She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
(You know) pesos out of Mexico
(De uno) commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy
She already made enough, but she'll never leave

[Beyoncé]
Six inch heels
She walked in the club like nobody's business

She works for the money
She'll work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar
She worth every dollar
And she worth every minute

She works for the money
She works for the money
She works for the money

She stack her money, money everywhere she goes
(She got de uno) her Yamazaki straight from Tokyo
(Oh, baby, you know) she got them commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up 'cause she professional

Six inch heels
She walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn
She murdered everybody and I was her witness

She works for the money
She'll work for the money
From the start to the finish

Stars in her eyes
She fights for the power, keeping time
She grinds day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday, oh

She gon' slang
She too smart to crave material things
She pushing herself day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday, oh

Stars in her eyes
She fights and she sweats those sleepless nights
But she don't mind, she loves the grind
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday, yeah

She gon' slang
Too smart to crave material things
Stacking her paper, stacking her cake up
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday, yeah

Six inch heels
She walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn
She murdered everybody and I was her witness

She works for the money
She'll work for the money

From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar
She worth every dollar (love me)
And she worth every minute

Now, boy, I'll make you feel
You'll always come back to me

Come back
