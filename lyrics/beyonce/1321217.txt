It's like it can go through anything
And even when you think it can't it finds a way to still push on, though

Ain't got the patience for the pain
And if you don't believe it look into
your heart the beat goes on

Things get better
Through whatever
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up

But the heart keeps telling you don't give up

questioning, wondering what is what
Don't give up
THROUGH IT ALL, JUST STAND UP!
