Remember those walls I built
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make up a sound


I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away(10x)

Remember those walls I built
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make up a sound

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
I Pray it won't fade away

Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

Halooooooooooohhhhhhhhh
Haloooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh
oooooooooooohhhhhhhh
oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Everywhere I'm looking now
(Everywhere I'm looking now)
I'm surrounded by your embrace
(I'm surrounded by your embrace)
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
(You're everything I need and more)
(It's written all over your face)
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away(8x)

Haloooooooooooooohhhhhhhhh
