Feel my body
That means come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body

I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
Ain't no shame, 'cause I gotta get mine
Swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Call me, boy, and let me work on you
I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied, gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied, gettin' bodied
You want my body, won't you get my body?
