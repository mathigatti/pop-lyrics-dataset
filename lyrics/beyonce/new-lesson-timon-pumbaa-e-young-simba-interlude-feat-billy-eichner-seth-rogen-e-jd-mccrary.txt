[Simba]
Who are you?


[Pumbaa]
I'm Pumbaa, this is Timon

[Timon]
Look, kid
Bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?

[Simba]
Right

[Timon]
Wrong!
When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world

[Pumba]

[Simba]
Well, that's not what I was taught

[Timon]
Well, then maybe you need a new lesson
Repeat after me, kid
