Six inch heels
She walked in the club like nobody's business

She works for the money
She works for the money

Stars in her eyes
She fights for the power, keeping time
She grinds day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday, oh

She too smart to crave material things
She pushing herself day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday

She fights and she sweats those sleepless nights
But she don't mind, she loves the grind
She grinds from Monday to Friday

Too smart to crave material things
Stacking her paper, stacking her cake up

From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar
She worth every dollar
(Love me)
And she worth every minute

Now, boy, I'll make you feel
You'll always come back to me

Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back, come back, come back

It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

My wicked tongue
Where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you
I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You're lucky
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me!
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

My wicked tongue
Where will it be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me

You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)

Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)

Found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
(True love never has to hide)
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
(Trade your broken wings for mine)
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime
(Seen your scars and kissed your crime)

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)

Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light
If you get deep, you touch my mind
(If you get deep, you touch my mind)
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes
(Baptize your tears and dry your eyes)

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long (all night, all night)

All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain (pain)
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away (chip, chip, chip away)
Oh, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became a remedy

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long (all night, all night)

How I missed you, my love
