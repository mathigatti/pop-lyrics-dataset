(Chorus 4x) 
I know you see me watching you 
And I see you watching me 
Cuz boy your body's callin' 
The temptation is killin' me 


I'm chillin' at the spot and my posse's 4 deep 
Had my man on my mind, turn my head, what did I see 
The fellas lookin' fly, there was one that caught my
eye 
So I bit my lip, switched my hips as I walked by 
Sayin' "Sexy boy, you so fly 
I just might give you a try 
I'ma write yo' number in the palm of my hand 
Oops, I forgot I got a man" 

(Chorus 4x) 

I'm thinkin' to myself, should I even take the chance?

Should I do what's on my mind or should I stay down
with my man? 
This boy here got me fiendin' and I'm wantin' him so
bad 
Should I chill when I'm with him 
and risk everything I have 
Saying "Sexy boy, you so fly 
I wish I could give you a try 
But my man's at home waiting for me by the phone 
Sorry, can't get my groove on" 

(Chorus 4x) 

(Bridge 2x) 
Temptation is callin' 
I be wantin' you so bad I could cry 
Relationship's callin' me 
To do what's wrong, but I gotta do right 

(Chorus 4x) 

(Bridge 2x) 

(Chorus to fade)
