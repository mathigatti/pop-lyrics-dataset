[verse 1]
You were my best friend
and I love you
You were always there to love me,
when I didn't even love myself
You bring out the best in me
and I thank you
Thank you for my life
Thank you for your refreshing wisdom,
and your strenght

And if you wasn't for you
And if I didn't know you
And if you never reached me
And if you didn't teach me

I wouldn't be, who I am right now
I wouldn't give, what I give right now
I wouldn't think, what I think right now
I'm thanking you, Im thanking you

For trusting me
And loving me
With you're love
