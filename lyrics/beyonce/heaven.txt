I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving


But heaven couldn't wait for you
No, heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed

Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, heaven couldn't wait for you
No, heaven couldn't wait for you

No, heaven couldn't wait for you
No, heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

So go on go home
