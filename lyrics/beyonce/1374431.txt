I lay alone awake at night, sorrow feels my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
But whose gonna be mine?


Who's there to save the hero, oh
When she's left all alone, and she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero, oh
Who's there to save the girl after she saves the world
After she saves the world

I bottle all my hurt inside, I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life
I serve the world a gesture, someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this burried treasure, they both lead to a higher goal

Who's there to save the hero, oh
When she's left all alone, and she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero, oh
Who's there to save the girl after she saves the world

After she saves the world (after she saves the world)
After she saves the world
After she saves the world

I've given too much of myself and now it's driving me crazy
I'm crying out for help
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here and save me
Save me from myself

Who's there to save the hero, oh
When she's left all alone, and she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero, oh
Who's there to save the girl after she saves the world

After she saves the world (after she saves the world)
After she saves the world
After she saves the world
After she saves the world
After she saves the world
