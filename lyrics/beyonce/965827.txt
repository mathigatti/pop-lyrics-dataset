He's always laughing and flirting with me and
You act like you don't even care
As a matter a fact, you've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there


He says that you don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right

Baby

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me

Let this happen, and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, ooh baby
If you let him take me from you

Why is it that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you, dance or whatever
And your homeboys' more interested than you

He pays more attention to me that you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too

Baby

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me

Let this happen, and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, ooh baby
If you let him take me from you

Boy when I tried to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
You want some lovin', that's when it's cool
But baby boy, I'm not a fool

Boy, oh!

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
(Ooh!) you never wanted me

Let this happen, and it proves
(No no no!)
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, ooh baby
(How can you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you
(Are you gonna let him take me from you)

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see (x2)
If you let him take me from you
(No no)you never wanted me

Let this happen, and it proves
(Just let me go)
That your love was never true
(Let me go)
If you let him take me from you, ooh baby
(Just let me know)
If you let him take me from you
