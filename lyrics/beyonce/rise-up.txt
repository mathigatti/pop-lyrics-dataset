I'm the matriarch of your land
When you need to, take my hand
Come into my arms
I'll keep you safe from harm
I'll keep your precious heart


Some people try to drag you down
Take care for me stand and be proud
You're a warrior, you're my warrior
Be who you are, be who you are
Know that life holds more than what you see
Rise up little man, rise, I will

Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight for u, we will fight,
Little woman, we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand, we will fight for u, we will fight for u
We will stand and together we will rise

They'll burn you at the stake if you
Don't act like they want you to
But baby be yourself
Do good and help the world
Be who you are, be who you are
Know that life holds more than what you see
Rise up little man, rise, I will

Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight for u, we will fight,
Little woman, we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand, we will fight for u, we will fight for u
We will stand and together we will rise

Rise up, rise up little man
Don't be scared, I'm holding your hand
Know that life holds more
Than what we see and what we get
Rise up, rise up little woman
Don't be afraid to risk it all
Know that life holds more
Than what we see and what we get
I will

Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight for u, we will fight,
Little woman, we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand, we will fight for u, we will fight for u
We will stand and together we will rise
