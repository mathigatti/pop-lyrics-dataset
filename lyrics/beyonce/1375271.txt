I heard
Church bells ring
I heard
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring


Oooh, oh

I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart

All i could do
Was cry
All i could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That i love
And all
I could do
Was cry

And now
The wedding
Is over
Rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending

Ooh

All i could do
Was cry
All i could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That i love
And all
I could do
Was cry
