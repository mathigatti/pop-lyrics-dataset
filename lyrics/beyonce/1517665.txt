Feel like I'm losing my mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe
You belong to me, oh oh
I'm going through difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesnt feel like this
This is my final wish


The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please dont stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back your hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go
Let me do B

You've got me chasing after you
Like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of luck
(And my heart just melts)

You've got me chasing after you
Like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of luck
(And my heart just melts)

Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I've caught up
I'm chasing you again
Finally you stopped and I jumped on
I realized the flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holdin on
You looked and I was gone, no

The next your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please dont stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back your hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go
Let me do B

You've got me chasing after you
Like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of luck
(And my heart just melts)

You've got me chasing after you
Like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of luck
(And my heart just melts)

You got me
Chasing you
I try my luck
I can't catch up
Cause you got me
Chasing you
My hearts melting
It's like ice cream

You got me
Chasing you

I can't catch up
Cause you got me
Chasing you
My hearts melting
It's like ice cream

I've been chasing after you
(You got me chasing after you)
Now it's time to let you go
(Like an ice cream truck)
Yes, I try time and time again
(I try my best to catch up but)
But you don't love me
(It's always out of luck)
It's got to end
(And my heart just melts)

I tried so hard
(You got me chasing after you)
Damn there lost my mind
(Like an ice cream truck)
'Cause real love is hard to find
(I try my best to catch up but)
Now my heart can't take no more
(It's always out of luck)
Now I know boy you ain't mine
(And my heart just melts)

No, no (you've got me chasing after you)
No, no (like an ice cream truck)

It's always out of (it's always out of luck)
