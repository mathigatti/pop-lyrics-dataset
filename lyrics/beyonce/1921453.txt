When I'm here in your arms, I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinching myself, I don't care, I'm with you, you with me
I never wished on a star when a star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in my dreams


When I close my eyes
I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep
Knowing that tonight you'll be here with me

(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe, no
(Without you, babe)
(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I ain't letting go
(I ain't letting go)

'Cause everything I love is about you, babe
(About you, babe)
So I'd rather be here dreaming
Than waking up with nobody home
If that's the only way to be with you
Then dreaming you is where I belong

I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
It's like I'm where I'm supposed to be

'Cause when I close my eyes
I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep
Knowing that tonight you'll be here with me

(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe, no
(Without you babe)
(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I ain't letting go
(I ain't letting go)

'Cause everything I love is about you, babe
(About you, babe)
So I'd rather be here dreaming
Than waking up with nobody home
If that's the only way to be with you
Then dreaming you is where I belong

It took a lifetime just to get with you
To be with you, baby
And now that I'm here with you, I'm gonna take it in
Breathe you in, yeah, yeah
And if I am dreaming
Let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I'd rather dream about you
Than be living life wthout me and you, you

(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe, no
(Without you, babe)
(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I ain't letting go
(I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe
(About you, babe)

So I'd rather be here dreaming
Than waking up with nobody home
If that's the only way to be with you
Then dreaming you is where I belong

(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe, no
(Without you, babe)
(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I ain't letting go
(I ain't letting go)

'Cause everything I love is about you, babe
(About you, babe)
'Cause I'd rather be here dreaming
Than waking up with nobody home
If that's the only way to be with you
Then dreaming you is where I belong
