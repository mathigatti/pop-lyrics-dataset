I don't wanna wake, wake

Excuse me? Um, I love you
Who starts a conversation like that? Nobody but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up or hide you
I'll get you out my mind, hmm, I try to
Why you? In my dreams, I knew
You knew how to be there, you knew how to treat it
You knew how to keep it, I wanna do more than touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you up to
We can leave right now, nigga, you don't need a duffle
La Perla, provocateur of secrets
How is it a secret if I know you're gonna peep it?
I see you peeking, don't wanna hear a peep
Wait


Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
You're such a dream
If you can believe?
Boy you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah

Hey there, boy, I love you
I'm feeling like I know you, I can't help but wanna thug you
I'm watching all these broads trying so damn hard
But I can't even blame 'em 'cause you're so irresistible
I want to stand and yell, I won't ever dare to tell
I think I heard some wedding bells (keep that to yourself)
Is this real?
Ooh child, I can stop praying now
Past life, let's rewind
To the day when I met you
Throwback
Dear God, how could I forget you?
Your sex
Boy, it feels just like a dream to me
Now

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
You're such a dream
(You're such dream)
If you can believe?
Boy you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah

So to whom
It may concern
Please don't disturb me
Can't you see?
I'm happy, happily sleep, yeah

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
I don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
You're such a dream
(You're such dream)
If you can believe?
Boy you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah

Ma ma, ma ma
(Don't mess with my baby
They better not mess with my baby)
