Stop the track, lemme state facts
I've told you: Gimme a minute and I'll be right back
Fifty million 'round the world and they say that I couldn't get it
I've been got so sick and filthy with benjis, I can't spend it

How you gon' be talking shit?
You act like I just got up in it
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute
I know you read the paper, the one that they call a queen
Every radio round the world know me 'cause that's where I be (first!)

Gettin' money, diva's gettin' money
If you ain't gettin' money then you ain't got nothing fo' me

Tell me somethin' (tell me somethin')

Well, my ladies up in here, they like to talk back (they like to talk back)

Since fifteen in my stilettos been strutting in this game
What's your age? was the question they asked when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe her, you see how she getting paid?
She ain't callin' him to greet her, don't need him, her bed's made

This is a stick up, stick up
I need them bags, all that money
A stick up, stick up
You see them ask, where that money?
All my ladies get it up
I see you, I do the same
Take it to another level
No passengers on my plane

I'm a diva (hey!)
I'm a, I'm a, a diva (hey!)
I'm a, I'm a, a diva (hey!)
