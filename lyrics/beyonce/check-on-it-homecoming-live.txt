Can I take this back?
Sing it, y'all


Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it?
I might let you work up on it
Ladies, let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

If you got it, flaunt it, boy, I know you want it
While I turn around you, watch me check up on it
Ooh, you watchin' me shake it, I see it in ya face
You can't take it, it's blazin', you watch me in amazement
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it
If you don't go braggin', I might let you have it
You think that I'm teasin', but I ain't got no reason
I'm sure that I can please ya, but first I gotta read you

Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see
Hey
Won't you come over and check up on it
I'ma let you work up on it
I wanna see y'all do the dance
Ladies, let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
You ready? I'm watching to see if you know it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight
Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies, let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight
