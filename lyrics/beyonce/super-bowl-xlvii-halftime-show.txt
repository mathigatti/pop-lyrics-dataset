Baby, it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see


Baby, baby it's you
Come on baby it's you
Come on baby it's you
When I need you baby everything stops

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cuz I know I don't understand
Just how your love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no

Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing

Decided to dip, but now you wanna trip
Cuz another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, you're up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Cried my tears, three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

Cuz if you liked it
Then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it
Then you should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it
Then you should have put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Cuz if you liked it
Then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it
Then you should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it

Put your hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up

Cuz if you liked it
Then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it
Then you should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it

Put your hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up

Cuz if you liked it

Remember those walls I built
Well baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere we're looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo
Can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo
Can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo
Can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo
Can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo
