I been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine
Oh, mine, oh, mine, oh, mine
Been having conversations about break-ups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since then, baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh


'Cause if we are
We're taking this a little too far
With me being where ever I'm at
Worrying about where ever you are
We're taking this a little too far

On my mind, I pass my bed time
No rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this
And let's get carried away

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now you know where I stay

I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard you're mine, you're mine

MTV, welcome to my world

Pretty hurts
What's your aspiration in life?
To be happy

It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

t's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me

You want me?
I want it done my way
You like it?
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me!
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

Ride around, ride around in that action
Those candles in your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First go through my legs, go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

Baby, put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

'Cause you're no angel either, baby

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no, no, no"

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

If you keep me your promise, I'm keeping mine, hey

Must be good to you

(Keep me coming, keep me going)
Keep me coming, keep me going
(Keep me humming, keep me moaning)
Keep me humming, keep me moaning
(Non-stop love until the morning)
Non-stop love until the morning
(Non-stop screaming, freaking, blowing)
Blow, oh

I can't wait till I get home so you can tear that cherry out
(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)
I want you to (turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)

I’ve been drinking, I’ve been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I’ve been thinking, I’ve been thinking
Why can’t I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na, na
Why can’t I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na,na (drunk in love)

We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

Then I fill the tub up half way
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood
Graining, graining on that wood
I’m swerving on that, swerving
Swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve
Surfing all of this good, good

Say, we be all night
Love (sing along)
We be all night (sing it)
Love (yeah, MTV)

Let me sit this ass
On you
Show you how I feel
Let me take this off
Will you watch me?
Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes
Don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like
You can touch me, baby
Do you
Do you wanna touch me, baby?

You rock hard, I rock steady
You rock hard, I rock steady
You rock hard, I rock steady
Rock

Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don’t need you seeing, "’Yoncé, on her knees"
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain’t even gonna make it to this club

Oh, dere daddy daddy, didn’t bring a towel
Oh, baby, baby, better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain’t even gonna make it to this club

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
(Girl you like)
The kinda girl you like
(Girl you like)
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
(Girl you like)

We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls, "You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful but not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man"
Feminist, a person who believes in the social
Political and economic equality of the sexes

I'm having such a good time with y'all
Y'all sing with me

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches (crown)

Bow down, bitches
Bow, bow down, bitches (crown)
Bow down, bitches
Bow, bow down, bitches (crown)

H-town vicious, H-h-town vicious
I'm so crown, crown, bow down bitches

I'm out that H-town coming, coming down
I'm coming down
H-h-town-town I'm coming down, co-co-coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground

I said, how did you wake up this morning?

You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin round in that, flawless
Flossing on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My rock, flawless

I woke up like this
I woke up like this
If you're flawless, ladies and gentlemen, sing
I look so good tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn

Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator (haha)
(God damn, God damn, God damn)

Drop the bass man the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up," I just go slower
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
’Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

’Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
’Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
’Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor

Sometimes, these walls seem to cave in on me
But when I look in your eyes, I feel alive

Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
Blue

Hold on to me, hold on! (Blue)
Mommy, mommy, mommy!
Won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, Blue?

This next song is for all of my incredible fans
If it wasn't for you guys, I would not be here on this stage
I'm gonna sing and y'all repeat after me, ready?

Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
So, baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night, I'll
(In the darkest night, I'll)
I'll search through the crowd
(I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I wanna give you everything
Baby, love me lights out

Everybody on your feet, everybody on your feet, sing
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now put your hands together
Say, you love me like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me, boy, XO
You love me like XO

All I ever see
I'm gonna give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Thank you so much! I love y'all!
