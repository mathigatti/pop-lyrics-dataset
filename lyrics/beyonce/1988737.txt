And you need to know


A woman
She needs more than material things
A woman
Needs so much more than what I make her say

Oh, a real woman needs a real man

Put that work, and still shows his woman real romance

Make your way home
Outta days and hours, everynight
Keep up your fund
Just to say you'll still let love from time to time
Remind her, that she's still beautiful in you eyes
And ride with your woman
Make her feel that you're always on her side
When she cries
Ask her what she's feeling
Let her know you sympathize
Gotta swallow your pride
That's how make it up yo you, gotta make it right
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Got to take your time
I say, Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Say it one more time, Say it one more time
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Got to take your time
Don't no want minute man
We wanna have fun until she finish man
But that's asking too much
You never know how to be
