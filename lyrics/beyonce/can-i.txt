Is it alright if I want to fall way
Way deep in love with you?
Would it be safe to say that I'm well on my way?
I'm scared as hell yeah
Know heartbreak oh too well yeah,
Just give me a green light baby


To say it's ok to go in, go in, go in,
Baby can I, yeah, baby can I, yeah
Baby can I, yeah, baby can I, can
I tear these damn walls down now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Can I tear these damn walls down now
Yeah yeah yeah, can I tear these damn walls down now?

I miss you do you miss us?
It's so much shit we gotta discuss
When you think about me do you get stuck?
Cause when I think about you everything just
Reminds me of when we had our first christmas
And I been thinking we should talk about mistrust
Cause it cuts and that hurts
If I could I would play it all backwards
If you say it then you can't take back words

My head pounds my back hurts
When your going no one ever really knows
But when your gone and you feeling really cold
Would that do exactly?
The same thoughts just keep coming at me
You attract me,
Would that be I'm not happy

Love is danger,
I never thought that I would share it with a stranger,
On a mission really thinking I could change up
And if I did was I ready for the change up
Would you listen to what she said and remain calm
But baby you left me filled with my anger
Mistake,
Went the wrong way

I'm preparing just to have another long day
Without you I go in
I get mad I throw things,
Temper tantrums I want you
We can do it all again and I want to what
Would that do exactly?
The same thoughts just keep coming at me
You attract me would that be
I'm not happy

I built these walls up they been here to protect me
Saying you're all I need now
I'm thinking bout you crazy
Cause the last time that I did this,
Damn near lost my mind
I can say that I can do this but really can I
Is it alright if I want to fall way

Way deep in love with you?
Would it be safe to say that I'm well on my way?
I'm scared as hell yeah,
Know heartbreak oh too well yeah,
Just give me a green light baby
To say it's ok to go in, go in, go in
