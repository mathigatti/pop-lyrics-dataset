Babe
Gotta to know one thing before you ask my name
Be straight up and tell me whats your aim
A girl like me see I dont play no games, no no
That's why I say
If you wanna be with me go all the way
Do what you got to do, just let me state
Is it real or is this just a fake, tell me


Whats good with you baby (wanna get to know me)
Whats really good baby (do you have a lady)
Been near the hood lately (where you from and where you be)
Whats good with you baby (whats you good with you baby)

Babe
You sittin over there tryna figure out what to say
Make up your mind right now dont contemplate
You know that I don't have time to waste, no noo!
Where do we go
What this thing could be we'll never know
There is just no way that we can flow
If you aint being honest from the go, tell me

Whats good with you baby (wanna get to know me)
Whats really good baby (do you have a lady)
Been near the hood lately (where you from and where you be)
Whats good with you baby (whats you good with you baby)

Don't try playin with my mind

For something that I know aint good for me
Don't hesitate to say

Wanna know should I take a chance with you
