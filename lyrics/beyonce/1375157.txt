This is just another day
That I would spend waitin' for the right one
Staring at the night and wishin'
I could be the one to feel the warm sun
Your a dream but I'm wide awake
I'm in Heaven for heaven sakes
So get ready
(Get ready)
I'm ready now
(Get ready)
I could never need you more than now


You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
Ooo down to your type
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime

Tell me that your living in a place
Where no one else can find you
Tell me that your sanging out my name
Hoping that I'll hear you
Tell me "no" and I'll fade away
But this is lovin' that I won`t waste

So get ready
(Get ready)
I'm ready now
(Get ready)
I could never need you more than now

You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
Ooo down to your type
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime

What are the words I'm needin' to hear
How do I know if I'll ever love again
Seeing your face makes everything clear
(clear) Clear
And I will never be the same

You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
Ooo down to your type
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
