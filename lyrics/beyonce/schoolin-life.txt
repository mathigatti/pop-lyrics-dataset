This is for them twenty-somethin's
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them thirty-somethin'
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them forty-somethin'
Well, raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker
This is for them fifty-somethin'
Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head


Mom and dad tried to hide the world
Said the world's just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?
I had my first heels by the age of thirteen
Mom and dad tried to hide the boys
I swear that just made them want me more
At fourteen, they asked what I wanna be
I said: Baby, twenty-one, so I get me a drink

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor
But I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters

I'm a freak all day, a-a-all night
Ooh, hot, top, flight
Boy, out of sight
And I’m crazy all day, a-a-all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

Schoolin’ life
Schoolin’ life

This is for them pretty somethin's
Living in a fastlane, see you when you crash, babe
This is for them sexy somethin's
That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything
This is for them bitter somethin's
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet
And this is for them chipper somethin's
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor
But I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters

I'm a freak all day, a-a-all night
Ooh, hot, top, flight
Boy, out of sight
And I’m crazy all day, a-a-all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

Schoolin’ life
Schoolin’ life

You know it costs to be the boss
One day you'll run the town
For now make your life what you decide
Baby, party 'till the fire marshalls shut this sucker down

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor
But I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters

I'm a freak all day, a-a-all night
Ooh, hot, top, flight
Boy, out of sight
And I’m crazy all day, a-a-all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

There's not a real way to live this, for real
Just remember, stay the realest, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Don't stop running until it's finished, yeah, yeah
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten, hey, hey, hey
