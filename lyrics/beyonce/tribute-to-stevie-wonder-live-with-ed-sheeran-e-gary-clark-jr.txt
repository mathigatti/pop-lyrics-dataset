Everyone’s feeling pretty
It’s hotter than july
Though the world’s full of problems
They couldn’t touch us even if they tried

From the park I hear rhythms
Marley’s hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn’t know you
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin’ and jammin’ and jammin’, jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip way

Peace has come to zimbabwe
Third world’s right on the one
Now’s the time for celebration
‘Cause we’ve only just begun
Didn’t know you
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn
Didn’t know you
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn
Would be jammin’ and jammin’ and jammin’
Would be jammin’ and jammin’ and jammin’, jam on

People keep on learnin’
Soldiers keep on warrin’

World

Keep on turnin’
‘Cause it won’t to be too long

Powers keep on lyin’
While your people keep on dyin’
World keep on turnin’
‘Cause it won’t be too long

I’m so darn glad he let me try it again
‘Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I’m so glad that I know more than I knew then
Keep on tryin’ till I reach my highest ground

I’m so darn glad he let me try it again
‘Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I’m so glad that I know more than I knew then
Keep on tryin’ till I reach my highest ground

C’mon, c’mon, c’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon, c’mon, c’mon
