I remember being young and so brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me I'm a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now bitches I run this


'Cause I put it down like that, down like that
And I'm making all these racks, all these racks
And I'm moving round like that, round like that
When I do it I don't look back, don't look back

I'm a grown woman (eh, eh)
I can do whatever I want (eh, eh)
I'm a grown woman (eh, eh)
I can do whatever I want (eh, eh)

They love the way I walk
'Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk
'Cause I ain't pretending
It took a while, now I understand
Just where I'm going
I know the world and I know who I am
It's 'bout time I show it

I'm a grown woman (eh, eh)
I can do whatever I want (eh, eh)
I'm a grown woman (eh, eh)
I can do whatever I want (eh, eh)

I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long

I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want (whatever it is)

I'm a grown woman
And I know that I got it (got it got it)
I'm a grown woman
Ain't got no room in my pockets
I'm a grown woman
Look down, got you so excited
I really want to know if you got it like that
Cause I got a cute face and that booty so fat

Go girl, she got that bomb, that bomb
That girl can get whatever she wants
That girl (hey girl)
She got that tight, that tight
Them boys they do whatever she like

(I'm a grown woman)

(I'm a grown)

I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want)
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown

I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want (ever I want)
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want (ever I want)
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want (ever I want)
