OMG, you done lost yo' motherf*cking mind!

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
They told me 'bout all the lies
I took you back all those times


You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (it wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find?
You must've just lost yo mind

I could shed so many tears
But I won't let you see me crying
Now it all adds up, even the numbers
Let me exactly hear, but you you wonder
I know how my mama felt getting ran over
But this ain't a cycle here, this one is over

Something told me to check my time
If I'm the one that's always crying
Now that it's over, I can move on from here
Glad that it's over, so glad that it's over
I could've told ya it's all in the atmosphere
I can't control ya, but I'm not a pushover no more

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
They told me 'bout all the lies
I took you back all those times

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (it wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find?
You must've just lost yo mind

You could shed so many tears
But you won't let me see you crying
If she really loves ya than that's what ya need to build
I'm more than yo woman, I know you don't love her
I painted it for ya, but you picked the colors
At night you'll get over, yeah, like you will never

I trusted you through all these years
And I'm the one that's always crying
Now that it's over, I can move on from here
Glad that it's over, so glad that it's over
The melody told ya exactly the pain I feel
Reap what you sow, boy, I'm not a pushover

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
They told me 'bout all the lies
I took you back all those times

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (it wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find?
You must've just lost yo mind

I always knew you were counterfeit
That's what you get, I see you crying
Excuses after excuses
Pretending that we exclusive
I stuck around all these years
I dried and cried all your tears

I trusted you despite my fears
And I refuse to keep on trying
Now that it's over, I can move over
Glad that it's over, so glad that it's over
You just confirmed it, this ain't a warning
Been living a double life, you must have lost yo mind

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (you crazy)
You must've just lost yo mind (you crazy)
They told me 'bout all the lies (you lost yo mind)
I took you back all those times (tell ya one more time)
You must have lost yo mind (you lost yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (it was not mine)
Many earrings must I find? (hey)
You must've just lost yo mind

You just lost yo mind
