(Call Becky with the good hair)
Coachella, thank y'all so much for having us once again
I'm so honored to be on this stage tonight
And this next song is for all of my queens
Do we have any beautiful queens in the house tonight?
I want y'all to sing along if you know the lyrics
It's called Bow Down


I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of bein' in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches

Bow down bitches, bow-bow down bitches (hey)
(Bow down down, bow-bow bow down)
(Bow down down, bow-bow bow down)
(Bow down down, bow-bow bow down)
(I'm so crown, crown, bow down, hey)
H-Town

I'm out that H-Town
Comin', comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
(Comin' up)
H, H-town-town, I'm comin' down
(Comin' down)
Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
