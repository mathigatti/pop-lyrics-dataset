Who the fuck do you think I is?
You ain't married to no average bitch, boy
You can watch this fat ass twist, boy
As I bounce to the next dick, boy
And keep your money, I got my own
Keep a bigger smile on my face being alone
Bad motherfucker, God complex
I'll motivate your ass, call me Malcolm X
Your operator, innovator
Fuck you, hater, you can't recreate her, no, haha
You'll never recreate her, no, hell no, uh


You just gotta let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, baby, oh
You just gotta let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, baby

You hurt yourself
Don't hurt yourself
When you play me, you play yourself
Don't play yourself
When you lie to me, you lie to yourself
You're only lying to yourself
When you hurt me, you hurt yourself
Don't hurt yourself

You just gotta let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, baby
Hey baby

Who the fuck do you think I is?
I smell that fragrance on your Louis knit, boy
Just give this fat ass a big kiss, boy
Tonight, I'm fucking up all your shit, boy

(The most disrespected person in America is the black woman)
I am the dragon breathing fire
(The most unprotected person in America is the black woman)
Beautiful mane, I'm the lion
(The most neglected person in America is the black woman)
Beautiful man, I know you're lying

This is your final warning (don't hurt yourself)
You know I give you life (don't hurt yourself)
If you try this shit again (don't hurt yourself)
You gon' lose your wife
