Paparazzi spots me
In the lobby
Of my high-rise
I hide
Behind my shades
Cause the fame is blinding my eyes
My God
I know how Ozzie Oz
Once had felt when he was as high
As I have got
I have got
To make this stop
People often warn me
That the fame ain't for the vain if heart
It'll change those
Who they had love for you
Into strangers
When your fame starts
It's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when the train departs
Stranger
Things have happened
Rapping
Stacking
Platinum plaquin'
Born in Brooklyn got a place in Manhattan
Going back to Brooklyn
To escape the madness
When your friends is
Chris and Gwyneth
When your girl is more famous
Then you then is
Time to get all your windows tinted
Keep your eyes squinted
It's gon' flash any minute
The music biz is like musical chairs
Its about where you standing when the music stop spinning
In a
