Hey honey
Cat got your tongue
Don't look so funny?
Mister Comedian
Joke's on you
And you're good at bets
So where's my money


i know you bet
And i would never make that move

so why's the house empty
light's off by the end of this week
I'll leave with what i came with baby
I'll take dogs, you keep the Mercedes

cause i'm gone i'm not staying
I'll walk these roads with grace
And i'll wave with you behind me
With a new smile on my face

Cause i'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
when i walk in the room every head turns
every eye is on me
too bad you're not here to see it
and by the time you get this
I'll be so long gone and far
i'll send you a postcard
aha I'll send you a postcard

hey baby
you seem to ghost this ain't yo lady
this is the chick that you held back now
now all of the things you've said were crazy
i checked out my list and i feel good about it
i got the new haircut
the one that you said that wouldnt look no good
took that job you said i could not get
wore that dress you said i'd never fit

cause you're gone and i'm great
i got rid of your dead way
and ill wave at you behind me
With a new smile on my face
cause i'm walking in new shoes now
i got a new song to sing
when i walk in the room every head turns
every eye is on me
to bad you're not here to see it
and by the time you get this
i was so long gone and far
i'll send you a postcard
