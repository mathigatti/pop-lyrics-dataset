Go out tonight
Nice night
Stay out all night, like is 1996
Pull out that porsche tonight


Front withcha boys tonight
Lay out the bar tonight
You deserve baby talk your shit

I know you never lie to me
And you've  always be faithful
And I know there ain`t any other guys like you
That's why I try to feel your happiness
Oh yes oh yes oh yes

I, I need my man
To feel like he's the man
For fill the need for questioning where he is or who he's with
More than my man, he's my best friend
For fill the need for checking him,

Cus we got blind trust, trust, trust, trust
We got blind trust, trust, trust
Cus we got blind trust.
