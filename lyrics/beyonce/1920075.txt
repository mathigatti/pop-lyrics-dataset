Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching (they're watching)
All the commotion
The kiddie-like play
Has people talking (talking)


You...
Your Sex is on fire

The dark of the alley
The breaking of the day
The head while I'm driving (I'm driving)
Soft lips are open
Them nuckles are pale
Feels like I'm dying (you're dying)

You...
Your sex is on fire
Consumed with the words you transpire

Hot as a fever
Rattling bones
I could just taste it (taste it)
If it's not forever
If it's just tonight
Oh, it still the greatest (the greatest, the greatest)

You...
Your sex is on fire...

You...
Your sex is on fire
Consumed with the words you transpire (2x)
