Ten times out of nine, I know you‘re lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you’re trying
So I’m trying to be fair
And you’re trying to be there, and to care
And you’re caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I’ve been giving goes unnoticed
It’s just floating in the air
Look it there, are you aware?


You’re my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn’t me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day?
Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don’t care about the lights or the beams
I’d spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up
Skin thick, too tough

‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could move a mountain
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could calm a war down
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could make it rain now
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could stop this love drought

Nine times out of ten, I’m in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I’m only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I’m movin’ on
I’ve always been committed, I’ve been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad

But you’re my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn’t B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day?
Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don’t care about the lights or the beams
I’d spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up
Them old bitches so wack, I’m so tough
Wassup?

‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could move a mountain
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could calm a war down
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could make it rain now
And you, you, you
You and me would stop this love drought

‘Cause you, you, you
You and me would stop this love drought
