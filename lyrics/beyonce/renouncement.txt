Then Sun will die
I'll come to rule.
Then you can lie
And think it's true
No war, no peace
Just only Hell!
And you, young priest
Will earn dark spell


Don't you so tired
In cage of Life?
Feel smell of freedom
With Evil sign
You wrong, if you think
You're lead by God
The Prophesy can't fails me
It's in your heart

Sleep well, my little king,
I'll come in to your dream.
You'll see the plan of mine,
Dark Prince, wait for my sign
And now, my son,
Let's break the rules

Kill faith inside,
Renounce with fools
Unchain your mind,
It's your last dream
Get my last sign,
Dark reign, begin!
