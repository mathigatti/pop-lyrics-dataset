You're holding me
and I close my eyes,
you're whispering
and I start to cry,
you feel so good,
you're so beautiful,
for as long as you live don't let me go,


Just hold me,
Touch me,
Feel me.
As long as you love me,
reach for me,
and need me.
If you could trust me,
and teach me,
never let go of me.
Because you're half of me my heart still beats.

Looking in the eyes,
the eyes of love,
and I hold your face
and I see the sun,
and I taste your kiss,
and you touch my soul,
and I'm feeling things I never felt before,

Just hold me,
touch me,
feel me.
As long as you love me,
reach for me,
and need me.
If you could trust me,
and teach me,
never let go of me.
Because you're half of me my heart still beats.

I am feeling,
what they call pure love,
I never knew feeling like this could excist inside of me,
I'm soaring,
emotions exploding,
I don't wanna live another day with tou not here with me,

Just hold me,
touch me,
feel me.
As long as you love me,
reach for me,
and need me.
If you could trust me,
teach me,
never let go of me.
Because you're half of me my heart still beats...
Oh, oh, my heart still beats...
