[Beyoncé]
Hit me!


[Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams &amp; Beyoncé]
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (Hah, hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath

If you can't make me say ooh
Like the beat of this drum
Why you ask for some?
You ain't really want none
If you can't make me say ooh
Like the beat of this groove
You don't have no business in this
Here's your papers, baby, you are dismissed

Everybody give it up for the beautiful Kelly, and the beautiful Michelle
We love you
My girl Bey is killin' it tonight
I'm so happy y'all are here tonight
Do y'all remember this song?
