I'm so in love
I'm still in love
I never met love quite before
Until I saw your face
And watching stars without you
My soul cries
My hething heart
Is full of pain
When we're apart
Be aching
I'm kissing you
Oh
I'm kissing you oh
You're my father, you're my soldier
You protect me
Boy you save me
You're best friend
You're my husband
You are my doctor, counselor, provider, professor, my everything
And I love you, I love you, I love you, yes, I love you


I, I need you, I need you, I need you
I can't live without you
I trust you, I trust you with every ounce of me
Just teach me boy teach me just take me
When we make love I can feel all your spirit
Deep inside of me, yea
Baby, you're so pure, oh
I'm kissing you forever and ever and ever
I love kissing you, kissing you, kissing you
I love everything about you, baby
It's been so many years since we fell in love
You got something special, baby
We can cry together
We can grow together
Be ourselves togeteher
And I love you
More than music
Yes I love you more than music
I rather be kissing you, oh
I'm kissing you, oh
Kissing you
Kissing you
