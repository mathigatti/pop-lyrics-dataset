Sometimes, these walls seem to cave in on me
But when I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days, we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you're holding me tight, I feel alive


Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
Blue

Each day, I feel so blessed to be looking at you
Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive
Now let's just live it up

Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
Blue

Baby, last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me

We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You've got to hold on
You've got a hold on, a hold on to me

We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You've got to hold on,
You've got to a hold on, a hold on to me

Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, Blue

Hold on to me, hold on
Been-sy-ay
Been-sy-ay
Blue
Mommy, mommy, mommy
Can we see daddy
Can we see daddy
Missus Carter!
Missus Carter!
