Child of the wilderness
Born into emptiness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way in darkness


Who will be there for you
Comfort and care for you
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion

Never dreamed that out in the world
There are arms to hold you
You've always known
Your heart was on it's own

So laugh in your loneliness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to love life that is lived alone

Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion
Never dreamed that out in the world
There are arms to hold you
You've always known
Your heart was on it's own

So laugh in your loneliness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to be lonely
Learn how to love life that is lived alone
