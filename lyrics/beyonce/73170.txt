I remember when you use to take me
On a bike ride everyday on the bayou
(You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You'd come home from work
And I jumped in your arms when I saw you
(I was so excited)
I was so happy to see you
(So happy to see you)


Because you loved me I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory

And that's why
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date
And had a boyfriend (My first boyfriend, you should have seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo
Could have said "Beyonc√©, I told you so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even mama said y'all would get one just like mine)

Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory

That's why
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky, know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming

Can't stop my tears from falling
I love you so much daddy

My unborn son to be like my daddy (thank you, you've done so much for me)
I want my husband to be like my daddy (I love you daddy)
There is no one else like my daddy (I get so emotional daddy, everytime I think of you)
And I thank you for loving me (I get so emotional daddy, everytime I think of you)

There is no one else like my daddy
No one else can replace my daddy
