Uh, uh-huh 
Amil-lion, yeah Roc-a-fella 
(Oh, oh yeah) 
What? Huh, uh-huh 
(Oh) 
Yea-yeah, yeah, I got that 
Uh-huh, yo, yo 


I make cats pay like lay-way 
Own like they stole 
Deal with late pay and I got that from Hawk 
Plus I got my own bread 
You ain't gotta wave them over my head 
I got that 
(I got that) 
And you can't leave me stranded 
Cause I got a ride back 
And besides that 
What chick you know cock glocks back? 
Eight in the back, they rockin' hot jacks 
In high heels, mini skirts and thighs fat 
My styles like the international 
Pancake house or whatever avenue 
I got that, uh I got that 

1 - [Beyonce'] 
Think I need you cause the rent is due 
You can be outta here baby 
Cause I got it 
I got it, I got it 
Cause cash, coupes, credit cards 
All the exotic things baby 
I got it 
I got it, I got it 

[Amil] 
Ever since cats found out I ran with the Roc 
They wanna take a closer look, wanna examine the box 
Magazine want cameras to pop 
They catch me in the nude like a Samantha Fox 
Listen dude but I got dollars and cents 
You don't gotta promise me to pay my rent 
I got that 
(I got that) 
Catch me a drop black playing Speedy Gonzalez 
Toes never unpolished 
The way I be dressing dudes wanna toss the salad 
The way I be dressing got broads acting childish 
But I pay my own bills 
Amil-lion always has and always will 
Y'all got that? 

Repeat 1 

[Beyonce'] 
I got that 
The house that you live in 
I got that 
The bed that you sleep in 
I got that 
The Benz that you're driving 
I got that, I got that 
I got that 
The ice that you're wearing 
I got that 
So why you complaining 
I got that 
Who you gaming? 
I got that, I got that 
I got that 

[Amil] 
Yo my life's still on 
Gas bill caught up 
Indian Amil, call me chief running water 
Cable still in order 
Phone still dials out 
Money still long but my patience got shorter 
You can leave baby give me everything I bought you 
Like you leaving me was some type of torture 
I don't need no man to 
Do for Amil what Amil can do 
You got that? 

Repeat 1 (2x) 

[Amil] 
That's right baby 
Amil-lion, uh 
I got this what?
