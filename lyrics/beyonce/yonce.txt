See me up in the club with fifty of them girls
Posted in the back, got my things in my grill
Brooklyn brim, with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on instagram cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G’s up, tell me how I’m looking baby


Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it’s looking baby
Just tell me how it’s looking baby
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
Tell me how it’s looking baby (how it’s looking baby)
Tell me how it’s looking baby, looking baby

Drop the bass man the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up," I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
The man ain’t ever seen a booty like this

Why do you think
You keep up my name rolling off the tongue
Cause when you wanna smash
I just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

’Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
’Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
’Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
’Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor like like like liquor

’Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
’Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
’Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor, like like like liquor
