I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that means something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget


I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done
Everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

I want to say I lived each day until I die
And know that I had something in somebody's life
The hearts that I have touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done
Everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done
Everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone some happiness
Left this world a little better just because
I was here

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done
Everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

I lived (I lived!), I loved
I was here
I did (I did!), I've done
I was here
I lived (I lived!), I loved (I loved!)
I was here
I did, I've done
I was here
