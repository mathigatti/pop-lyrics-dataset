Baby, put your arms around me, tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and thought you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble but I know that's why you're staying


Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

No, I'm not an angel either but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you're late or when you're lying?
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

Uh oh uh
Uh oh uh
Uh oh uh

Tell me, do you wanna ride?
(Ride, ride, ride, ride)
Tell me, do you wanna ride?

Ride around
Ride around
Ride around
You ride around in that H-Town
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop actin' so scared, just do what I tell
First both of my legs, go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah, baby, I bet it comes true

Baby, put your arms around me, tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and thought you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble but I know that's why you're staying

Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

You're no angel either, baby

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
