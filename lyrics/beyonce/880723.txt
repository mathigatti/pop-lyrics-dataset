I wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me. and It came so effortlessly. after I finished the film of my life dream girls because I was so inspired by Dina I wrote songs that were saying all the things that 
I wish she would have said in the film. and I wanted to give you an extra special song that Dina sings it's a pivotal moment when Dina finally does, get the strength to stand up for herself and does, know who she is and knows what she wants. 
Im sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics. 
This is, listen.
