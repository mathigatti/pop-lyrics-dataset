Rah, rah, rah
Sing it, y'all


Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
Sing it, y'all

My baby is a ten
We dressing to the nine
He pick me up, we eight
Make me feel so lucky, seven
He kiss me in his six
We be making love in five (I see you)
Still the one I do this four
I'm trying to make us three
From that two
He still the one

There's ups and downs in this love
Got a lot to learn in this love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love, hey
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain

Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the flyest
Grind up on it, girl, girl, girl (show him how you ride it)
Me and my boo in the coupe lip locking
All up in the back 'cause the chicks keep flocking
All that gossip in 10 years, stop it
London, speed it up, Houston, rock it
