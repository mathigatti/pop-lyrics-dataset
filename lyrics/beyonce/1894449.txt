If I ain't got nothing
I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know
One plus one equals two
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through


'Cause baby, we ain't got nothing without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby

Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all
Right now, baby
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
Oh, make love to me

Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I
I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die but I hope
That I'm gon' die by you, hey
I don't know much about fighting but I
I know I will fight for you, hey
Just when I ball up my fist I realize
I'm lying right next to you

Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us, ooh

Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all
Help me let down my guard
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
Oh, make love to me, me, me, me, me
