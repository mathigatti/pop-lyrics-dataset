All my life
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you


All my life
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you

Stop asking so many questions now
I slip on your slip but
Got a long way to go
You got a long, long way to go
I sleep on the floor boards, I kiss the ground
My heart is a stone
I got a long way to go
I got a long, long way to go

Baby all my life
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you

All my life
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you

Yeah I know the problems I’m left with
See I know the leaves were our first gifts
I know how I hurt you
I'm certain my tongue sets on fire, a furnace
Yeah we'll always find a way
And we'll always find a way
A way a way a way
To wake up
A way a way a way

All my life
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you

All my life
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you

‘Cause baby we got a lot of life to live
You’re the only one that I could stand by
And baby we've got a lot of love to give
Maybe we can put the whole world on stand by

All my life
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you

All my life
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you

All my life
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you

All my life
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
I’ve been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you
