Let me hear you sing

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry


He trying to roll me up (I ain't sorry)
I ain't picking up (I ain't sorry)
I'm headed to the club (I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you (I ain't sorry)
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÃ‰ cup (I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry)
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause

Bug a boos, I need a good laugh
You, make me laugh
(Bug a boos)

Did that make us laugh?
Think about it
(Bug a boos)

Fall in line
Ladies, ladies, ladies
Are we smart? (Yes)
Are we strong? (Yes)
Have we had enough of the bullshit? (Yes)
Show 'em

Suck
On my balls
Suck on my balls
Suck on my balls, bitch
Suck
On my balls
Suck on my balls, balls
Hell nah
Hell nah

Middle fingers up (middle fingers up)
Put them hands high (put them hands high)
Wave it in his face (wave it, wave it in his face)
Tell him: Boy, bye! (Tell him, tell him: Boy, bye)
Let's go
Tell him: Boy, bye! Tell him, tell him: Boy, bye!
Tell him: Boy, bye! Tell him, tell him: Boy, bye!
Tell him: Boy, bye! Tell him, tell him: Boy, bye!
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him: Boy, bye
Tell him: Boy, bye, boy, bye
Middle fingers up, I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah

Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Foolish of me to dream while you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got

Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
(I see you, how did you do that so fast? She has on my outfit, y'all)
Sing it
(Me, myself, and I) sing it
(That's all I got in the end)
(That's what I found out) found out
(And it ain't no need to cry) sing it ladies
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend

Right, ladies? Yes

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my woadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair
