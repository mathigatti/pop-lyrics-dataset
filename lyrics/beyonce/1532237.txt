You're bad for me, I clearly get it
I don't see how something good
Could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss
You're snatching every bit of strength


That I'm gon' need
To fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart-breaking situation
I'm up in but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right, take me high
Then that high, it subsides
And my body flatlines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I'm alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?

How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis? Will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin
That broke my heart down, baby?

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

It's just not my body
It's my mind, you don't know how many times
I told myself this can't do
And that I don't need you
(No, I don't need you, no)
It's so unfair
That I find myself right back in your care
And what's good is that when you're not always there
You're no good for my health, my health

You're just like poison
Whoa, whoa, whoa
You're just like poison
Whoa, whoa, whoa

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Baby, kiss me one more time

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't wanna do
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
