Check this out, after Beyoncé perform
After she done the dance
Coachella gotta rename Coachella to Beychella
New name alert: Beychella
If y'all know this one I want y'all to sing along
And bop, and bop, bop
B, put the fuckboy on notice


[Beyoncé]
I'm the only lady here, still the realest nigga in the room
I break the internet, top two and I ain't number two
My body, my ice, my cash, all real, I'm a triple threat
Fuck it up and then leave, come back, fuck it up and leave again
Top off the coupe and it look like Freaknik
In the hood, hollerin', Free Meek
Two deep, it's just me and JAY
Just posted in them courtside seats
Woo! I'm like: Hol' up
Woo! I might roll up
They're tryna party with the queen
They gon' have to sign a non-disclosure

I took the top off the Maybach, yeah
