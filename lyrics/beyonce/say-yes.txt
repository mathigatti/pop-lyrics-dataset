I'm not worried 'bout a thing
'Cause I know you are guiding me
Where you lead me, lord, I will go
I have no fear 'cause I know who's in control

There's no limit to what you can do
'Cause it all belongs to you
Yes, it all belongs to you (no rushing now)
You're almighty and all powerful
And it all belongs to you
Yes, it all belongs to you
