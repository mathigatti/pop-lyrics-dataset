[Chorus]
If you leave her
I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hideaway
Oh, Just you and me


I peep game long time ago,
When he told me, he never seen a chick before
He wouldn't give me no explaination
Cause he knows when I pack my bags it ain't for no
vacation

I'm gonna do my thing,
I'm leaving his alone,
Oh I'm moving on my way
He's history, history
If he believe it's over, your'll see
A girl gotta do what she gotta do,
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
If you leave her
I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hideaway
Oh, Just you and me

(repeat chorus)

I call 612-555-2422
to find you
I packed my bag's,
Gased up the jag,
and tell my dad,
Your the finest girl I ever had,

Can't tell my lady,
that a mess up page maine,
I know it might sound crazy,
but say your'll be my baby
She crushed my new benz
Slept with my best friend,
Spend all my ends,
It's got to end

[Beyonce]
Oh, how do I know
you won't hurt me,
Like he has,
I know you say you want me bad

[RL]
You gotta have faith in me,

[Beyonce]
You know I do,

[RL]
To make everything, baby
Cuz my love, it's alright its all you'll ever need

[Beyonce]
Cause I need someone for me,

[RL]
This love was meant to be

[Beyonce]
It's our destiny

[Both Together]
Just run away with me, Oh ho

[Chorus]
If you leave her
I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hideaway
Oh, Just you and me

(repeat chorus till fade out)
