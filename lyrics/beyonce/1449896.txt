If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go


Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If you were a boy
Then girl you'd understand
You need to stop listening to your friends
Love, respect and trust your man
So I go to clubs with the guys
And sometimes flirt with the girls
I should be able to roll out
As long as I'm coming home to you
And give you the world

But you are not a boy
So you dont have a clue (ey)
How I work and pay the bills
Girl, and everything I do is for you (eh eh)
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
(If I were a girl)
I would turn off my phone
(I wouldn't play games)
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
(Girl, you know that's wrong)
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'll be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home

But you are not a boy
So you can't understand
You are not a perfect woman
And I am not a perfect man (remix, remix)
I'd listen to her (eh eh)
'Cause I know how it hurts (and I know how you feel)
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

Said I'm sorry
It's a little too late for you to come back
But I cant let you go
'Cause I'm too attached
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
