I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with his same old safe bet
You and your head high
And your tears dry, get on without your guy
I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And you tread a troubled track
Your odds are stacked, you'll go back to black


We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
I go back to her
And you go back to
You go back to

I love you much
It's not enough, I love blow and you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
I go back to black
