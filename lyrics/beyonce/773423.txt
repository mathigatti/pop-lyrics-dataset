While we grind to the beat
And your body's
Touchin' me

Baby, all I need

Boy, dance with me
Feel my body
Don't stop, just come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body's

All I'm thinking's bodies gettin' bodied
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine
I swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Come here, boy, let me work on you
