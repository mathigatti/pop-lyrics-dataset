Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not?


Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music is for the sad men

Sing!

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and never
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young

So we livin' life like a video
Where the sun is always out
And you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by on the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up
On the hood of that pretty ass car
WIthout in a wrinkle in today
Because there is no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that lasts a whole lifetime
And it never ends because all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's stay in the moment
Smoke some week, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase
Neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and never
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, or never

Fear not when, fear not why
Fear not much while were alive
Life is for living not living up tight
See ya somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down
To generations while debating up in barber shops
Young slung, hung here
Show that the n-gga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, thats how you let me know, baby

Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

Slamming Bentley doors
Hopping out of Porsches
Popping up on Forbes lists
Gorgeous
Hold up
N-ggas starting law suits
They be talking bullsh-t
I be talking more sh-t
They nauseous
Hold up
I'll be here forever
You know, I'm on my fall sh-t
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars
Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet
I'm painting you a portrait of young?
