[Ghostface Killah - talking]
Yeah .. uh huh
What up girl, yeah
I hear all that
That's real nice and all that
It's been, it been good though
Cause it's been a year
It been real good
Cause it been so good
In the summertime all over again
Tell me somethin


[Beyonce]
Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

[Break - Beyonce - w/ ad libs]
I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to
Someone who'll really listen
When you touched my hand
The sun got brighter then
Trusting you I close my eyes
And felt our love begin

[Chorus - Beyonce]
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime

[Beyonce]
Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now, you are my prize
Wanna grow old with ya
Fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you
A little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

[Break - w/ ad libs]

[Ghostface Killah - talking behind Break]
I wanna understand everything you talk about baby
That's my word, cause I feel the same way
You know what I mean?
I've been feelin this way for a long time too
And a .. it's like I wanna be a daddy
I wanna be your lover
Your everything, I just wanna share life with you
Just like yo
That's why I tell you I love you

[Ghostface Killah]
I use to sit back and analyze on how we first met
A year ago on the barbershop steps
You and your friends walked past me
I called you back like "come here sexy have a word with you yet,
please?"
Congratulations on bein my gift
God wrapped you up tight and he preserved my wish
I'm not a psychic it's just that I'm in tune with such
I swear the vibes got heavy when we got real close
My whole demeanor caused me to ask questions and stare at you
strangely
Have I found my baby?
If so then tell me now
Look like you was 'bout to say somethin, you just broke a smile
Gave you the number and I said I'd dial (yeah)
A year later we on the block like "bow"
Tell me somethin, is it me or we up to somethin?
Love to love ya, your my friend and my woman

[Chorus]
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime

[Ghostface Killah - talking]
This is Theodore, that's right
I keep hearin this all in my head over and over
I can't get it out, it's crazy
You know what I'm sayin baby
This joint is real, I like that
Tell me somethin

[Chorus]
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime
