Give it to mama
Give it, give it
Give it to mama, mama
Give it
Give it to mama, mama


For some strange reason
You're done pleasin' me like it's okay
Like a perm that's been left too long
(It's starts to burn)
The result is it just won't take
(I can see)
Now, it's all coming so clear to me now
(I can see)
Misinterpreted all my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you than I can't do
My stock just went up over two million

So if you want to (uh, uh, huh, uh, uh)
You got the green light (uh, uh, huh, uh, uh)

Go, go, go, go, ooh
Go, go, go, go, ooh
Go, go, go, go, ooh
Go, go
Red light! Green light!

Some see me, say I should be trophied
'Cause it gets no stronger
Ladies, y'all know (yeah, girl, ya'll know)
This pimp *ish gets no older
Is that a threat? (what's another threat?)
Yep! (that's another threat)
I'm immune, you can get no colder
You got the green light, you the king, right?
You holdin' up traffic, green means go!

Go, go, go, go, ooh
Go, go, go, go, ooh
Go, go, go, go, ooh
Go, go
Red light! Green light!
(I said you're holdin' up traffic, green means go!)

(Go, go, go, go, ooh)
Ain't no problem, you can go
I will find somebody else
(Go, go, go, go, ooh)
It's alright, I'll move along
You got the green light so you can go
(Go, go, go, go, ooh)
Go, go
Red light! Green light

I gave all I could give
My love, my heart
Now we're facing the end
From what you did from the start, my love

You're holdin' up traffic, green means go!
