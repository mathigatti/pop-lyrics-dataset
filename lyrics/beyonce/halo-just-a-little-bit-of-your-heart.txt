I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to
Know who you're with


I can't even think straight but I can tell
You were just with her
And I'll still be a fool

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo

I don't ever tell you how I really feel
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light

And nothing's evert easy
That's what they say
I know I'm not your only
But I'll still be a fool

It's like I've been awakened (cause I'm a fool for you)
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo (just a little bit)
I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo

I know I'm not, you're only
But at least I'm one (halo)
I hear a little love is better than none (halo ooh)

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
