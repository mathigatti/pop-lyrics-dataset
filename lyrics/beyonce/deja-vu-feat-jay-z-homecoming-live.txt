Coachella, if you havin' a good time tonight, make some noise
Give it up for Hova


Come on
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag Bey, boy, you hurtin' that
Brooklyn Baby where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and Bey, she about to sting, stand back

Baby (yeah), seem like everywhere I go, I see you (yeah)
From your eyes your smile, it's like I breathe you (that's right)
Helplessly, I reminisce, don't want to (uh huh)
Compare nobody to you (take 'em uptown)

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control (take 'em uptown)
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go (let's go)

Know that I can't get over you (hey, uh)
'Cause everything I see is you (oh whoa, that's right)
And I don't want no substitute (that's right)
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu (come on)
Know that I can't get over you (uh huh)
'Cause everything I see is you (uh huh)
And I don't want no substitute (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu (yeah)

[Jay-Z]
Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl, you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gonna need the help tryna study my bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
It's a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my

[Beyoncé]
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true (yeah)
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having déjà vu?

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute (here we go)
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light
