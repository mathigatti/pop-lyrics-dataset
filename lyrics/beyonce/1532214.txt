I read all of the magazines
While waiting around
You said you couldn't wait to see me
But you got stuck in town
So turn off the phone
Now we're finally alone
It's the moments at the end of the day
Feel you touch and it's the sweetest
Your kisses are my weakness
I never want them to go away


[Chorus:]
I wanna feel you in my heart
As I look into your eyes
No need to get busy so let's take our time
And make slow love, slow love
And every minute that we have
It goes too fast
Wanna show you how to rock it so this feeling lasts
And make slow love, slow love
Slow love, slow love, slow love all night

[Verse 2:]
Just a few little things
That you've gotta know
A girl will give you all of her heart
When it's happening slow
I need a little laughter
And love will follow after
Let's take this chance to steal away
Your kisses are delicious
And no one is gonna miss us
Tonight I really want you to stay

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
So I'm calling out
Do you hear my cries
Don't have to say good-bye
You the breath on my skin
Cherish the taste
It's far too good to go to waste
Feel my desire
Make sweet love all through
All through the night
Make love through the night
