Let me sit this ass on you, show you how I feel
Let me take this off, will you watch me
Yes mass appeal
Don't take your eyes
Don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like, you can touch me baby
Do you, do you wanna touch me baby
Grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know, that you, ready
I just wanna show you now
Slow it down, go around
You rock hard
I rock steady


And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak baby peak baby peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep baby, your deep baby, deep
Then dip me under where
You can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me

Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel

Hard rock steady rock hard rock steady
Rock hard rock steady rock hard rock steady
