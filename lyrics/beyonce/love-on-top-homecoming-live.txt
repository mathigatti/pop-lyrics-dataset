I wanna sing this last song to all of my incredible, beautiful fans
Loyal fans, ride-or-dies
It's dedicate to my incredible Beyhive


Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
And I can feel the stars whenever you're near, you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away

Everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh-woah
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fightin' through my tears
But finally you put me first

Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, it's your turn, sing it, louder
You're the-
C-c-come on baby, it's-
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can-
When I need you, making everything-
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only thing I see
C-c-come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top

Coachella, thank you so much, I love you
