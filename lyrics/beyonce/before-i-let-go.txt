You make me happy
This you can bet, yeah
It’s clear right beside me, yeah
And I won’t forget


And I really love you
You should know
I wanna make sure I’m right, boy
Before I let go

Now, we had our good times
That we can say
We hurted each other, yeah
And, boy, it’s a shame

I won’t be foolish, no
I wanna know
I wanna make sure I’m bright, boy
Before I let go
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah

You know, I thank God sun rises and shines on you
You know there’s nothing, nothing, nothing I would not do, oh
Before I let you go, oh
I would never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Let you go before I go

I pull up to Coachella (pull up)
And boost with the ghost fellas (pull up)
I brought the squad with me (squad)
Black on black bandanas, I
Dussé and Champagne (champagne)
I did the damn thing (I did the damn thing)
Dirty Diana (dirty Diana)
Singing and dancing all in the rain
Ooh (to the left), I just wanna have a good time (turn around)
Turn around, kick then slide
And twirl that ass to the right, now
Ooh, bunny hop, bunny hop, drop, pop
Cross your legs, turn around and clap
Shuffle to the left, let’s glide now
Ooh, drop it down, drop it down low, low
Low, low, low to the floor, floor
Bring it up, clap, then roll, roll
Step on em, step on em, step on em, step
Step on em, kick on em, stomp then you step
Swag the right, surf the left
Work the middle till it hurt a little

Before I let, before I let, b-b-before I let go
Before I let, before I let, b-b-before I let go
