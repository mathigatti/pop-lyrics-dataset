You are alone, and I'd be a piss
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you bet all of you and wanted nothing else for me
But come back sometimes for you but else I met you was only


I couldn't see but now I know that I acted selfishly
I should of known that I let you down and caused you so much misery
And never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea

All of the times you used to cry
Because I would let you down
All of the times I should of tried a little more to be around
But I didn't know you were hurting I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain another you I'll never find
