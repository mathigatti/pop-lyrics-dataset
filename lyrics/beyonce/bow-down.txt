I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, donâ€™t forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches


I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches

Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches
H-town vicious, H-H-town vicious
I'm so crown, bow bow down bitches

I'm out that H-town
Coming, coming down
I'm coming down dripping candy on the ground
H, H-town, town, I'm coming down
Coming down dripping candy on the ground

Coming up, (coming up), coming down, (coming down)
Riding clean fix your hair in my Crown ,(in my Crown)
Bad bitch, (Bad bitch), H town (H town)
Keep it trill, y'all know y'all can't fuck around (fuck around)

Coming up, (coming up), coming down, (coming down)
Riding clean fix your hair in my Crown, (in my Crown)
Bad bitch, (Bad bitch), H town (H town)
Keep it trill, y'all know y'all can't fuck around (fuck around)
