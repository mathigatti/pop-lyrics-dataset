There ain't nothing
Like the real thing 
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing


There ain't nothing
Like the real thing 
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing

I see your picture
Hanging on the wall
But it can't sing 
Or come to me
When I call your name
I realize it's just
A picture in a frame

And I read your letters
When you're not here
They don't move me
They don't groove me
Like when I hear 
Your sweet voice
Whispering in my ear

There ain't nothing
Like the real thing 
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing

No other sound is quite 
The same as your name
No touch can do 
Half as much
To make me feel better

Let's stay together
Together, baby 
Together, yeah
Together, together

I got some memories 
To look back on
And though they help 
When you phone
I'm well aware 
Nothing takes
The place 
Of your being there

There ain't nothing
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing 
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing

(Not like the real thing)
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)

Oh, oh 
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing

The real, the real
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
The real, the real
The real thing

Oh, the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
(Not like the real thing)
