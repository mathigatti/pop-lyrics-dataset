Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say: Baby, I love you (sing it, y'all)
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say: Baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name


[Beyoncé]
Any other day, I would call, you would say
Baby, how's your day?
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is uh-huh, okay
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
Sing

(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's going down that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange)
Nobody's holding you back from me
('Cause I know how you usually do)
When you say everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there, then tell me who

(Say my name, say my name)
Boy, say my name
(If no one is around you, say: Baby)
I love you
(If you ain't runnin' game)
Say my name, say my
(Say my name, say my name)
Say my name
(You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby)
Oh yeah, sing
(Why the sudden change?)
(Say my name, say my name)
Say my name, say my name
Say my name
Say my, say my, say my name
Say my, say my, say my name
Boy, say my name
Hey, say

You better say my name
'Cause something feels strange
I’m filing a complaint
I’m just asking you to say my name
