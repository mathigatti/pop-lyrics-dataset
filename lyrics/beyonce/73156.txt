I'm checking on you, boo, do what you do
And while dance, I'm'ma glance at this beautiful view
To keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue 'em with glue
I'm in a trance, all eyes on you and your crew
Me and my mans don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind
It won't hurt if you gon' try one time
They all hot, but let me see this ones mine
It's Slim Thug and D.C. out of H-Town
