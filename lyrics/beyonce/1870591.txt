Some of them men think they freak this like we do
But, no, they don't
Make your check, come at they neck
Disrespect us? No, they won't

Boy, don't even try to touch this
Boy, this beat is crazy
This is how they made me
Houston, Texas, baby

This goes out to all my girls
That's in the club rocking the latest
Who will buy it for themselves
And get more money later

I think I need a barber
None of these niggas can fade me
I'm so good with this
I remind you, I'm so hood with this

Boy, I'm just playing
Come here, baby
Hope you still like me
F-U, pay me!

My persuasion
Can build a nation
Endless power
With our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me

It's hot up in here
DJ don't be scared to run this, run this back
I'm repping for the girls who taking over the world
Help me raise a glass for the college grads

41' Rollie to let you know what time it is
Check!
You can't hold me (you can't hold me)
I work my nine to five, better cut my check!

This goes out to all the women getting it in
Get on your grind
To the other men that respect what I do
Please, accept my shine

Boy, you know you love it
How we're smart enough to make these millions
Strong enough to bear the children
Then get back to business

See, you better not play me
Oh, come here, baby
Hope you still like me
F-U, pay me!

My persuasion
Can build a nation
Endless power
With our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me
