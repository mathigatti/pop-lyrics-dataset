Uh, uh

[Timbaland]
Hey baby, how you
Why your face lookin' all sad and blue
Don't you like the Navigator truck that I brought you
Why you tryin' to act a fool
Don't try to say you seen me talking to your
girlfriends
Ask Tonya and Shirl then
Gimme a place and time when
Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff that I'm doing
on the streets
You gotta remember, without you, there's no me
I'm just an average man
Tryin' to make it in this cold world
So tell me baby, why you trippin', girl


[Beyonce]
I don't wanna fuss with you
So I'm gonna sit out on the couch
Don't try to talk to me
Cause boy I am locking you out
I don't wanna hear a thing
Nothing you got to say
You should think twice
About the way you've been talking to me

Chorus

Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
Talking all that junk
Gonna pack my stuff
Is this what you want
I don't really care
Cause there is no more us

Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
Talking all that junk
Gonna pack my stuff
Is this what you want
I don't really care
Cause

[LeToya]
Ain't got no words for you
So you can stop callin' my friends
Tellin' them it wasn't your fault
And why I ain't letting you in
Too many times before
I let you back in my life
But this is a new day
And this won't go down tonight

Chorus

Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
Talking all that junk
Gonna pack my stuff
Is this what you want
I don't really care
Cause there is no more us

Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
Talking all that junk
Gonna pack my stuff
Is this what you want
I don't really care
Cause there is no more us

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Timbaland]
Introduced you to Dolce and Garbana
Advance you from the dirt bikes to Hondas
Took you from that terrible stress
Now you telling me that I am a bother
What kind of mess is that
To tell a man who put you on his team
That's just like killing a dream
(No no baby) That's how it seems
I worked hard to build up what I have for you
I pray to God, that there's not another man between me
and you
So just tell me
There's no need to lie folk
While you sittin' with your eyes closed
Do you wanna talk, aight yo

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Chorus

Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
Talking all that junk
Gonna pack my stuff
Is this what you want
I don't really care
Cause there is no more us

Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
Talking all that junk
Gonna pack my stuff
Is this what you want
I don't really care
Cause

Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
Talking all that junk
Gonna pack my stuff
Is this what you want
I don't really care
Cause there is no more us

Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
Talking all that junk
Gonna pack my stuff
Is this what you want
I don't really care
Cause there is no more us
