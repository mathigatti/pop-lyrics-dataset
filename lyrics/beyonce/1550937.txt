You're all alone, and I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame


How you gave me all of you
And wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you
But all I made you was lonely

I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed

I should've been there, I should've been there
I should've been there, I should've been there

All of the times you used to cry
Because I would let you down
I'm losing time, I should've tried
A little more to be around

But I didn't know you that were hurting
I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain
Another you I'll never find

I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed

I should've been there (ooO0Oo), I should've been there (ooO0Oo)
I should've been there (ooO0Oo), I should've been there (ooO0Oo)

I'm filled with regret, I'm gonna tip
And sew/soak myself in misery
Now in your life I'll take more time
No more yearning without me

But it hurts to think of you
All by yourself and now I see
And I apologize for all the times
I left you home waiting for me

I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed

I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there

I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there
