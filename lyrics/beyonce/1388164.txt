Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I

If I wrote a book about where we stand
In the title of my book would be "Life with Superman"
That's how you make me feel
I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same
I see it everyday
And all the things you do
And all the things you say


You are my roc
Baby you're the truth
You are my roc
I love to rock with you
You are my roc
You're everything I need
You are my roc
So baby rock with me

I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just fine
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my roc
I love to roc with you
I love to roc with you

Oh oh oh I

If I wanna try to count the ways
You make me smile
I'll run out of fingers
Before I run out of time
To sing to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
make me wanna keep my lovin strong
make me wanna try my best
To give you what you want and what you need
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece
More than a minimum, I'm talking everything
More than a single wish, I'm talking every dream

You are my roc
Baby you are the truth
You are my roc
I love to roc with you
You are my roc
You're everything I need
You are my roc
So baby roc with me

I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just fine
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do

yeah there's options I dont want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you
I like us just fine
You're a roc in the sand
You're a smile in a cry
You're my joy through the pain
You're the truth through the lies
No matter what I do
I know that I can count on you

Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
