Yee-haw (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Texas, Texas (ooh, ooh, ooh), Texas


Came into this world
Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Daddy made me dance
And daddy held my hand
And daddy liked his whiskey with his tea

And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said: Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
Oh, and that's when he gave to me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said: Shoot!
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!

He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone: Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Texas

Daddy made me fight
It wasn't always right
But he said: Girl, it's your second amendment (ooh, ooh, ooh)
He always played it cool
But daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said: Remember

He said: Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
And that's when daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said: Shoot!
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!

He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone: Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!
Ooh, ooh, ooh

(Woo)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Play (woo, woo, woo)
Hey yeah (Texas)
Oh, ooh (Texas) oh, ooh
Ooh, ooh oh-oh-oh
(Yeoh)
I think, I think
I think, I think, I think, I think
Oh, ooh

Now they sound tired, but they don't sound Haggard
They've got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think

My daddy warned me about men like you
He said: Baby girl, he's playing you
He's playing you! Oh
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said: Baby girl, he's playing you
He's playing you (he's playing you!)

'Cause when trouble comes in town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!
'Cause when trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot!
My daddy said: Shoot!

Good job, B!
(Hey!)
Ayy, I know! I hope you, uh, secretly recorded that
(That's 'cause we're all sweating
We warm, we loose, we're like: Oh, it's not recording today)
We're good
(That's how it works)
