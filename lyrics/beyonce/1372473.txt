Satellites...flashing by...


It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation
Think how happy we can be
When we just try

When nothing like we've seen
Passionate words were never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side

In your eyes
Love's alive
We've come on time
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites

Satellites

Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change
We're always on display
Let's run and hide

In our eyes
Love's alive
We've come on time
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites

Satellites

If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We had all the love we need
While we're apart I cannot breathe

Satellites...flashing by..
