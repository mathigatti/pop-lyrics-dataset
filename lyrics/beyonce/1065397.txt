Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say: Baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?


Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say: Baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

Any other day, I would call, you would say
Baby, how's your day? But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is: Uh huh, yeah okay
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took her there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me and the other girl you playin'
Why don't you say the things you said to me yesterday?

I know you sayin' that I'm assuming things
(Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems)
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
(If nobody's holding you back from me)
'Cause I know how you usually do
(When you sayin' everything to me, times two)
Why can't you just tell the truth?
(If someone's there, then tell me who)

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say: Baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say: Baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

What is up with this? Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, see, you got to bounce
When two seconds ago, said you just got in the house
It's so hard to believe that you are home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel you got to lie?
I'm caught in your game when you cannot say my name

I know you sayin' that I'm assuming things
(Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems)
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
(If nobody's holding you back from me)
'Cause I know how you usually do
(When you sayin' everything to me, times two)
Why can't you just tell the truth?
(If someone's there, then tell me who)

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say: Baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say: Baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh

I know you sayin' that I'm assuming things
(Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems)
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange

Why can't you just tell the truth?
(If someone's there, then tell me who)

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say: Baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say: Baby I love you

Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady
