Star...
I'm wishing... wishing... wishing on a star...


I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see
I'm wishing on the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow, praying it'll comes
And I'm wishing on the other things we've ever done

I never thought I'd see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we spent
I just can't let you go, for me you were meant
And I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow
(so-o-o-o-w)

I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby
When we're together, whether or never
I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby
When we're together (let's get together, baby),
whether or never

I'm wishing on a star (wishing on a star)
To follow where you are (to follow where you are)
I'm wishing on a dream (wishing on a dream)
To follow what it means (to follow what it means)
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see
I'm wishing on the people who really dream
I'm hoping on the days to come and days to go
I'm hoping on the days of loving, loving you so

Baby, Forgive me
Let's make up, I'm sorry
Let's be together, break up? Never
The love we have has been special so far
Till we get back from wishing on a star
