Come, take my hand
I won't let you go
I'll be your friend
I will love you so deeply
I will be the one
To kiss you at night
I will love you
Until the end of time


I'll be your baby
I promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy
I say you'll never let me go

Say you'll never let me go
S-Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
S-Say you'll never let me go

Take you away from here
There's nothing between us
But space and time
I'll be your own little star
I'll be shining your world
In your own little universe
Make me your girl

Come take my hand
I won't let you go
I'll be your friend
I will love you so deeply
I will be the one
To kiss you at night
I will love you
Until the end of time

I'll be your baby
I promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy
I say you'll never let me go

Say you'll never let me go
S-Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
S-Say you'll never let me go

Baby, come on
Get up on this
Show me that you really want it
I wanna be the one to love you
Baby, let's go!
(Let's go)

I wanna provide
This loving that you're giving
I ain't frontin' on this love
Can you let me love you from head to toe
Baby, let's go!

Boy, come to me
Let me turn your rain into sun

You don't have to worry
I promise I?ll set your heart free
Let my love run to your soul
You go
I go
We go
That's all
