It really hurts to say this, yes it does
But after our sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was


But what gets so confusing baby?
You and me..
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me

Well I'm alone now, but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now, but I ain't the only
Honestly, I'm final take this time to concentrate on me
And I've got possibility to keep me company

Won't you just disown, he doesn't care
To eternalize it all just isn't fair
So why address the problem so that he
But I still feel alone, lonely, when he's there

Maybe we can fix it baby, I know we can
If I make you miss it baby, then maybe you would understand

That I'm alone now, but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now, but I ain't the only
Honestly, I'm final take this time to concentrate on me
And I've got possibility to keep me company

Lalalalala...

Well I'm alone now, but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now, but I ain't the only
Honestly, I'm final take this time to concentrate on me
And I've got possibility to keep me company
