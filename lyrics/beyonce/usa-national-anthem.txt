Oh, say can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?


Whose broad stripes and bright stars
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming

And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there

Oh say does that star-
Spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
The brave
