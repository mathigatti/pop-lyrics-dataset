Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies (come on girl, tell me how you feel)
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams
Baby boy, not a day goes by
Without my fantasies (come on girl, tell me what's the deal)
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams

[Beyoncé]
Ah, oh, my baby's fly, baby, oh
Yes, no, hurt me so good, baby, oh
I'm so wrapped up in your love, let me go
Let me breathe, stay out my fantasies

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Baby boy, you are so damn fine
So if you know this dance
Baby boy, won't you be mine?
I want you to do it, here we go
Baby boy, let's conceive an angel
