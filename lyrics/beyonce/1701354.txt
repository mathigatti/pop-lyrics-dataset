In this world
Of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you


In this world
Of over-rated pleasures
Of under-rated treasures
I'm glad there is you

I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This role so new,
I'll walk it through with you to guide me

In this world
Where many, many play at love
But hardly ever stay in love
I'm glad there is you

More than ever,
I'm glad there is you
More than ever,
I'm glad there is you, you
