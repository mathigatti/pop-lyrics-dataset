Some of them men think they freak this
Like we do
But no they don't
Make your check come at they neck
Disrespect us?
No they won't

Boy don't even try to touch this
Boy this beat is crazy
This is how they made me
Houston, Texas baby

This goes out to all my girls
That's in the club rocking the latest
Who will buy it for themselves
And get more money later

I think I need a barber
None of these bitch can fade me
I'm so good with this
I remind you I'm so hood with this

Boy I'm just playing
Come here baby
Hope you still like me
If you hate me

My persuasion
Can build a nation
Endless power
The love we can devour

You'll do anything for me

Who run the world?
Girls! (9x)

It's hot up in here DJ
Don't be scared to run this, run this back
I'm reppin' for the girls
Who taken' over the world
Let me raise a glass
For the college grads

Buddy one roll and
I'll let you know what time it is
You can't hold me
I broke my 9 to 5 better cop my cheque

This goes out to all the women
Getting it in
Get on your grind
To all the men that respect
What I do
Please accept my shine

Boy you know you love it
How we're smart enough to make these millions
Strong enough to bear the children
Then get back to business

See, you better not play me
Oh, come here baby
Hope you still like me
If you hate me

My persuasion
Can build a nation
Endless power
The love we can devour

You'll do anything for me
