[Beyoncé]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
Get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
(Coachella, I wanna hear y'all sing)
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you
Drunk in love
(How y'all doin' over here?)
I want you


We woke up in the kitchen
Saying: How the hell did this shit happen?
Oh, baby (I can see you all the way, all the way back there)
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
(Sing it, y'all)

We be all night (Sing, come on, sing)
We be all night (Sing, hey)

We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints 'cause my body so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-Eleven
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin', if you scared, call that reverend
(Boy, I'm drinkin') Get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard (Surfboard)
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood (Wood)
I'm swervin' on his, swerve-swervin' on his big body Benz
Surfin' all on his (Surfs up)
Good good

Hey
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night (Sing it, hey)
We be all night

[Beyoncé &amp; Fast Life Yungstaz]
Ride it with my surfboard
(Man, I got that swag)
Surfboard, surfboard
(My hat matchin' my bag)
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
(You know I'm poppin' tags)
I'm swervin' on his, swerve-swervin' on his big body Benz
(And man I got that swag)
Ahh, you

[Fast Life Yungstaz]
I swag when I surf
I swag when I surf
I swag when I surf
Now watch me surf and swag
I swag when I surf
I swag when I surf
I swag when I surf
Now watch me surf and swag

[Beyoncé]
Surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
Swervin' on his, swerve-swervin' on his big body Benz
Surfin' all on his, surf-surfin' all on his good good

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left (Sing it)
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
Say I'm a-a diva (Sing it)
I'm a-a diva
Say I'm a-a diva (Sing it)
I'm a-a diva (Louder)
I'm a-a diva (Louder)
I'm a-a diva (Can't hear you)
I'm a-a diva (Sing it)
I'm a-a diva
Come on
