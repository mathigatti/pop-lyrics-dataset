Off with your head
Dance 'til you're dead
Heads will roll
On the floor


Glitter on the west streets
Silver over everything
The rivers all wet
You're all chrome

Dripping with alchemy
Shiver stop shivering
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome

The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no

Off off with your head
Dance dance 'til you're dead
Heads will roll
On the floor

You can last
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Mirror lies

Glitter on the west streets
Silver over everything
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome
You're all chrome

Oh oh

Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance 'til you're dead
Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance 'til you're dead
Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance 'til you're dead
