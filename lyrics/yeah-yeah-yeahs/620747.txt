Green hours
Blue rope
Well, hot wax, four heart are cold
We're three, we're three in the dark tonight
And baby, my snake is a shark tonight


He's got youth on his side
He's got small purple eyes
Now he's as straight as a bone
When there's nobody home

Everywhere kiss me
Everywhere kids speak
No catch, no beat
Everywhere kiss me, everywhere kiss me

Everywhere kiss me
Everywhere kids meet
No catch, no beat
Everywhere kiss, everywhere kiss, kiss me

Now move I'm gonna come dry
I dropped my musings out of sight
I drank until the waters dried
It's all cute 'til someone dies

Shoot my name up every vein
You can't get hurt, you can't complain
No feet, no hands, no tail, no lies
He's got youth on his side

Everywhere kiss me
Everywhere kids speak
No catch, no beat
Well, everywhere me, everywhere kiss me

Everywhere kiss me
Everywhere kids meet
No catch, no beat
Well, everywhere kiss, everywhere kiss, kiss me

We're three, we're three, we're three
We're three, we're three in the dark tonight
And baby, my snake is a shark tonight
