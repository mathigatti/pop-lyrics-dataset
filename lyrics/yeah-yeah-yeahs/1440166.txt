I was feeling sad
Can't help looking back
Highways flew by
Run, run away
No sense of time
Like you to stay
Want to keep you inside


Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize

Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize

I was feeling sad
Can't help looking back
Highways flew by
Run, run away
No sense of time
Like you to stay
Want to keep you inside

All along, not so strong without these open arms
Hold on tight
All along, not that strong without these open arms
Lie beside
All along, not so strong without these open arms
Ride beside

Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize

Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize
