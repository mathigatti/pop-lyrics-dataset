Wasteful season take my hand
Take the place of the snakes who ran


Hey
Ohh

Savage things wash over me 
A crime that leave the heated green

Oh Machine
Machine
I washed it for you
Oh Machine
Machine 
I wasted for you 

And i walk 
And i walk
The space left for two
And i wait
And i wait
Too wake next to you

Machine 
Machine

I washed it for you
