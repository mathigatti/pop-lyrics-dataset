10 lines leaning to the seashore
Water's gonna lead the dogs my way
10 wives tearin' up my leisure
Pressin' little mouths gonna talk my way
Gonna talk my way
Uh huh!


Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Stollen my wife 
Stollen my night
Gonna take him into my life
Into my life

3 males pounded in the front door
Start a few fires and have my way
3 males the trench is in the back porch
Studded little motuhs gonna talk my way
Gonna talk my way
Uh huh!

Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Stollen my wife 
Stollen my night
Gonna take him into my...
Into my life
Into my life

10 lines leading to the seashore
Water's gonna lead the dogs my way
10 wives tearin' up my leisure
Pried a few bars and had my way
Uh huh!
Oh oh!
Uh huh!
Oh oh! 
Oh oh oh!
Uh huh!
Uh huh!
Ah ah ah!
