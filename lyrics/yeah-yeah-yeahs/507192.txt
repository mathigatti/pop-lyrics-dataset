When it's missing and you want it more
it isn't right
Turning turning out the door
and back to this
Leave it like it was before
and let me out
Must've been the end of the story


Giving it all
Giving it all away
You're going to wake up someone
Study it all
The wings, they crowd your face
You're going to end up like one

Trouble at home
Travel away you say
The road don't like me
Travel away
Travel it all away
The road's going to end on me

Men, they like me
'cause I'm a warrior
A warrior
Stand on my feet
Danced the warrior
The warrior
Where would I be?
I'd be a warrior
A warrior

Now the strangers have caught on
and they're riding in the back seat
The rivers going to wash all
Yeah, the river it spoke to me
It told me I'm small
and I swallowed it down
If I make it at all
I'll make you want me

Trouble at home
Travel away, you say
The road don't like me
Travel it all
Travel it all away
The road's going to get all me

And I'm small
The road's going to get all me
If it gets it at all
The road's going to end all me

Like a warrior
A warrior
Danced the warrior
The warrior
