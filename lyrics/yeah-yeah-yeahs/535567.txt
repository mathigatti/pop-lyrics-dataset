Hot cold season gonna sink in my sweat
No one is ever gonna make it there yet
Can't even cope with it
When it passes me by
And we'll take it over
And make it mine


Fast slow living is holding me back
Wishing my baby never told me that
Can't even cope to make it last
Then it passed me by
We'll take it over
And make it mine

And you wanted it wanted it wanted it again

My dear you've been used
I'm breaking in the news
Well love nearly beat us
I'm thinking like you, I'm thinking of you
Well love follows near us, can love really steer us?
Oh can't it be true? Oh can't it be true?

Lost all reason from playing your games
Better quit staring cuz you're looking the same
Can't even cope to make a change
Then it passed me by
And we'll take it, over
And make it, mine

Use me up, use me up take it off (?)
