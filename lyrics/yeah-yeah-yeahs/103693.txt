Don't hold on
And go get strong
Well, don't you know
That there is no
Modern romance


Time
Time is gone
It stops, stops who it wants
Well, I was wrong
It never lasts
And there is no
Well, this is no
Modern romance

And time
Time is gone
It never lasts
Stops who it wants
Well, I was wrong
It never lasts
This is no
There is no
Modern romance
There is no modern romance
This is no...modern romance
there is no, there is no....

(long pause)

baby I'm afraid of a lot of things
but I aint scared of loving you
baby I know your afraid of a lot of things
but don't be scared of love
cause people will say all kinds of things
that don't mean a damn to me
cause all I see is what's in front of me
and thats you

well, I've been dragged all over the place
I've taken hits time just don't erase
and baby I can see you've been fucked with too
but that don't mean your loving days are through
cause people will say all kinds of things
that don't mean a damn to me
cause all I see is what's in front of me
and thats you

well I may be just a fool
but I know youÂ´re just as cool
and cool kids they belong together
