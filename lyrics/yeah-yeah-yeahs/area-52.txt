Message came from outer space
Future of the human race
Hell is not the hottest place
Let it go, shed your skin
Children never sleep again!


I wanna be your passanger
Take me as your prisoner
I wanna be an alien
Take me please, oh alien
I wanna be an alien
Take me, oh, oh

Your instruments can't stop our ships
Soon you'll be our guinea pigs
The rest will all be blown to bits
Let it go, you had your day
Spacemen take your kids away

I wanna be your passenger
Take me as your prisoner
I wanna be an alien
Take me please
I wanna be an alien
Take me please, oh alien

You must taste our violent fuzz
Your wars are of no use to us
You cannot fix what never was
Let it go, had your day
The meteor is on its way!

I wanna be your passenger
Take me as your prisoner
I wanna be an alien
Take me please, oh alien
I wanna be your alien
Take me please, oh alien
