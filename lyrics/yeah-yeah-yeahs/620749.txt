Shake it
Shake it
North, west, south, left
East and to the right
Now take it
To a place we've never been
Out of sight


Well the floor girl
Is yours girl
To alight
And the score girl
Will be settled
On the floor tonight

Now shake
North, west, south, left
East and to the right
Take it
To a place that never moves
To a place we've never been
Yeah, outta sight

Now shake it
Shake shake
Yeah, shake it
Shake, shake
Ha!
