My confession is the tension of our love
My profession is not to question our love
My confession is the tension of our love
My profession is not to question our love


I want you
I want you
now
I want you
I want you
now

Pace the floor
Groove side to side
If you want to glow
by the carbon light
Pace the floor
Groove side to side
Don't sway to the flow of the 45
Pace the floor
Groove side to side
If you want to glow
by the carbon light
Pace the floor
Groove side to side
Don't sway to the flow of the 45

I want you
I want you
now
I want you
I want you
now

Days months weeks months years
Minute after minute after minute son, disappear

Pace the floor
Groove side to side
If you want to glow
by the carbon light
Pace the floor
Groove side to side
Don't sway to the flow of the 45
Pace the floor

I want you
I want you
now
I want you
I want you
now
I want you
I want you
now

My confession is the tension of our love
My profession is not to question our love
