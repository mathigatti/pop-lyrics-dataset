Down down under the earth goes another lover
12 tongues put a hex on ya
Small mouths don't dare to shout it out
No fun for a night out
No fun for a night out on the town


Runaway runaway not a ghost or roach would stay
You're on your own on your on own you're not safe

Down down under the earth goes another lover
Milk you for what you're worth and call it murder
Down down under the earth goes another lover

12 tongues put a hex on ya
