With every breath I breathe
I'm making history
With your name on my lips
The ages fall to bits


In flames I sleep soundly
With angels around me
I lay at your feet
You're the breath that I breathe

Some kind of violent bliss
Led me to love like this
One thousand deaths my dear
I'm dying without you here

In flames I sleep soundly
With angels around me
I lay at your feet
You're the breath that I breathe

You're the breath that I breathe
The breath that I breathe
The breath that I breathe
You're the breath that I breathe
