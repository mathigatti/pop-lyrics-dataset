Shot down from real high
She's a wet dream -ha
She's so fly
I'm an old coat on a hot day
Got fire in my belly
Baby lookin' my way


I think she's putting on water
I think she's putting on water
She set my sights on fire
I think she's putting on water

6 lane
6 lane
Burry me alive and i'm not kidding
I said
6 lane
6 lane
Burry me alive and i'm not kidding c'mon

Now a black cat run fast
Take a hit of this and let's make it last
Come on switch my lanes to win my friend
I'll take you on a ride baby til the end

I think she's putting on water
I think she's putting on water
She set my sights on fire
I think she's putting on water

6 lane
6 lane
Burry me alive and i'm not kidding
I said
6 lane
6 lane
Burry me alive and i'm not kidding
I said
6 lane
6 lane
Burry me alive and i'm not kidding
I said
6 lane
6 lane
Burry me alive and i'm not kidding baby
