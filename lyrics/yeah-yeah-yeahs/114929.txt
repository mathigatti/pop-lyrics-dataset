It was the struggle of the century
and all the grown men came to see
the girl who tamed the tiger yeah yeah
the heart of southern Lovebirds
they found her under the sea
she said she came from cell block three
the girl hit hot like a barracuda baby
she floated on air like a crest of wave
she was a primal instituation she was a danger to herself yeah


Mad loving by the cold hearted
Take a big breath cos we just started

Mystery Girl
Mystery Girl
keep on faking your mystery world
Cos the mystery boys will be your toys yeah
Cos the Mystery boys will be your toys

Not a day goes by i wanna disappear
Into her eyes a mother pearl
and my head feels dead with all this useless fighting
But my heart aint dead cuz it keeps on loving
the girl hit hard like a barrauda baby
she floated on air like a crest of wave
she was a primal instituation she was a danger to herself yeah

Mad loving by the codl hearted
take a big breath cuz we just started

Mystery Girl
Mystery Girl
Keep on faking your mystery world
Cos the Mystery boys will be your toys yeah [x4]
there be your toys alright
there be your toys
