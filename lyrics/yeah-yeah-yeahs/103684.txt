I got a date with the night
Putting out my finger
Gonna catch the kids dry
Gonna walk on water
Buying out the fight
We're sweatin in the winter


Bone thigh squeeze tight
Chow chow chow chow chow
Chow chow chow chow chow

Don't tell me to fix her
Don't tell me to fix her
Well just take a bite
No hangin no picture
Flyin out my sight
Droppin brides at the altar

Bone thigh squeeze tight
Chow chow chow chow chow
Chow chow chow chow chow!

I'll set you
I'll set it off
I'll set you
I'll set it off
I'll set you
I'll set it off
I'll set you
I'll set it off, ah ha!

I'll set you
I'll set it off
I'll set you
I'll set it off
I'll set you
I'll set it off
I'll set you
I'll set it off ah ah!

Buying out the fight
Gonna walk on water
Gonna catch the kids dry
Gonna bend my finger

Flyin out my sight
We're sweatin in the winter
Bone thigh squeeze tight
Bone thigh squeeze tight
