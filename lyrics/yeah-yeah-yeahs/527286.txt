I know what I know
I know on car ride down
I hear it my head real low
Turn into the only thing I ever
Turn into hope I do
Turn into you


I know what I know
Well I know that girl you found
Keep that kind of window closed
She'll turn into the only thing that ever...
Turn into, hope I do, turn into you

Can't say why I kept this from you
My those quiet eyes become ya
Leave it where it can't remind us
Turn this all around behind us
Oh... Well I know
How far I am to keep you out,
I'd like to tell you all about it

I know what I know
I know this last time round
I'll hear it in my head real low
Turn into the only thing that ever known
Only thing that ever knows...
