Falala falala falala ahaa ..

All I want for Christmas is for you to be near (be near, be near)
Warm me up with kisses and cheer (and cheer, and cheer)
I think I may have missed it, maybe even wished it,
My only Christmas wish is for you to be near (be near, be near)


Falala falala falala ahaa .. (2x)

All I want for Christmas this year (this year)
Still warm you up with kisses and cheer (and cheer, and cheer)
I think I have missed it, maybe even wished it
My only Christmas wish is for you to be near (be near, be near)

Falala falala falala ahaa .. (2x)

All I want for Christmas this year (this year)
All I want, All I want, all I want is you...
