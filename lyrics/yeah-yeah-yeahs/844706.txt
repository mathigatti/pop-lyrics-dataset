Things are feeling thin
I know, I know
lost my seat again
Well, I'll go, i'll go,
Pushing in the pin
Well, I know, I know


We're gonna go back in
We're gonna go, go, go

Bah (x8)
Dunno (x4)

I like to sleep with them
Pushing in the pin
I like to sleep with them
I know, I know

We're gonna go back in
We're gonna go go go
We're gonna go back in
We're gonna go go go

Bah (x8)
Dunno (x4)
