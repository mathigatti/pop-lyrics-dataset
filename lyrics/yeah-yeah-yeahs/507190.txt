Cheated by the opposite of love
Held on high and up up up above
Kept my high from the second one
Kept my eye on the first one now
Take these rings and store them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and store them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day


Well I'm take it take it take it take it taking it off
And she's take it take it take it take it taking it off
And he's take it take it take it take it taking it off
And we're take it take it take it take it taking it off

Well sometimes I think that I'm bigger than the sound
I think that I'm bigger than the sound
I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well I think that I'm bigger than the sound

She takes on high
She takes on high
She takes on high

Well sometimes I think that I'm bigger than the sound
I think that I'm bigger than the sound
I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well I think that I'm bigger than the sound

Cheated by the opposite of love
Held on high and up up up above
Kept my high from the second one
Kept my eye on the first one now
Take these rings and store them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and store them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and store them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and store them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
