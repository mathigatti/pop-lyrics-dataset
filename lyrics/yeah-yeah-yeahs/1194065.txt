If I tell you
What you want
Then you'll be
Over me
If I tell you
What you want
Then you'll be
Over me


Used to tell you
What you want
Made you be
Over me
If I let you
See me cry
Lose much lust
Yes, lust each time

If you care
For someone else
I'll be left here with myself
When you save
Every breath
Brings me closer to my death
