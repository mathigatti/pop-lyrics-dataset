Baby I'm afraid of a lot of things
But I aint scared of loving you
Baby I know you're afraid of a lot of things
But don't be scared of love
'Cause people will say all kinds of things
That don't mean a damn to me
'Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you


Well, I've been dragged all over the place
I've taken hits, time just don't erase
And baby I can see you've been fucked up too
But that don't mean your lovin' days are through
Cause people will say all kinds of things
That don't mean a damn to me
Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you

Well I may be just a fool
But I know you're just as cool
And cool kids they belong together
