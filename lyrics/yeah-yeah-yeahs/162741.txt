I go through all this
Before you wake up
To feel happier
And safe with you again


I go through all this
Before you wake up
To feel happier
And safe with you again

I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make
On their way down
When it lands
Will my eyes
Be closed or open?

I go through all this
Before you wake up
To feel happier
And safe with you again

I go through all this
Before you wake up
To feel happier
And safe with you again
And safe with you
