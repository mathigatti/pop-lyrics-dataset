No Longer, no Longer
What You Ask
Strange Steps
Heels Turned Black
The cinders the cinders
They light the path
And these strange steps
Take us back, take us back


Flow sweetly, hang heavy
You suddenly complete me
You suddenly complete me
Flow sweetly, hang heavy
You suddenly complete me
You suddenly complete me

Oh oh aaayyy
Oh oh ayyee
Hysteric
Oh oh aaayyy
Oh oh ayeee
Hysterical

No wonder, no wonder,
Other half, strange steps
Heels turned black.
The cinders they splinter
And light the path
And These strange steps
Trace us back, trace us back

Flow sweetly, hang heavy
You suddenly complete me
You suddenly complete me
Flow sweetly, hang heavy
You suddenly complete me
You suddenly complete me

Hysterical
Hysterical
Hysterical
Hysterical
Hysterical
