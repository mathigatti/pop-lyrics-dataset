Twist, twist
Twist, for Ice-Cream 
C'mon dance, Misdirection 
You can take new nicks for Blue Jeans 
But it's 3, or it's dead. Aww


We are trapped, keep it violent
I need tape, for perfection 
The most bright, I'm assuming 
Love the smell of your bath 
Aww

Sci-Fi 
Half-Time 
Mr. you're on fire Mr. 
No sir I'm okay 
Mr. you're on fire Mr. 
No sir I'm okay 
Mr. you're on fire Mr. 
No sir I'm okay 
Mr. you're on fire Mr. 
No sir I'm okay...
