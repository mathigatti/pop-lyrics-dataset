I find it in an atlas
Well, flippin' over old news
Check what's in the trash bag
Well just another part of you
Well just another part of you
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon
Oh-ah!


Blame me for where you are
Tell me what I gotta lose
'bout to get fancy
Well just another part of you
Well just another part of you
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon
Oh-ah!

We ran for three days
We ran for three days
We ran for three days
We ran for three days
We ran

We ran over it
Like a perfect fit
Didn't meet our
Didn't meet our eyes
Watch it from the next island
We ran over it
Like a perfect fit
Didn't meet our
Didn't meet our eyes
Watch it from the next island

Well just another part of you
Well just another part of you
Well just another part of you
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon
Oh-ah!

We ran for three days
We ran for three days
We ran for three days
We ran for three days
We ran...
