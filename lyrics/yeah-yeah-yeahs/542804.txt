No fame
All there is
All there was
On the second lady
Can't take a cent
Take a cut of that
Kind of ran
I'll stand, kind of pushed
Kind of bent
On that heavy land
I'll stand for the sake of my friends
Well, I will see him there


Down
Down
Count me down
Down
Down, boy
Down
Count me down
Down, boy
Down, boy
Down, boy
Down

The same
Not begin
Not give up
In a better way
Again, kept the stain
Off his bed
Not to split them off
I'll stand for the sake of my friends
I will see him there
Well, I will see him there

Down
Down
Count me down
Down
Down, boy
Down
Count me down
Down, boy
Down, boy
Down, boy
Down
Down
Count me down
Down
Down, boy
