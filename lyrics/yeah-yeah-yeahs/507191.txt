Gold lions gonna tell me where the light is
Gold lions gonna tell me where the light is
Take our hands out of control
Take our hands out of control
Tell me what you saw
Tell me what you saw


There was a crowd of seas
Inside
Outside
I must of done a dozen each
It was the height I grew
Wait the show is crushing you
I've been around a few
Tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to

Gold lions gonna tell me where the light is
Gold lions gonna tell me where the light is
Take our hands out of control
Take our hands out of control

Outside
Inside
This is a moon without a tide
We'll dim the fire in your eyes
We'll dim the fire
When the colors
Gettin' brighter
Cold as I
Makes a move without a tide
Tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to
