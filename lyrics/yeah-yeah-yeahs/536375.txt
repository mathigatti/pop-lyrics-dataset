Turn yourself around, you weren't invited
Good good things happen in bad towns
Good good things happen in bad towns


Runaway, runaway you want it
Runaway, runaway you want it
Runaway anyway you want it
Runaway, runaway you want it

What, what did you do to your back hips
Soft ones, curled lips can't get 'em back
Junk jump off too much time for
Old beats, cold beats, I'm just cold meat

Runaway, runaway you want it
Runaway, runaway you want it
Runaway anyway you want it
Runaway, runaway you want it

Oh all alone
I've got a call from the bear
Gonna take all his honey honey
Done, all alone
I've got a call from the bear
Gonna take all its honey honey
Done, all alone
I've got a call from the bear
Gonna take all his honey honey
Done, all alone
I've got a call from the bear
Gonna take all its honey honey

Runaway, runaway you want it
Runaway, runaway you want it
Runaway anyway you want it
Runaway, runaway you want it

What
What
What
