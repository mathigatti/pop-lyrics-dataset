My mouth, you're touching. Your mouth is running. No loving, for nothing. Nobody knock my body out.

My mouth is blowing right off, I'm so gone. I'm coming, out clubbin', not lovin', slow your body down.

How are you not going to show your scar?
How are you not going to get high, high?

My mouth is touching to your mouth is running. No loving, for nothing. Nobody knock my body out.

How are you not going to show your scar?
How are you not going to get high, high?
