I've strayed
Enough
Oh say say say
Oh say say say
Oh say say say
Oh say say say
Oh say say say


Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Maps...
Wait, they don't love you like I love you

Made off
Don't stray
Well my kind's your kind I'll stay the same

Pack up
Don't stray
Oh say say say
Oh say say say

Wait they don't love you like I love you
Wait they don't love you like I love you
Maps...
Wait they don't love you like I love you
Wait they don't love you like I love you
Maps...
Wait they don't love you like I love you
