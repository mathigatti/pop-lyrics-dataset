Did you find a boy you meant to destroy
Did you feel him?
Did you span the world for the red-eyed girl
Did you feel her?
Well makes me swamped
Yeah makes me sweat
Did you hear her?
And maybe she cries in the middle of the night
Did you feel her?
Hey...


Modern things don't die just stain (x2)

Well say you feel nice to break the ice, i'm ready
Now say the word i never heard, i'm ready
Well makes me strong
Yeah makes me strive
When i hear her
And maybe she cries in the middle of the night
Do you feel her?

Dry me off, i'm what i'm all about
And we can make some noise
Not like the other boys...

Hey ha!
Hey ho!
Ha ho!
Ha ha!

Modern things don't die just stain (x4)

Did you find a boy you meant to destroy
Did you heal him?
Did you span the world for the red-eyed girl
Did you feel her?
Well makes me strong 
Yeah makes me fight
Do you heal her?
And maybe she calls in the middle of the night
Do you feel her?
Hey!

Dry me off, i'm what i'm all about
And we can make some noise
Not like the other boys
And you can hold me tight
Yeah on a motor bike
Yeah we could make some noise
Yeah we could do this right...

Hey hey!
Yeah ho!
Hey hey!
Ha hey!

Modern things
Modern things
Modern things
Yeah, modern things
