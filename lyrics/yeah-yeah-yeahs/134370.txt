As the cars go by under the sun like an enemy
You Wonder [x3]
As a spider comes and looks at you like an enemy
You Wonder [x3]
Yeah Miles, miles away
She's hurting people in a better world
Miles, miles away
Dressed again in the hot water
You're more beautiful than ever
Looking in the car's rear view mirror
Floor is hard uncomforted
By the second time she wondered she hungered she hungers
like a killers wife
As the cars go by [x3]
Yeah as the cars go by
Miles, miles away
She's hurting people in a better world
Miles, miles away
Dressed again in the hot water
Well you're more beautiful than ever
Looking in the car's rear view mirror
You're more beautiful than ever
Miles, Miles away [x2]
