I, I, I, I, you
I, I, I, I, you, you!


What's it going, what's it going
What's it going to get?
So long you'll never be afraid
What's it going, what's it going
What's it going to get?
So long you'll never be the same

What's it going, what's it going
What's it going to get?
So long you'll never be afraid
What's it going, what's it going
What's it going to get?
So long you'll never be the same

Turn your head, look right at
None of these faces matter
These are the ones you see right through
If it's going to be at all
It's going to be with you

I, I, I, I, you!
I, I, I, I, you, you!
I, I, I, I, you!
I, I, I, I, you, you!

Who knows where we are?
Alive, alone
Tangled onto arms
Two arms, our own

As long as we're young
Keep you always in love
We're falling (rhythms)
Feel you holding us up(3X)

Crying for you...(8X)
