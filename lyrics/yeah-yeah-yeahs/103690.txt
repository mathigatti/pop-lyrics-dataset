I'm frozen
Like a soldier
Don't know where it stays
All over the place
Time froze
Like an ocean
Don't know the taste of a never ending ache
No No No No


Why hurry when i'm home
I hurry when i'm home
I'll go
No No No No

Why hurry when i'm home
I hurry when i'm home
I'll go
Oh i'll go

It's really not bad
Not worse than you thought
He'll never come back as the man you dropped
He'll never come back as the man you loved

It's not that bad
Not worse than you thought
He'll always come back as the man you dropped
He'll never come back as the man you loved

I told her
I told her
I told her
Oh go
I told her
I told her
I told her
No No No No No!

No No No No

Why hurry when i'm home
I hurry when i'm home
I'll go
No No No No

Why hurry when i'm home
I hurry when i'm home
I'll go
Oh i'll go

Shhhhhh.....
