Free yourself that leash is long long long
Free yourself that leash is long long long
Free yourself that leash is long long long
Free yourself that leash is long long long


I dreamt (dreamt dreamt)...
I was buried alive

Prognostic figure of speech to manifesto
Dr. Octagon move in the dark though
Multiply darkness, I'm the bright artist
Hologram image on the interface
Manage the code to bury them alive
Manage the code to bury them inside
Show smoke from the smoke machine
Lights on the top flash purple and green
Purple and mean, rise with the vampires
Look over skies from a high-rise
Doc Oc operate by the clock
Medicine bag come down by your block
Raise the dead, hypnotize with your head
Chemical react surgery to your head
Eyeballs up all night turn red

Free yourself that leash is long long long
Free yourself that leash is long long long
Free yourself that leash is long long long
Free yourself that leash is long long long

I was buried alive, I was buried alive, I was buried alive
I was buried alive, I was buried alive, I was buried alive
I was buried alive, I was buried alive, I was buried alive

Turn red...
