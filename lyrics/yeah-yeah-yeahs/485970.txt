I couldn't see 
I couldn't hear 
It shut me off
when you were near


Like a cloud
a dusty mirror
It disappears 
You disappear
All the sudden
all alone
I'm calling

"Love's gonna let me know"
Like the day you took me home
we counted every minute left to go
my love's gonna let you know

(ooo, wah) [x3]

Time without you drags me down
it all feels right with you around
it all feels right with you around
like the night we hit the ground
and all the lightning send a chill
can't forget about you still
all the sudden, all alone I'm calling out, I'm calling

"Love's gonna let me know"
Like the day you took me home
we counted every minute left to go
my love's gonna let you know

I'm calling out, I'm calling [x6]
