I get it from my mammy, and I know how to handle it 
Plus I got a motor like a banshee 
If that's ya man, girl you can forget it 
I'm standin by the bar, parrot-toed, bowlegged 
I make him wanna hit the bare guts 
It ain't his birthday, I'm the reason he got his hair cut 
Turned on by my stank walk, now he can't talk 
But I'ma give him what he came for 

Drop that shit, now roll wit it 
Drop that shit, now roll wit it 
Drop that shit, now roll wit it, roll wit it, roll wit it

Drop that shit, now roll wit it (make that booty roll) 
Drop that shit, now roll wit it, roll wit it, roll wit it 
(Make that booty roll)

Fine as a mu'fucker, shaped like a Coke bottle 
Nigga got a lump in his throat so he can't swallow 
Sh-she walkin' wit it, yeah that why ya ass'll get it 
Gotta keep it at a distance 
Cause if you walk my way nigga gon' be persistent 
Smack that ass, pat, pat 
Back that ass up to the back, back 

You got me daydreamin, havin wet dreams 
Jacki, is there anymore room in them jeans 
For a freaky motherfucker like me 
A ATL nigga wit a lot of gold teeth 
Goddamn you fine wit a big behind 
I just wanna touch your booty one time 
Is it soft like it look, I'm curious George 
Your booty put a smile on all the boys 

Drop that shit, now roll wit it

Said you like this chunky monkey and you want it 
Cause I ride it like a pony when I'm on it 
You just wanna get up on it so you can bone it 
I'ma have you givin loans of money for homes, yeah 
Queen of the South, Jacki-O gon' hold it down 
Boys seen them pictures in Vibe, they wanna blow me down 
They wanna show me round, they know it's sunshine 
They see the ghetto booty and they know it's lunchtime 
Gourmet cuisine got 'em actin silly 
He ain't even fuck, I only let him suck the titties 
Now we in Hong Kong, I got the thong on 
He on the phone, told his hoe that he ain't comin home 

Drop that shit, now roll wit it 
Drop that shit, now roll wit it 
Drop that shit, now roll wit it, roll wit it, roll wit it 
(He told me to) Drop that shit, now roll wit it 
Drop that shit, now roll wit it (make that booty roll) 
Drop that shit, now roll wit it, roll wit it, roll wit it
