Trailer red like the sea
Well I'm the son of a crowded bed
Find your love's gonna count for me
Your love that breaths, breeds
Gonna paste up our damn heads
Gonna drop, gonna drop, gonna count for me
Your love that breaths, breeds
Your love that's catchin' the breeze.
Son of a crowded bed
Son of a cloudy night
Well find your love's gonna count for me, your love's gonna count for me
We'll count down (8x)
Yeah


Waitin' for a chance to pass
Some ho say some say now go
Lookin' for a chance for speed
A love that breaths, breeds
High time getting past black
Gonna drop, gonna drop, gonna count for me
Your love that breaths, breeds
Your love that's catchin' the breeze
Son of a crowded bed
Son of a cloudy night
Find your love's gonna count for me, your love's gonna count for me
We'll count down (16x)
Yeah
