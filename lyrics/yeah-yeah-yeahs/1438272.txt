Ah-ah
Wu-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Ah-ah


I know
Talk to unknown
Ever
Lasts forever
It's a
Shock, shock
To your soft-side
Summer loom
Catch your shut-eye

In your room
In my room
In your room
In my room

Louder
Lips speak louder
Better
Back together

Still it's a
Shock, shock
To your soft-side
Summer looms
Catch your shut-eye
In my room
In your room
In my room
In your room

It's the time, it's the day
…don't leave me
It's the time, it's the day
…don't leave me
It's the time, it's the day
…don't leave me
It's the time, it's the place
Don't leave me… out
Leave me out
Leave me out
Leave me out

Wu-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Wu-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Ah-ah
Wu-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
