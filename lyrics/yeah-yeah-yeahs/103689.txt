Cold light, hot night
Be my heater be my lover
And we could do it to each other


Cold light, hot night
Be my heater be my lover
And we can do it to each other

Go go go go go
Hey oh

Ride daddy ride
Ride out the tide
I'd rather die
Then hear goodbye
And watch you go
Go go go go 
Hey oh

Ride daddy ride
Ride out the tide
I'd rather die
Then hear goodbye
And watch you go
Go go go go 
Hey!

Cold light, hot night
Be my heater be my lover
And we could do it to each other
Yeah we could do it to each other
Were like a sister and a brother

Go go go go go
Hey hey huh
Uhhh

Ride momma ride
Ride out the tide
I'd rather die
Then hear goodbye
And watch you go
