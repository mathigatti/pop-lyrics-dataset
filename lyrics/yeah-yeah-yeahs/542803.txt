Well black out
Well no time
The skin of the city is pulling real tight
Around the big head of the hot rind
The skin of the city is blushing at the sight
Of her, of her, of her, of her
It's deja vu


You got your
Big teeth with your big bite
You're ripping off the wrong tag shaking off the right
Can you sink ships with your pink thighs?
The skin of the city is shaking at the sight
Of her, of her, of her, of her
It's deja vu

Well here it is again
Can you make it to the end of the deja vu?
Well here it comes again
Can you make it to the end
Of her, of her, of her, of her, of her?

The way you look
Five beats slow
I'm wiggling

The way you look
Five beats slow
I'm wiggling

The way you look
Five beats slow
I'm wiggling

Well here it comes again
Can you make it to the end of the deja vu?
Well here it is again
Can you make it to the end of the deja vu?
Well here it comes again
Can you make it to the end
Of her, of her, of her, of her, of her?
