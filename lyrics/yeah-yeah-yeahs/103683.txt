I'm rich
Like a hot noise
Rich, rich, rich
I'll take you out boy


So stuck up
I wish you'd stick it to me
Flesh ripped off
Rawr-rawr-rawr-rawr-rawr-rawr raaaaawwwr!
Hey!

Turn it
Beating no beat
The walls are always speakin'
No want, no want, no want
No speakin' at all

She slipped
Down a rot drink
Unzipped
She doesn't exist
So unloved
I took'em standing up
So stuck up
Rawr-rawr-rawr-rawr-rawr-rawr raaaaawwwr!

I'm rich
Like a hot noise
Rich, rich, rich
I'll take you out boy
I'll take you out boy
Hey!

Hmm, turn it
Beating no beat
The walls are always speakin'
No want, no want, no want
No speakin' at all

Rich rich rich rich rich rich
