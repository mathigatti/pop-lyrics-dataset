Don't touch kid, sleep with the lights on
Touch kid, how you surprise me
Now roll kid, knock your body off


You're something like a phenomena
Something like an astronoma
Now roll kid, knock your body off

Something like a phenomena, babe
You're something like a phenomena
Something like a phenomena, babe
You're gonna get your body off

Don't fall asleep with the moonlight
She'll make you sweat in the water
Don't fall asleep with the moonlight
She'll make you sweat in the water

Hot time kid
Hot time kid
It's colder under the blanket
They loved it
Then shot it
The fastest ran and got it
That story that ease my
They hide it up the sleeves, my
They hide it
They hide it
They're never gonna find it

Don't fall asleep with the moonlight
She'll make you sweat in the water
Don't fall asleep with the moonlight
She'll make you sweat in the water

Something like a phenomena, babe
You're something like a phenomena
Something like a phenomena, babe
You're gonna get your body off
Something like a phenomena, babe
You're something like a phenomena
Something like a phenomena, babe
You're gonna get your body off

Hot time kid
Hot time kid
It's colder on the blanket
Hot time kid
Hot time kid
It's colder on the blanket
