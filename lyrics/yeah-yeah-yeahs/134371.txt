I'll kiss you once yeah I'll kiss you twice
I'll kiss you once yeah I'll kiss you twice
I'll kiss you once yeah I'll kiss you twice
And I get the shivers 'cause you're cold as ice



I'll dig you up and I'll get some
I'll be the one ticklin right in your ear
I'll dig your belly skin on tight 
I'll dig you you're comin home with me
I'll dig you up oh overnight
I'll dig you up
I'll dig you up

You take me home gonna rockin zombie
I got appetite for your body

I bring you flowers every night at ten like a night at ten
Well well well well
I gotta shows babe you got bone
Ow!
C'mon

I'll dig you up and I'll get some
I'll dig y-I'm the ticklin one in your ear
I'll dig y- the belly skin skin on tight
I'll dig y-- you're stayin over here
I'll dig you up oh overnight
I'll dig you up
I'll dig you up

I got your heart down in the cemetary
No cheers, there really scary
R-I-P R-I-P yeah R-I-P man right by me
Second verse sounds good to me
