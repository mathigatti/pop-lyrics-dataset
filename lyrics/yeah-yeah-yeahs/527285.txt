Green shadow
Want to wait all o- all over me
The end will shelter me away from me
Can we meet again
Meet and meet and meet and meet again
Can you fill the can
If you can feel me
Who you following?
Who you starting to move like?
Who you falling for?
Who you falling for?
Who's lies?
Who you following for?
You you falling for?
This sounds on your side!
Secret blue, purple, pink and green right over it
Hold on 'cause the coldest hasn't thawed yet
Well if we meet again
Meet and meet and meet and meet again
Can you catch the can if you can fill it


How will you want something to hit with
Again and again and again and again
Whats your crime?
Whats your crime?
Well how will you want
How will she sit
Whats been and again and again and again and again
Whats your crime?
Whats your whats your whats your whats your whats your crime (3x)
