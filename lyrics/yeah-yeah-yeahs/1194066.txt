I don't think I'll find a love
I want , the love i'm searching for in this machine , oh 
Visions fail and all the circuits blow and 
the message lost in this machine , oh


I tried, you know I'll try, I'll try
and hard as it may be, you know you should be with me
even though it seems its all a lie
I still believe you should be with me

I tried, you know I'll try, I'll try
and hard as it may be, you know you should be with me
even though it seems its all a lie
I still believe you should be with me
