Makes me feel like a madman on the run
Find me never never far gone
So get your leather, leather
leather on on on on


Your zero
What's your name?
No one's gonna ask you
Better find out where they want you to go
Try and hit the spot
Get to know it in the dark
Get to know it whether you're
Crying, crying, crying oh oh
Can you climb, climb, climb higher

Shake it like a ladder to the sun
Makes me feel like a madman on the run

So get your leather leather
leather on on on on
