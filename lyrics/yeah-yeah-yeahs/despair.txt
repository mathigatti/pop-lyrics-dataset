Don't despair, you're there
From beginning to middle to end
Don't despair, you're there through my wasted days
You're there through my wasted nights


Oh despair, you've always been there
You've always been there, you've always been there
You were there through my wasted years
Through all my lonely fears, no tears
Run through my fingers, tears
They're stinging my eyes, no tears
If it's all in my head there's nothing to fear
Nothing to fear inside
Through the darkness and the light
Some sun has got to rise

My sun is your sun
Your sun is our sun...

Oh despair, you were there through my wasted days
You're there through my wasted nights
You're there through my wasted years
You're there through my wasted life
You've always been there,
You've always been there, you've always been there
You were there through my wasted years
Through all of my lonely fears
Run through my fingers, tears
They're stinging my eyes, no tears
We're all on the edge, there's nothing to fear
Nothing to fear inside
Through the darkness and the light
Some sun has got to rise

My sun is your sun
Your sun is our sun...
