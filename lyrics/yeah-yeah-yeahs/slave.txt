It eats your soul, like tears you fall, my slave
You steal, you heed the call, my slave
The keys, the keys are gone, my slave
You keep me beating on


It eats your soul, like tears you fall, my slave
You steal, you heed the call, my slave
You keep me, you keep me, your slave
You keep me, you keep me, your slave

On my own
You keep me, you keep me
On the throne
Heads down all day
On my own
You keep me, you keep me
On the throne
Heads down all day

You keep me, you keep me, your slave
You keep me, you keep me, your slave

Come feed on your love...
Come feed on your love...
