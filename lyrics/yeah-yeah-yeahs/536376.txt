My arms are all twisted
The only thing I miss is
I messed up I missed it,
I messed up, the missing of you


It's getting to sound like they've seen you around with her

No mystery
No mystery
No mysteries

Everyone knows the secretest code of mine
They'll tell all my friends and they'll tell all my enemies too

Mystery
No mysteries
No mysteries

No mystery
No mystery
No mysteries

- Take it away, Nick!

Well I don't even know what it's like not to go back to you
I don't even know who I like less
You own me, you own me, you own me oooh
Well it's anyone's, anyone's guess
It's anyone's, anyone's guess

Stress, stress, stress, twist, stress, stress, stress, stress, stress
