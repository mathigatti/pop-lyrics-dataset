My boys is paris
He's wrapped in fancy dinners
He sells life
He's lost and found his way again


I'll mesmorize a thing or two

Well dead sexes
Well dead sexes

My boy's Dallas
He's wrapped in hide and leather
He breaks stride

He's lost and found his way again&gt;
Blowhard
Blowhard
Blowhardddddd
Ohh dead sexy
