Checked my glove for the cash
It was all for the one
For the one
Slept my baby through it all
Checked my door for the crash
Shut like the first, you shut the last
I won,I won
Slept my baby through it all
I want out
I want out
I want out
I want out


Refr√£o:

Drop drop
Down a floor
Shoot shoot
Out your mouth
These days are scraped from seilings

These days are scraped from ceilings
I want out

Love is in the metal
Love is in the metal
Love is in the metal
Love is in the ooh-ooh
Who loves who?
