Let's go
Power Super Super Power (x2)


Would you like to play a game of hide and seek now?
If you have X-ray eyes please promise no to peek now
Well first we count to ten, and then we'll have some fun now
Or will you fly away before we count one now?

Signal in the sky-oh
That's when you know that you have to fly-oh
Signal in the sky, oooooohhhhhhh!!!!

Let's go! You know you got a lot do, ooh
Let's go! And everything depends on you, oooh

Hey girls, hey girls, come out and play now!
Or do you have to hurry off and save the day now?
Can't you come over, watch a movie with your friends now?
Or will you fly away before we see the end now?

Signal in the sky-oh
That's when you know that you have to fly-oh
Signal in the sky, oooooohhhhhhh!!!!

Let's go! You know you got a lot do, ooh
Let's go! And everything depends on you, oooh

Power Super Super Power! (x2)

Signal in the sky-oh
That's when you know that you have to fly-oh
Signal in the sky, oooooohhhhhhh!!!!

Let's go! You know you got a lot do, ooh
Let's go! And everything depends on you, oooh
