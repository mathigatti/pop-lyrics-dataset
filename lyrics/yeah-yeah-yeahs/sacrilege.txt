The sky
Halo round his head
Feathers in a bed
In our bed, in our bed

The sky
Halo round his head
Feathers in a bed
In our bed, in our bed

Asked if I would try
To leave this all behind
Halo round his head
Feathers in a bed
In our bed, in our bed

And I plead and I pray
And I plead and I pray
And I plead and I pray
And I plead and I pray
