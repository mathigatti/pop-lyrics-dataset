Love is real, real is love
Love is feeling, feeling love
Love is wanting to be loved


Love is touch, touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved

Love is you
You and me
Love is knowing
We can be

Love is free, free is love
Love is living, living love
Love is needing to be loved
