The years have passed so quickly
One thing I've understood
I am only learning
To tell the trees from wood


I know what's coming down
And I know where it's coming from
And I know and I'm sorry (yes I am)
But I never could speak my mind

And I know just how you feel
And I know now what I have done
And I know and I'm guilty
But I never could speak my mind

I know what I was missing
But now my eyes can see
I put myself in your place
As you did for me

Today I love you more than yesterday
Right now I love you more right now

Now I know what's coming down
I can feel where it's coming from
And I know it's getting better all the time
As we share in each other's minds

Today I love you more than yesterday
Right now I love you more right now
Ooh hoo no more crying
Ooh hoo no more crying
Ooh hoo no more crying
Ooh hoo no more crying
