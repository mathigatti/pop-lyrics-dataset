Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down 


Nobody ever loved me like she does
Ooh, she does
Yes, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Ooh, she do me
Yes, she does 

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down 

I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last?
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past 

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down 

And from the first time that she really done me
Ooh, she done me
She done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Ooh, she done me
She done me good 

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
