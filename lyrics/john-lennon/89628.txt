Don't wanna be a drag, everybody gotta bag
I know you know, 'bout the emperor's clothes


You don't know what you got, until you lose it
You don't know what you got, until you lose it
You don't know what you got, until you lose it
Oh baby, baby, baby gimme one more chance

Well it's Saturday night and I just gotta rip it up
Sunday morning I just gotta give it up
Come Monday momma and I just gotta run away
You know it's such a drag to face another day

You don't know what you got, until you lose it
You don't know what you got, until you lose it
You don't know what you got, until you lose it
Oh baby, baby, baby gimme one more chance

You know the more it change, the more it stays the same
You gotta hang on in, you gotta cut the string

You don't know what you got, until you lose it
You don't know what you got, until you lose it
You don't know, you don't know what you got, until you lose it
Oh baby, baby, baby gimme one more chance
