I've got every reason on earth to be mad, 'cause I've just
Lost the only girl I had. If I could get my way, I'd get
Myself locked up today, but I can't so I cry instead.
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet, I
Can't talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
I'd try to make you sad somehow, but I can't so I cry instead.
Don't want to cry when there's people there, I get shy when
They start to stare, I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But I'll come back again someday.
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls, I'm gonna
Break their hearts all 'round the world. Yes, I'm gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can.
