I've been told when a boy kiss a girl
Take a trip around the world
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
Yes they say you do


My girl says when I kiss her lips
Get the thrill thru fingertips
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
Yeah she said you do

Well I talk about boys
Don't you know I mean boys
Well I talk about boys now

Ah, boys
Well I talk about boys now
What a bundle of joy
My girl says when I kiss her lips
Get the thrill thru fingertips
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
Yeah she said you do

Well I talk about boys
Don't you know I mean boys
Well I talk about boys now
Ah, boys
Well I talk about boys now
What a bundle of joy.
