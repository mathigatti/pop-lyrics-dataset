Any time at all 
Any time at all 
Any time at all 
all you've gotta do is call 
And I'll be there 


If you need somebody to love 
Just look into my eyes 
I'll be there to make you feel right 
If you're feeling sorry and sad 
I'd really sympathize 
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight 

Any time at all 
Any time at all 
Any time at all 
all you've gotta do is call 
And I'll be there 

If the sun has faded away 
I'll try to make it shine 
There is nothing I won't do 
If you need a shoulder to cry on 
I hope it will be mine 
Call me tonight and I'll come to you 

Any time at all 
Any time at all 
Any time at all 
all you've gotta do is call 
And I'll be there 

Any time at all 
Any time at all 
Any time at all 
all you've gotta do is call 
And I'll be there 
Any time at all 
all you've gotta do is call 
And I'll be there.
