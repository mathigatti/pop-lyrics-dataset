[Sean]
Daddy, when did we have no house?
[John]
When?
[Sean]
When... When did we have no house and we rented this house?
[Yoko]
In 1973 we didn't have this house yet. That's when we bought this
house
[Sean]
Oh!
[John]
Two years before you were born
[Sean]
Oh, and I wasn't coming with you to find this house?
[John]
No, you weren't born yet. You were still in the sky
[Sean]
Oh! And when I came back, uh, down here, what did I landed on?
[John]
A little... a little cardboard box with a little blanket in
Little teeny tiny... Teeny tiny little Sean
[...] in a little tiny cardboard box
They used to have apples in it
And you used to do this here
[Sean]
I never heard of that apple box!
[John]
Well, a little cardboard box like that, see?
Like, they bring groceries in and it was you instead of the groceries
