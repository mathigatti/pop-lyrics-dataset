Grow old along with me,
The best is yet to be.
Well our time has come,
We will be as one.
God bless our love, God bless our love.


Grow old along with me,
Two branches of one tree.
Face the setting sun,
When the day is done.
God bless our love, God bless our love.

Spending our lives together,
man and wife together
World without end, love without end

Grow old along with me,
Whatever fate may be,
we will see it through, for our love is true
God bless our love, God bless our love,
God bless our love, God bless our love.
