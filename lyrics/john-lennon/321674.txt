Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know, I need someone
Help 


(When)
When I was younger, so much younger than today (I never needed)
I never needed anybody's help in any way (now)
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured (and now I
find)
Now I find, I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors 

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you, please, please help me? 

(Now)
And now my life has changed in, oh, so many ways (my
independence)
My independence seems to vanish in the haze (but)
But every now and then I feel so insecure (I know that I)
I know that I just need you like I've never done before 

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you, please, please help me?

Help me, help me
