- "alright, the happy rishi kesh song"

All you need to do
Is to say this little word,
I know it sounds absurd
But it's true.
The magic's in the mantra,
We'll give you all the answers
So swallow this,
That's all you've got to do.


Ev'rything you need is here,
And ev'rything that's not here,
Is not there.
And yet there's something missing
In this god almighty plan,
Could it be you need a woman?

Ah now, all you need to do
Is to say this little word,
I know it sounds absurd
But it's true.
The magic's in the mantra,
We'll give you all the answers
So swallow this,
That's all you've got to do.

But still...

You're so suicidal,
Something is wrong.
This can't be it
Something is wrong.

Uuh -

Something is wrong,
Something is wrong,
Something is wrong,
