From my girlfriend so far away
Please mister postman look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me

I've been standing here waiting Mister Postman
So patiently for just a card

Saying she's returning home to me
Please Mister Postman

So many days you past me by
See the tears standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or letter

I've been waiting such a long long time
Since I heard from that gal of mint

You gotta, wait a minute wait a minute oh yeah
Wait a minute wait a minute oh yeah
