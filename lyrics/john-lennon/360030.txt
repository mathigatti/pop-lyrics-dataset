Mucho mungo, sweet thing,
Sweetest little thing i've ever seen.
It must have been a sweet dream,
Brought you here,
Brought you through the sorrow
And the tears.


C'est la, c'est la, c'est la vie,
Sail upon the ocean, sail with me.
Sail into tomorrow ev'ry day,
Just looking for the sunshine
Through the haze.

But wait! what's this
I see?
Could it be?

Mount elga, mount elga,
A high mountain,
I climb as i'm dreaming, a-huh.
Mount elga, mount elga,
A high mountain,
I climb as i'm dreaming,
Catching me hell.
To climb this hill
The more i try to climb,
I'm slipping still.

Me body run down,
Me feeling weak.
The more i try to climb up
This mountain peak.

Mucho mungo, sweet thing,
Sweetest little thing since sweet sixteen.

C'est la, c'est la, c'est la vie,
Sail across the ocean,
Sail with me.
