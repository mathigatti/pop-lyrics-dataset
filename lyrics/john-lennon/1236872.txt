Oh dear what can I do,
Baby's in black and I'm feelin' blue.
Tell me oh, what can I do?


She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black.

Oh dear what can I do,
Baby's in black and I'm feelin' blue.
Tell me oh, what can I do?

I think of her
But she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim
She thinks of him.

Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?

Dear what can I do,
Baby's in black and I'm feelin blue.
Tell me oh, what can I do?

Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?

Dear what can I do,
Baby's in black and I'm feelin blue.
Tell me oh, what can I do?

She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black.

Oh dear what can I do,
Baby's in black and I'm feelin' blue
Tell me oh, what can I do?
