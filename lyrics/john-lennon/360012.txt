Oh, dirty maggie mae,
They have taken her away,
And she'll never walk down lime street any more.


Oh, the judge he guilty found her
Of robbin' the homeward bounder,
That dirty, no good, robbin' maggie mae.

North of liverpool;

Oh, something down,
Went down on number nine,
T'was down in kelly's pornshop, number nine.

Oh, dirty maggie mae,
They have taken her away,
And she'll never walk down lime street any more.

Oh, the judge he guilty found her
