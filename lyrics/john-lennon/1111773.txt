All I gotta do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
Yeah, that's all I gotta do


And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeah
All I gotta do
Is whisper in your ear
the words you want to hear
And I'll be kissing you

Whenever you call
You just gotta call on me, yeah
You just gotta call on me

And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeh
