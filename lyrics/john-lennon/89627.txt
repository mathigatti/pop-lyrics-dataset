Ain't no people on the old dirt road
No more weather on the old dirt road
It's better than a mudslide mamma when the dry spell come, yeah
Oh oh oh old dirt road


Ain't no difference on the old dirt road
Tarred and feathered on the old dirt road
Trying to shovel smoke with a pitchfork in the wind, yeah yeah yeah

Breezing thru the deadwood on a hot summer day
I saw a human being lazybonin' out in the hay
I said uh, hey Mr. Human can ya rainmaker too?
He said I guess it's O.K. ya know the only thing we need is water
Cool, clear water, water

Ain't no people on the old dirt road
No more weather on the old dirt road
Better than a mudslide mamma when the morning comes, yeah
Oh oh oh oh old dirt road

Keep on keeping on
Keep on keeping on
So long, so long
Bye bye
