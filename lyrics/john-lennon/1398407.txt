Baby´s good to me you know
She´s happy as can be you know
And said so
I´m in love with her and I feel fine


Baby says she´s mine you know
And she tells me all the time you know
She said so
I´m in love with her and I feel fine

I´m so glad that she´s my little girl
She´s so glad, she´s telling all the world
That her baby buys her things you know
He buys her a diamond ring you know
She said so
She´s in love with me and I feel fine
