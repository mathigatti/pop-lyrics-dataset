I bought a brand new airmobile,
It was a custom made, it was a flightning deal.
With a powerful motor and a hide away wing,
Push in on the button, you will hear her sing.


Now, you can't catch me,
Baby, you can't catch me,
'cause if you get too close,
You know i'm goin' like cool breeze.

Hey! hey!
Well, you walk!
You walk!

New jersey turnpike in the wee wee hours,
I was rollin' slowly 'cause of drizzle showers.
Here come a flat-top, he was movin' up with me,
Then come waving goodbye in a little, old souped up jitney.
I put my foot in the tank, i began to roll,
Moanin' siren, 'twas the state patrol.
I let out my wings, then i blew my horn,
Bye-bye, new jersey, i become airborn.

Now, you can't catch me,
Baby, you can't catch me,
'cause if you get too close,
You know i'm goin' like cool breeze.

Hey!
Well, you walk!
Yeah, walk!

Flying with my baby last saturday night,
Wasn't a grey cloud floatin' in sight,
Big, full moon, shinin' up above,
Cuddle up, honey, be my love.

Sweetest little thing that i ever seen,
I'm gonna name you maybellene.
Flying on the beam, set on flight control,
Radio tuned to rock and roll.
Two, three hours passed us by,
Altitude dropped into five-o-five.
Fuel consumption, way too fast,
Let's get on home before we run out of gas.

Now, you can't catch me,
Baby, you can't catch me,
'cause if you get too close,
You know i'm goin' like cool breeze.

Git it on!
Yeah, walk!
Git it on, git it on, git it on, do it!
Git it on, git it on.
You know you can't catch me!
