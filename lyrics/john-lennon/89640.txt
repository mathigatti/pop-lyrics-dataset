Kiss, Kiss, Kiss, Kiss me love,
Just one kiss, kiss will do,
Kiss, kiss kiss, kiss me love,
Just one kiss, kiss will do,


Why death,
Why Life,
Warm hearts,
Cold darts,

Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love,
I'm bleeding inside,

It's a long, long story to tell,
And I can only show my hell,

Touch, touch, touch, touch me love,
Just one touch, touch will do,
Touch, touch, touch, touch me love,
Just one touch, touch will do,

Why me,
Why you,
Broken mirror,
White terror,

Touch, touch, touch, touch me love,
I'm shaking inside,
It's that faint, faint sound of the childhood bell,
Ringing in my soul,

Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love,
Just one kiss, kiss will do.
