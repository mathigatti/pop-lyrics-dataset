Anna, you come and ask me girl
To set you free girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him (Anna) go with him (Anna)


Anna, girl before you go now
I want you to know now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more, go with him

All of my life, I've been searching for a girl
To love me, like I love you, oh now
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do
oh oh oh oh oh oh

Anna, just one more thing girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free, go with him

All of my life, I've been searching for a girl
To love me, like I love you, but let me tell you now
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I suppost to do
oh oh oh oh oh oh

Anna, just one more thing girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him (Anna) go with him (Anna)
You can go with him girl (Anna) go with him
