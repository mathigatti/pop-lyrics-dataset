Mountains may move
River may run
But you make me be myself
You make me be
How do I tell you
How do I tell
You're the one 


Stars may move
Time may run
But you make me free myself
You make me free
How do I tell you
How do I tell
You're the one
You're the one 

In the world's eye
We were Laurel and Hardy
In our minds
We were Heathcliff and Cathy
In a moment of wisdom
We were a wizard and a witch
In a moment of freedom
We were Don Quijote and Sancho
In reality
We were just a boy and a girl
Who never looked back 

How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How can I tell you
How could I tell you 

You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one...
