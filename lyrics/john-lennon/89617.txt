Only people just know how to talk to people
Only people know just how to change the world
Only people realize the power of people
A million heads are better than one, so come on, get it on!


Well I know how we tried and the millions of tears that we cried
Now we are hipper we been thru the trip
And we can't be denied with woman and man side by side
Make no mistake it's our future we're making,
bake the cake and eat it too!
We don't want no pig brother scene

Well it's long overdue there
ain't nothing better to do
Now we are hipper we been thru the trip
We can fly right on thru, there's nothing on earth we can do
Fish or cut bait it's our future
e're making all together now pull the chain!
We don't want no pig brother scene
