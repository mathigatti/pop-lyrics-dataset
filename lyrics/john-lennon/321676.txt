Uh,
Ow!
Yeah.


The night we met I knew I needed you so,
And if I had the chance I never let you go.
So won't you say you love me,
I'll make you so proud of me,
We'll make them turn their heads ev'ry place we go.

So won't you, please, (be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby, (my one and only, baby)
Say you'll be my darling, (be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now, (my one and only, baby)
Oh, oh, oh.

Come on, baby,
Do it nice!
Slow!
That's right!

Ow!
So knocking, it's...
It's damned!

Ow!
Hey!
Oh!
It's too much!
I don't know.

Ow!
Yeah!
Ow!
Uh!
Oh, now, baby, baby, baby.

And since the day I saw you,
You know I was waiting for you,
And you know I'm gonna adore you till eternity, yeh!

Oh, baby, (be my, be my baby)
Bay, baby, baby, baby, babe, (my one and only, baby)
Come on, baby, be mine, (be my, be my baby)
Oh, please, please, my only one. (my one and only, baby)

Won't you please, (be my, be my baby)
Oh yeah, (my one and only, baby)
Be my baby, (be my, be my baby)
I mean it, darling! (my one and only, baby)
