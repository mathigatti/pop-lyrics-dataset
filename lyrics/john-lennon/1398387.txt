She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


You think you´ve lost your love
Well i saw her yesterday
It´s you she´s thinking of
And she told me what to say

She says she loves you
And you know that can´t be bad
She loves you
And you know you should be glad

She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
But now she says she knows
You´re not the hurting kind

She says she loves you
And you know that can´t be bad
She loves you
And you know you should be glad

She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad

You know it´s up to you
I think it´s only fair
Pride can hurt you to do
Apologize to her

Because she loves you
And you know that can´t be bad
She loves you
And you know you should be glad

She loves you yeah,yeah,yeah...
