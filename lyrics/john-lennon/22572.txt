Gonna knock you right in the head
You better get yourself together
Pretty soon your gonna be dead


What in the world you thinking of?
Laughing in the face of love
What on Earth you try'na do?
It's up to you

Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna knock you right in the face

Why in the world are we here?
Surely not to live in pain and fear
Why on Earth are you there
