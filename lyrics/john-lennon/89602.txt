Well it was sunday
bloody sunday
When they shot the people there
The crys of thirteen marty martyrs
Filled the free derry air.
Is there any one among you
Dare to blame it on the kids?
Not a soldier boy was
bleeding


When they nailed the
coffin lidds!

Sunday bloody sunday
Bloody sunday's the day!

You claim to be majority
Well you know that it's a lie
You're really a minority
Oh this sweet emerald asle.
When Stormont bans
our marchers

They've got a lot to learn
Internment is no answer
It's those mother's turn
to burn!

Sunday bloody sunday
Bloody sunday's the day!

You anglo pigs and scotties
Sent to colonize the north
You wave your bloody
Union Jacks
And you know what it's worth!
How dare you hold on to ransom
A people proud and free
Keep ireland for the irish
Put the english back to sea!

Sunday bloody sunday
Bloody sunday's the day!

Yes it's always bloody sunday
In the concentration camps
Keep Falls and roads free forever
From the bloody english hands

Repatriate to britain
All of you who call it home
Leave ireland to the irish
Not for London or for Rome!

Sunday bloody sunday
Bloody sunday's the day!
