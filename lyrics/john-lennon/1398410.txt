If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the colour that my baby wore
And what is more, it's true
Yes it is


Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I've sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

"Please don't wear red tonight."
This is what I said tonight
For red is the colour that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

"Please don't wear red tonight."
This is what I said tonight
For red is the colour that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
