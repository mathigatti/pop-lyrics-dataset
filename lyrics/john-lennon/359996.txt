"ah, remember this?
Why, i must have been thirteen when this came out!
Or was it fourteen?
Or was it twenty-two?
I could have been twelve actually."


Just because you left and said goodbye,
Do you think that i will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so,
Darling, i would rather let you go.

Just because i want someone who's kind,
With a heart as good and pure as mine.
But maybe i am asking for too much,
Darling, please don't ever break my heart.

I know you think you're smart,
Just runnin' around breaking lovers hearts.

Just because you left and said goodbye, hey!
Do you think that i will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so,
Darling, i would rather let you go.

Uh-uh-uh -

"this is doctor winston o'boggie saying goodnight
From record plant east, new york.
We hope you had a swell time!
Ev'rybody here says "hi".
Goodbye."

Just because you left and said goodbye,
Do you think that i will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so,
Darling, i would rather let you go.

Uh-uh-uh -
Goodbye!
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh -
So long!
Been a long year!
