You know
If you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again


'Cause I
Told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so
I'm the one who want you
Yes I'm the one who want you... ooh

You could buy many things to do
That you break my heart again

This time
I'll try to show that I
I'm trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
That if I run away from you
That you would want me too
And I'm gonna be surprise... ooh

I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to live you... ooh
