Though you've gone away this morning,
You'll be back again tonight,
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I don't just don't treat you right,
You'll never leave me and you know it's true,
'cause you like me too much and I like you.


You've tried before to leave me, 
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve,

You'll never leave me and you know it's true,
'cause you like me too much and I like you.
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me,
If you leave me 

I will follow you 
And bring you back where you belong
'cause I could't really stand it,
I admit that I was wrong,

I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true,
'cause you like me too much and I like you.

If you leave me 

I will follow you 
and bring you back where you belong
'cause I could't really stand it,
I admit that I was wrong,

I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true,
'cause you like me too much and I like you.
