Out the blue you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue, life's energy
Out the blue you came to me


Every day I thank the lord and lady
For the way that you came to me
Anyway it had to be two minds
One destiny

Out the blue you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue, life's energy
Out the blue you came to me

All my life's been a long slow knife
I was born just to get to you
Anyway I survived long enough
To make you my wife

Out the blue you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue life's energy
Out the blue you came to me

Like a u.f.o. You came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue, life's energy
Out the blue you came to me
