Woman is the nigger of the world
Yes she is
Think about it
Woman is the nigger of the world
Think about it
Do something about it


We make her paint her face and dance
If she won't be a slave, we say that she don't love us
If she's real, we say she's trying to be a man
While putting her down we pretend that she's above us

Woman is the nigger of the world
Yes she is
If you don't believe me
Take a look at the one you're with
Woman is the slave of the slaves
Oh yeah, better scream about it

We make her bear and raise our children
And then we leave her flat for being a fat old mother hen
We tell her home is the only place she should be
Then we complain that she's too unworldly to be our friend

Woman is the nigger of the world
Yes she is
If you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with
Woman is the slave to the slaves
Yeah, alright

We insult her every day on TV
And wonder why she has no guts or confidence
When she's young we kill her will to be free
While telling her not to be so smart we put her down for being
so dumb

Woman is the nigger of the world
Yes she is
If you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with
Woman is the slave to the slaves
Yes she is
If you don't believe me, you better scream about it

We make her paint her face and dance (x7)
