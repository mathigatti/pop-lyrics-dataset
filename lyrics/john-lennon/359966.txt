We like to do the last number and go and recover

One, two, three, four

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine


When they said that you was highclassed
That was just a lie
When they said that you was highclassed
That was just a lie
You ain't never caught no rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't never caught no rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't never caught a rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine

Well, they said that you was highclassed
Well, that was just a lie
Well, they said that you was highclassed, babe
You know it's a lie
You ain't never caught no rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Elvis, I love you
You ain't never caught no rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine
