Angela, they put you in
prison
Angela, they shot down
your man
Angela, you're one of the
millions of political
prisioners in the world.


Sister, there's wind that
never dies
Sister, we're breathing
together
Sister, our loves and hopes
forever keep
on moving oh so slowly
in the world.

Angela, can you hear the
earth is turning?
Angela, the world
watches you.

Angela, you soon will be
returning to your sisters and
brothers of the world.

Sister, you`re still a people
teacher
Sister, your word reaches far
Sister, there`s a million
different races but we all
share the same future
in the world.

They gave you sunshine
They gave you sea
They gave you everything but
the jailhouse key.
They gave you coffee
They gave you tea
They gave you everything
but equality.
