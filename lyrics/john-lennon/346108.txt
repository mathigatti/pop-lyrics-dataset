This day and age we're living in 
Gives cause for apprehension 
With speed and new invention 
And things like fourth dimension 
Yet we get a trifle weary 
With Mr. Einstein's theory 
So we must get down to earth at times 
Relax relieve the tension 
And no matter what the progress 
Or what may yet be proved 
The simple facts of life are such 
They cannot be removed 
You must remember this 
A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh 
The fundamental things apply 
As time goes by 
And when two lovers woo 
They still say, "I love you" 
On that you can rely 
No matter what the future brings 
As time goes by 
Moonlight and love songs 
Never out of date 
Hearts full of passion 
Jealousy and hate 
Woman needs man 
And man must have his mate 
That no one can deny 
Well, it's still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by 
Oh yes, the world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by
