Remember when you were young?
How the hero was never hung
Always got away
Remember how the man
Used to leave you empty handed?
Always, always let you down
If you ever change your mind
About leaving it all behind
Remember, remember today


Don't feel sorry
'Bout the way it's gone
Don't you worry
'Bout what you've done

Just remember when you were small
How people seemed so tall
Always had their way
Do you remember your ma and pa
Just wishing for movie stardom
Always, always playing a part
If you ever feel so sad
And the whole world is driving you mad
Remember, remember today

Don't feel sorry
'Bout the way it's gone
Don't you worry
'Bout what you've done

No, no, remember, remember
The fifth of november
