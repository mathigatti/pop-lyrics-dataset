- "at this time.....i just like to sing.."


Here in this lonely room,
Late in the afternoon
Dreaming my life away-hey.
Don't answer the telephone,
I'm not home receiving you.


Here in the afternoon,
Alone in some stranger's room,
What am i doing here at all?

No need to over do it,
I'm bleeding now,
I'm bleeding now.
Stop the bleeding now,
Stop the bleeding now.
Oozing out
Dripping down
Table's silent shout.

Aghhh!

(scat sing and whistle)

Stop the bleeding now.
