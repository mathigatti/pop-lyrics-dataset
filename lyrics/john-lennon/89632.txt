Sweet as the smell of success
Her body's warm and wet
She get's me through this god awful lonliness
A natural high butterfly Oh I,
I need, need, need her


Just like a willow tree
A breath of spring you see
And oh boy you don't know what she do to me
She makes me sweat and forget who I am
I need, need, need, need her

Well I was wondering how long this could go on, on and on
Well I thought I could never be surprised
But could it be that I bit my own tongue
Oh yeah, it's so hard to swallow when you're wrong

A bird of paradise
The sunrise in her eyes
God only knows such a sweet surprise
I was blind she blew my mind think that I
I love, love, love, love, love her
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her

Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love
