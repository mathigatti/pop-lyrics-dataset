Here in some stranger's room
Late in the afternoon
What am I doing here at all?
Ain't no doubt about it
I'm losing you


Somehow the wires have crossed
Communication's lost
Can't even get you on the telephone
Just got to shout about it
I'm losing you

Here in the valley of indecision
I don't know what to do
I feel you sliping away
I feel you sliping away
I'm losing you
I'm losing you

You say your not getting enough
But I remind you of all that bad stuff
So what the hell am I supposed to do?
Just put a bandaid on it?
And stop the bleeding now
Stop the bleeding now

I know I hurt you then
But that was way back when
And well, do you still have to carrey that cross?
Don't want to hear about it
I'm losing you
I'm losing you
