Oh, oh,
You've been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.


I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
That's the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
You've been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.
