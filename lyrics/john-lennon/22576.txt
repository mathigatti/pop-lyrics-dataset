Mother, you had me
But I never had you
I wanted you
You didn't want me


So I
I just got to tell you
Goodbye
Goodbye

Father, you left me
But I never left you
I needed you
You didn't need me

So I
I just got to tell you
Goodbye
Goodbye

Children, don't do
What I have done
I couldn't walk
And I tried to run

So I
I just got to tell you
Goodbye
Goodbye

Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home
Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home

Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home
Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home

Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home
Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home

Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home
Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home

Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home
Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home
