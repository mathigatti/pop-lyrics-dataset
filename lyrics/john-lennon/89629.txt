Bless you wherever you are
Windswept child on a shooting star
Restless Spirits depart
Still we're deep in each other's hearts


Some people say it's over
Now that we spread our wings
But we know better darling
The hollow ring is only last year's eco

Bless you whoever you are
Holding her now
Be warm and kind hearted
And remember though love is strange
Now and forever our love will remain
