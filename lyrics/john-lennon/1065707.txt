'Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members'

Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true
I love you more than ever girl I do


I want you in the morining girl I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living ev'ry moment girl for you

I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to do
I feel it now I hope you feel it too

Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true
I love you more than ever girl I do
