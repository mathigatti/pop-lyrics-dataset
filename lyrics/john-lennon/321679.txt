It's only sane to be insane
Psychotic builds a castle
And neurotic lives in it
I don't know what to do with my sanity
When the world's at the verge of calamity 


O' sanity, o' sanity
What am I to do with you
Drink up, shoot up, anything you please
But you're always standing behind me like a devil in hell 

O' sanity, o' sanity
Why don't you let me go
Let go, let go, cut it out!
