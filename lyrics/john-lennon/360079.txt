Slippin' and a-slidin', peepin' and a-hidin',
Been told a long time ago;
Slippin' and a-slidin', peepin' and a-hidin',
Been told a long time ago-ho.
I've been told, baby, you've been bold,
I won't be your fool no more.


Oh, big conniver, nothin' but a jiver
Done got hip to your jive;
Oh, big conniver, nothin' but a jiver
Done got hip to your jive.
Slippin' and a-slidin', peepin' and a-hidin',
Won't be your fool no more.

Yeah!

Oh, malinda, she's a solid sender,
You know you better surrender;
Oh, malinda, she's a solid sender,
You know you better surrender;
Slippin' and a-slidin', peepin' and a-hidin',
Won't be your fool no more.

Ho! ho!

Slippin' and a-slidin', peepin' and a-hidin',
Been told a long time ago;
Slippin' and a-slidin', peepin' and a-hidin',
Been told a long time ago-ho.
I've been told, baby, you've been bold,
I won't be your fool no more.

I won't be your fool no more, mama!
