Every man has a woman who loves him,
In rain or shine or life and death,
If he finds her in this lifetime,
He will know when he presses his ear to her breast,


Why do I roam when I know you're the one,
Why do I laugh when I feel like crying,

Every woman has a man who loves her,
Rise or fall of her life and death,
If she finds him in this life time,
She will know when she looks into his eyes,

Why do I roam when I know you're the one,
Why do I run when I feel like holding you,

Every man has a woman who loves him,
If he finds her in this lifetime,
He will know.
