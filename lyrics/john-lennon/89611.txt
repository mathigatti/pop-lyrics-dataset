When I'm down really yin
And I don't know what I'm doing
Aisumasen Yoko
All I had to do was call your name


And when I hurt you and cause you pain
Darling I promise I won't do it again

Aisumasen Yoko
It's hard enough I know just to feel your own pain

All that I know is just what you tell me
All that I know is just what you show me

When I'm down real sanpaku
And I don't know what to do
Aisumasen Yoko san
All I had to do was call your name
Yes, all I had to do was call your name
