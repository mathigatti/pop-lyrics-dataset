Just as tight a$ you can make it
Hard and slow ain't hard enough
Just as tight a$ you can shake it girl
Git it on and do your stuff


Tight a$ you can get it
Tight a$ got it made
Uptight's alright but if ya can't stand the heat
You better get back in the shade

Just as tight a$ an Indian rope trick
Long and tough ain't hard enough
Just as tight a$ a dope fiend's fix my friend
Git it up and do your stuff

Tight a$ you can boogie
Tight a$ got it made
Uptight's alright but if ya can't stand the heat
you better get back in the shade

Well tight a$ got me cornered
Tight a$ got me laid
Tight a$ strut your stuff so tough
Just a sweating in the midnight shade
