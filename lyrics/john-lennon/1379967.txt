When i find myself 
In times of trouble
Mother mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom 
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right 
In front of me
Speaking words of wisdom 
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom 
Let it be


And when the broken 
Hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer 
Let it be
For though they may 
Be parted there 
Is still a chance 
That they will see
There will be an answer 
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer 
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom 
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom 
Let it be

And when the night 
Is cloudy
There is still a light 
That shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow 
Let it be
I wake up 
To the sound of music
Mother mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom 
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer 
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
