So Sgt. Pepper took you by surprise
You better see right through that mother's eyes
Those freaks was right when they said you was dead
The one mistake you made was in your head
Tell me
Ah how do you sleep?
Ah how do you sleep at night?


You live with straights who tell you you was king
Jump when your mamma tell you anything
The only thing you done was "Yesterday"
And since you've gone it's just another day

Ah how do you sleep?
Ah how do you sleep at night?

Ah how do you sleep?
Ah how do you sleep at night?

A pretty face may last a year or two
But pretty soon they'll see what you can do
The sound you make is muzak to my ears
You must have learned something all those years

Ah how do you sleep?
Ah how do you sleep at night?
