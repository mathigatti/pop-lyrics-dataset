It feels alright now
Hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one


So hold me tight
tonight, tonight
it's you,
you, you, you, oo

Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you

So hold me tight
tonight, tonight
it's you,
you, you, you, oo

Don't know what it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you

It feels alright now
Hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one

So hold me tight
tonight, tonight
it's you,
you, you, you, oo

Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you


So hold me tight
tonight, tonight
it's you,
you, you, you, oo
you, oo
