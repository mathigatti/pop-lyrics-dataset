Well, he's no longer le grasson vital
He's just one of the boys
You know they say that he's aged very well
Still he's just one of the boys
You know he stays at the exclusive hotels
Yet he's still one of the boys


It doesn't matter how old you are
You're as dumb as you feel right now
Dumb as you feel right now
It does not matter how old you are

Well, he's no longer le grasson vital
But he's still one of the boys
They said, they said that he's aged very well
Still he's just one of the boys
He stays at all the exclusive hotels
Yet he's still just one of the boys

It does not matter how old you are
You're as young as you feel right now
It does not matter how old you are
You're as dumb as you feel right now

Well, he's no longer do do do do doo
Do do do do do do doo
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Down in the caribbean, it's not a dream you see
Do do do do do do do do do doo
He's just one of the boys
Do do do do do do do do do doo
He's just one of the boys
Do do do do do do do
One of the boys

It does not matter how old you are
You're as young as you feel right now
It does not matter how old you are - what!
