Even after all these years
I miss you when you're not here
I wish you were here my dear Yoko
Even if it's just a day
I miss you when you're away
I wish you were here today dear Yoko


Even if it's just one night
I miss you and it don't feel right
I wish you were here tonight dear Yoko
Even if it's just one hour
I wilt just like a fading flower
Ain't nothing in the world like our love dear Yoko

Oh Yoko
I'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna let you go
Oh Yoko
I'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna let you go

Even when I'm miles at sea
And nowhere is the place to be
Your spirit's watching over me dear Yoko
Even when I watch T.V.
There's a hole where you're supposed to be
There's nobody lying next to me dear Yoko

Oh Yoko
I'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna let you go
Oh Yoko
I'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna let you go

Even after all this time
I miss you like the sun don't shine
Without I'm a one track mind dear Yoko
After all is really said and done
The two of us are really one
The goddess really smiled upon our love dear Yoko
