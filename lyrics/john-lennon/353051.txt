Hello, hello, testing, testing...
At this time of year...oh, let me first introduce myself.
Maybe you have heard me before, i am the great wok.
And as you know, the great wok must be done.
Now, at this time of year when brahama is in brahma...
The day of brahma is set to last one thousand years and its night is of equal
length.
Well, for us human being, this is the end of the year now
And our minds turns towards what is laughably called the future.
No mind can comprehend the infinite and absolute anon munsch mars stunvelly humpff,
As we say in the himalayas.
Now let5 me tell you, my resolution of the year 1979 is to renounce complete
everything,
But complete luxury and self indulgance.
Now i suggest this is going to be very, very difficult, very difficult indeed.
I feel it's my duty, not only as a human being but as a person
Or was it not george formy who said there are four billion three hundred and twenty
million
Mortal or earth years which is one day of brahma.
So, one way of looking at it is simply not to look at it at all.
And that's exactly what we're going to do now.
So we'll settle down, deeply, i hope, and comfortably in an easy chair
And then, lay back, put the incense on, light the candles and give yourself a hard
time.
