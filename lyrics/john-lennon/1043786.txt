You don't realize how much
I need you.
Love you all the time,
Never leave you.


Please come on back to me.
I'm lonely as can be.
I need you.

Said you had a thing or two
To tell me.
How was I to know you would
Upset me.

I didn't realize
As I looked in your eyes.
You told me.

Oh, yes, you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore.
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this,
I just can't go on anymore.

Please remember how I feel
About you.
I could never really live
Without you.

So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me.
I need you.

But when you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore.
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this,
I just can't go on anymore.

Please remember how I feel
About you.
I could never really live
Without you.

So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me.
I need you.
I need you.
I need you.
