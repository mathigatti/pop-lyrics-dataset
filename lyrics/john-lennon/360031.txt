My life, take it, it's mine to give.
Take it, let me live in you.
My life, take it, it's yours.
Do what you will, i dedicate it to you.


What's the use in waking
If you're not there to share the dreams and nightmares?

My life, take it, for better or worse.
Why waste time?
We both know together is the only way.
We'll make it any way.
Take it, my life,
My life is you.

What's the use in waking
If you're not there to share the dreams and nightmares?

I've only myself to...
I've only myself to (give to) you.

For better or worse i dedicate my life to you.
La-la-la-la....
