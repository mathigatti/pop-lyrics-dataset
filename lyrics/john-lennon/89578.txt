I told you before stay away from my door
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother
The freaks on the phone won't leave me alone
So don't give me that brother, brother, brother
I found out


Now that I showed you just what I've been through
Don't take nobody's word what you can do
There ain't no Jesus don't come from the sky
Now that I found out I know I can cry
I found out!

Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand
Don't get you nowhere don't make you a man
I heard something about my ma and my pa
They didn't want me, so they made me a star
I found out!

Old Hare Krishna ain't got nothing on you
Just keep you crazy with nothing to do
Keep you occupied with with pie in the sky
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes
I found out!

I seen the junkies I've been through it all
I've seen religons from Jesus to Paul
Don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine
Can't do you no harm feel your own pain
I found out!
