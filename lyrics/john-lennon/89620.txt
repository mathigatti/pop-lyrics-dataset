From liverpool to tokyo
Too away to go
From distant lands one woman one man
Let the four winds blow


Three thousand miles over of the ocean
Three thousand light years from the land of the rising sun

Love has opened my eyes
Love has blown right through
Wherever you are (wherever you are), you are here (you are here)
Wherever you are (wherever you are), you are here (you are here)

Three thousand miles over of the ocean
Three thousand light years from the land of surprising sun
Well, now, east is east and west is west
The twain shall meet
East is west and west is east
Let it be complete

Three thousand miles over of the ocean
Three thousand light years from the land of the morning star
