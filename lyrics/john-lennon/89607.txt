There may be not much
difference
Between Chairmon Mao and
Richard Nixon
If we strip them naked.


There may be not much
difference
Between Marylin Monroe and
Lenny Bruce
If we check their coffins.

There may be not much
difference
Between White House and and
Hall of People
If we count their windows.

There may be not much
difference
Between Raquel Welch and
Jerry Rubin
If we hear their heartbeat.

We are all water from
different rivers
That's why it's so easy to to meet
We are all water in this vast,
vast ocean
Someday we'll evaporate
together.

There may be not much
difference
Between Eldridge Cleaver and
Queen of England
If we bottle their tears

There may be not much
difference
Between Charles Manson and the Pope
If we press their smile

There may be not much
difference
Between Rockefeller and you
If we hear you sing.

There may be not much
difference
Between Rockefeller and you
If we show our dreams
