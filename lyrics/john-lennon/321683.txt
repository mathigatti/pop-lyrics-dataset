F you ever change your mind,
About leaving, leaving me behind,
Oh, you'd better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet lovin',
Bring it on home to me.
Yeh, (yeh) yeh, (yeh) yeh.


You know I laughed,
Laughed when you left.
But now I know, I've only hurt myself.
Oh, you'd better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet lovin',
Bring it on home to me.
Yeh, (yeh) yeh, (yeh) yeh, yeh, yeh.

Oh, you'd better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet lovin',
Bring it on home to me.
Yeh, (yeh) yeh, (yeh) yeh.

You know I'll always be your slave,
Until I'm dead and buried in my grave.
Oh, you'd better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet lovin',
Bring it on home to me.
Yeh, (yeh) yeh, yeh.

Send me some lovin',
Send it I pray.
How can I love you
When you're so far away? 

Send me your picture,
Send it, my dear.
So I can hold it
And pretend you are here.

Send me your kisses,
I can feel your touch.
I need you, I need you so badly,
Don't you know I miss you so much? 

My days are so lonely,
My nights are so blue.
I'm here and I'm lonely,
Just waitin' for you.
