Yes, I'm your angel,
I'll give you everything,
In my magic power,
So make a wish,
and I'll let it come true for you,
Tra, la, la, la,


Yes, you're my fairy,
You give me everything,
I every wanted from life,
Have I made a wish,
And is that why I have you,
Tra, la, la, la,

We believe in pumpkins that,
Turn into princesses,
And frogs that turn into princes,
We believe in moons that smile to us,
When we hurry home before midnight strikes,
Tra, la, la, la,

Yes I'm so pretty,
You're so dizzy,
And we're so happy every day,
Let's make a wish,
And let it come true for us,

I'm in your pocket,
You're in my locket,
And we're so lucky in every way,
We make a wish,
And let it come true for us,

We believe in houses built in the sky,
And love that lifts us high,
We believe in sun that looks over our,
Shoulders and brings our shadows together,
Tra, la, la, la,

Yes,
Our hearts are one,
Our bodies, too,
And it's so good (um) everytime,
We make a wish,
And let it come true for you, too,

Happy birthday, my love,
I'm your angel,
I'll give you everything,
In my magic power,
So make a wish,
And I'll let it come true for you.
