Woke up this morning blues around my head
No need to ask the reason why
Went to the kitchen and lit a cigarette
Blew my worries to the sky


I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out

If it don't feel right you don't have to do it
Just leave a message on the phone and tell them to screw it
After all is said and done you can't go pleasin' everyone
So screw it...

I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out baby
I'm stepping out

Baby's sleeping the cats have all been blessed
Ain't nothing doing on TV (summer repeats)
Put on my space suit I got to look my best
I'm going out to do the city

I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out babe
I'm stepping out (boogie)

I'm stepping out (hold it down)
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
Gotta gotta gotta gotta get out
I'm stepping out babe
Just awhile
Ain't been out for days...
