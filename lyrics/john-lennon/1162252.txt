There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No I never heard them at all
Till there was you


There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you
