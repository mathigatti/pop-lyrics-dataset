Let me count the ways how I love you
It's like that gentle wind you feel at dawn
It's like that first sun that hits the dew
It's like that cloud with a gold lining telling us softly
That it'll be a good day, a good day for us
Thank you, thank you, thank you 


Let me count the ways how I miss you
It's like that oak tree in my childhood garden
It's like that first summer I spent in Egypt
It's like that warm evening you read to me
Both knowing deeply
That it's a good time, a good time for us
Thank you, thank you, thank you 

Let me count the ways how I see you
It's like that lake in the mountain you heard about
It's like that autumn sky that stays so blue
It's like that air around me that holds me gently
Whispering strongly that you're always there, always for me
Thank you, thank you, thank you
