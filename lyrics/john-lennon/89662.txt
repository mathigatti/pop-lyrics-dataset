you got to live
you got to love you got to be
somebody you got to shove
but it's so hard, it's really hard
sometimes i feel like going
down
you got to eat
you got to drink
you got to feel something
you got to worry
it's so hard, it's really hard
sometimes i feel like going
down
but when it's good it's oh so
good
and when i hold you in
arms baby
sometimes i feel like going
down
you got to run
you got to hide
you got to keep your woman
satisfied
but it's so hard, it's really hard
sometimes i feel like going
down
