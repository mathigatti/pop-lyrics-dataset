Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared to love
Better to love than never love at all
Don't be scared 


Don't be shy
Don't be shy
Don't be shy to tell
You may lose the chance to tell
Don't be shy 

When your hearts are lit
Drop your survival kit
Then you never have to
Run or split 

Sun in the east
Moon in the west
This boat's moving slow
There's no land in sight at all
Away we go 

Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared to love
It's better to love than never love at all
Don't be scared
