Moonlight on the water
Sun light on my face
You and me together
We are in our place
The gods are in the heavens
The angels treat us well
The oracle has spoken
We cast the (perfect) spell


Now it begins - let it begin
Cleanup Time
(Show those mothers how to do it)

The queen is in the counting home
Counting out the money
The king is in the kitchen
Making bread and honey
No friends and yet no enemies
Absolutely free
No rats aboard the magic ship
Of (perfect) harmony

Now it begins
Cleanup Time
(Show those mothers how to do it)

However, far we travel
Wherever we may roam
The centre of the circle
Will always be our home

The gods are in the heavens
The angels treat us well
The oracle has spoken
We cast the (perfect) spell
