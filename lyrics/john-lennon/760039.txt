I'm on the road to Rishikesh, I was dreaming more or less
And the dream I had was true, yes the dream I had was true


I'm just a Child of Nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a Child of Nature
I'm one of nature's children

Sunlight shining in my eyes, as I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home, yes my thoughts return to home

I'm just a Child of Nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a Child of Nature
I'm one of nature's children

Underneath the mountain ranges, where the wind never changes
Touch the windows of my soul, touch the windows of my soul

I'm just a Child of Nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a Child of Nature
I'm one of nature's children
