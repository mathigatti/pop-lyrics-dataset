Say you're looking for a place to go
Where nobody knows your name
You're looking for oblivion
With one
Eye on the Hall of Fame


I don't wanna face it oh no
I don't wanna face it no no no no
Well I can dish it out
But I just can't take it

Say you're looking for some peace and love
Leader of a big old band
You wanna save humanity
But it's people that you just can't stand

I don't wanna face it oh no
I don't wanna face it no no no no
Well I can sing for my supper
But I just can't make it

Well now you're lookin' for a world of truth
Trying to find a better way
The time has come to see yourself
You always look the other way

I don't wanna face it oh no
I don't wanna face it no no no no
Well I can see the promised land
And I know I can make it!

I don't wanna face it I know
I don't wanna face it oh no
I don't wanna face it oh no
I don't wanna face it

I don't wanna face it

I just can't face it no more
Every time I look in the mirror
I don't see anybody there
