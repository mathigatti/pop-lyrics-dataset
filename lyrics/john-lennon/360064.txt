We're the rock and roll people, born to pick the news;
Yeah, rock and people,
Just couldn't change it if i'd choose.


Don't tell me where your head is, man,
You know it won't be missed.
Don't play the virgin mary,
We all know she's been kissed.

Rock and roll people, born to be the news;
Yeah, we're rock and roll people,
Just couldn't change it if i'd choose.

My father was a mother,
My mother was a son.
Don't play the mona lisa,
We've all been twenty-one.

Rock and roll people, born to be the news;
Yeah, the rock and roll people,
Just couldn't change it if i choose.

Don't ask me 'bout the time of day,
Or how much space i need.
Don't feed me dog for dinner,
We all know you get green.

Rock and roll people, born to be the news;
Yes, the rock and roll people,
Just couldn't change it if i choose.

Sweet, sweet, rock and roll,
Sweet, sweet, rock and roll,
Sweet, sweet, rock and roll,
Sweet, sweet, rock and roll,
Sweet, sweet, rock and roll,
Sweet, sweet, rock and roll,
Sweet, sweet, rock and roll,
Sweet, sweet, rock and roll,
Rock and roll.
