Don't be afraid,
It's just the wind and light.
Don't be afraid,
This house is very strange.
In the morning we'll be gone, don't be afraid.


We'll watch the dawn till the sun comes up,
Drinking coffee from our favourite cup.
Girl, you've been good to me so don't be afraid tonight.

Don't be afraid,
It's just the cats at play.
Don't be afraid,
They do it night and day, how very strange.
They've gone by the morning so don't be afraid of me.

We'll dream around till the dawn comes up,
Drinking coffee from our favourite cup.
Girl, you've been good to me, don't be afraid tonight.

Don't be afraid,
Don't be afraid,
(scat sing) don't be afraid,
Mr. hyde, he's really gone away
Won't be back till next full moon
So we can bill and spoon
In june and croon, be-woon, be-woon, be
Can you stand it?
