Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you
Julia
Julia
Julia
Oceanchild
Calls me
So I sing a song of love
Julia
Julia
Seashell eyes
Windy smile
So I sing a song of love
Julia 


Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
Glimmering
In the sun 

Julia
Julia
Morning moon
Touch me
So I sing a song of love
Julia 

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind
Julia
Julia
Sleeping sand
Silent cloud
Touch me
So I sing a song of love
Julia 

Calls me
So I sing a song of love
For Julia
Julia
Julia
