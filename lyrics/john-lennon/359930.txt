Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out? 


Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright?
Alright?
Alright? 

You say you've got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan

Well, you know
We are doing what we can

Alright?
Alright? 

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head

Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright?
Alright?
Alright?
Alright?
Alright?
Alright?
