You can shine your shoes
And wear a suit
You can comb your hair
And look quite cute
You can hide your face
Behind a smile
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside


You can wear a mask
And paint your face
You can call yourself
The human race
You can wear a collar
And a tie
But the one thing you
Can't hide is when you're
Crippled inside

Well now you know that your
Cat has nine lives babe
Nine loves to itself
But you only got one
And a dog life ain't no fun
Mamma take a look outside

You can go to church
And sing a hymn
Judge me by the color
Of my skin
You can live a lie until you die
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside
