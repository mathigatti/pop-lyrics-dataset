Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well


I took my loved one out to dinner
So we could get a bite to eat
And though we both had been much thinner
She looked so beautiful I could eat her

Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well

I took my loved one to the big field
So we could watch the english sky
We both were nervous feeling guilty
And neither one of us knew just why

Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well

We sat and talked of revolution
Just like two liberals in the sun
We talked of woman's liberation
And how the hell we could get things done

Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well

I took my loved one to a big field
So we could catch the english sky
We both were nervous feeling guilty
And neither one of us knew just why

Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well!
