How can I go forward when I don't know
Which way I'm facing?
How can I go forward when I
Don't know which way to turn?
How can I go forward into something
I'm not sure of?


Oh no, oh no

How can I have feeling when I don't know
If it's a feeling?
How can I feel something if I
Just don't know how to feel?
How can I have feelings when
My feelings have always been denied?

Oh no, oh no

You know life can be long
And you got to be so strong
And the world is so tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough

How can I give love when I don't
Know what it is I'm giving?
How can I give love when I
Just don't know how to give?
How can I give love when love is something
I ain't never had?

Oh no, oh no

You know life can be long
And you got to be so strong
And the world is so tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough

How can we go forward when we
Don't know which way we're facing?
How can we go forward when
We don't know which way to turn?
How can we go forward into
Something we're not sure of?

Oh no, oh no
