Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said, baby, can´t you see?
I wanna be famous,
A star of the screen
But you can do something in between


Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, i´m gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe i´ll love you

I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said, baby, it´s understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But i can show you a better time

Baby you can drive my car... 2x

I told that girl i could start right away
And she said, listen me, i´ve got something to say
I got no car and it´s breaking my heart
But i´ve found a driver and that´s a start

Baby you can drive my car...
