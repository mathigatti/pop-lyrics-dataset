I got a girl named Bony Moronie
She's as skinny as a stick of macaronie
Oughta see her rock 'n' roll with her blue jeans on
She's not very fat, just skin and bone
But I love her, and she loves me
Oh, how happy now we can be
Making love underneath the appletree


Well I told her mama and her papa too
Just exactly what I wanna do
I wanna get married on a night in June
And rock 'n' roll by the light of the silvery moon
Cause I love her, and she loves me
Oh, how happy now we can be
Making love underneath the appletree

She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire
She's a real upseter she's a real life wire
Everybody turns when my baby walks by
She's something to see, she really catches the eye
That's why I love her, and she loves me
Oh, how happy now we can be
Making love underneatn the appletree
