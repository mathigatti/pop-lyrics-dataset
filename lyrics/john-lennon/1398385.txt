Before this dance it through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me


I don't want to kiss
Or hold your hand.
If it's funny,
Try and understand.
There is really nothing else
I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to
Dance with you

I don't need to hug
Or hold you tight
I just want to dance
With you all night
In this world, there's nothing
I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to
Dance with you

Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries
To take my place
Let's pretend we
Just can't see his face
In this world, there's nothing
I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to
Dance with you

Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries
To take my place
Let's pretend we
Just can't see his face
In this world, there's nothing
I would rather do
I discovered I'm in
Love with you.

'Cause I'm happy just to
Dance with you
