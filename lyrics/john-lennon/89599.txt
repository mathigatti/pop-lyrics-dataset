We are born in a prision,
Raised in a prision
Send to a prision called school,


We cry in a prision,
We love in a prision,
We live in a prision,
Like fools.

Wood becomes a flut when
It's loved,
Reach for your self and your
Battered mates.
Mirror becomes a razor when
It's broken,
Look in a mirror and see
Your shattered fate.

We live with no reason,
Kicked around for no reason,
Thrown out without reason
Like tools.

Work in a prision
And hate in aprision
And die in a prision
As a rule.

We live in a prision
Among judges and wardnes
And wait for no reason or use
We laugh in a prision,
Go through all four seasons
And die with no vision
Or truth
