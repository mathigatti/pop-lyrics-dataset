A bad little kid 
moved into my neighborhood 
He won't do nothing right 
just a sitting got to look so good 
He don't wanna go to school 
and learn to read and write 
Just sits around the house and plays 
that rock and roll music all night 
Well he put thumb tacks on teacher's chair 
put chewing gum in little girl's hair 
Now Junior behave yourself 


Buys every rock and roll book 
on the magazine stand 
Every dime that he gets 
oh he's off to the jukebox man 
Well he worries that teacher 
till at night she's aready to poop 
From rocking and a rolling 
spinning in a hula-hoop 
Well his rock and roll has gotta stop 
Junior's head is hard as rock 
Now Junior behave yourself, ow 

Gonna tell ya mamma 
you'd better do what she said 
Get to the barber shop 
and get that hair cut off your head 
You shoot the canary 
and you fed it to the neighbor's cat 
You have the cocker spaniel 
a bathing mother's laundromat 
Well ya mamma said it's gotta stop 
Junior's head is hard as a rock 
Now, Junior be have yourself, Ooo.
