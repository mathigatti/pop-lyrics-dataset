You are my weakness, you are my strength
Nothing I have in the world makes better sense
'Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea
When we're together or when we're apart
There's never a space in between the beat of our hearts
'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree


One day at a time is all we do
One day at a time is good for you

You are my woman, I am your man
Nothing else matters at all, now I understand
That I'm the door and you're the key
And every morning I wake in your smile
Feeling your breath on my face and the love in your eyes
'Cause you're the honey and I'm the bee

One day at a time is all we do
One day at a time is good for us two (you too)
