The food is cold,
Your eyes are cold,
The window's cold,
The bed is cold,


Give me something that's not cold,
Come on, come on,
Give me something that's not cold,
Come on, come on,
Give me something that's not cold,
Come on, come on,

The chair is hard,
Your voice is hard,
The money's hard,
The living's hard,

Give me something that's not hard,
Come on, come on,
Give me something that's not hard,
Come on, come on,
Give me something that's not hard,
Come on, come on,
Give me, give me,
And I'll give you a heartbeat,
And a bit of tear and flesh,
It's not very much but while it's there,
You can have it, you can have it.
