Sleepless night
The moon is bright
All I'm asking for is
Three minute love


Legs
What am I going to do with my legs
They're so hot
They won't stay on the cot
And they're screaming!

Sleepless night
The moon is bright
All I'm asking for is
Three minute love

Head
What am I going to do with my head
It's so light
It just gives me the fright
It's full of champagne and dreams

Sleepless night
All um umm
All I'm asking for is
Three minute love

This brush must sell like crazy
I mean there's a lot of lonely people out there

I wanna go to the ball
I wanna give it all
I'll take it all

Sleepless night
All I'm asking for is
What am I asking for?
