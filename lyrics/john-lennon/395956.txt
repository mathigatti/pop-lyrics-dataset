Your skin
So hot
Your skin
I even dream about it

In a day
No matter how many times we meet
It's not enough
In a lifetime
No matter how many times we meet
It's not enough 

Isshoni

In a lifetime
No matter how many times we meet
It's not enough
In many lifetimes
No matter how many times we meet
It's not enough
