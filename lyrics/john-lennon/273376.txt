Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever


Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

No one, I think, is in my tree
I mean, it must be high or low
That is, you can't, you know, tune in, but it's alright
That is, I think it's not too bad

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

Always, no, sometimes, think it's me
But, you know, I know when it's a dream
I think, er, no, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is, I think I disagree

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
