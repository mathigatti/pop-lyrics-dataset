Hey Jude
Don't make it bad
Take a sad song
And make it better


Remember
To let her into your heart
Then you can start
To make it better

Hey Jude
Don't be afraid
You were made to
Go out and get her

The minute
You let her under your skin
Then you'll begin
To make it better

And anytime you feel the pain
Hey Jude refrain
Don't carry the world
Upon your shoulders

For well you know that is a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world
A little colder

Hey Jude
Don't let me down
You have found her
And now go and get her

Remember
To let her into your heart
Then you can start
To make it better

So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with

Don't you know to that is just you
Hey Jude you'll do
The movement you need
Is on your shoulders

Hey Jude
Don't make it bad
Take a sad song
And make it better

Remember
To let her under your skin
Then you'll begin
To make it better
