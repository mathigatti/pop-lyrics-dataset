Hold on John, John Hold on
It's gonna be alright
You gonna win the fight


Hold on Yoko, Yoko hold on
It's gonna be alright
You gonna make the flight

When you're by yourself
And there's no one else
You just have yourself
And you tell yourself
Just to hold on

Hold on world, world hold on
It's gonna be alright
You gonna see the light

When you're one
really one
You get things done
like they've never been done
So hold on
