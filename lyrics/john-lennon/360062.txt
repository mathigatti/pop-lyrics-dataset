Well, it's saturday night and i just got paid,
Fool about my money, don't try to save.
My heart says, "go! go! have a time!"
'cause it's saturday night and, baby, i feel fine.


Gonna rip it up,
Gonna rock it up,
Gonna shake it up,
Gonna ball it up,
Gonna rock it up,
And ball the night.

I got me a date and i won't be late,
Picked her up in my eighty-eight.
Shag on down to the union hall,
When the joint starts jumpin', i'll have a ball.

Gonna rip it up,
Gonna rock it up,
Gonna shake it up,
Gonna ball it up,
Gonna rock it up,
And ball the night.

Whoa!

Well, ready, set, go man, go,
I got a girl that i love so.

And i'm ready,
Ready, ready, ted,
I'm ready,
Ready, ready, ted,
I'm ready,
Ready, ready, ted,
I'm ready, ready, ted to rock and roll.

Goin' to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie,
She's a rock and roll baby, she's the apple of my eye.

I'm ready,
Ready, ready, ted,
I'm ready,
Ready, ready, ted,
I'm ready,
Ready, ready, ted,
I'm ready, ready, ted to rock and roll.
