Recorded live at the varsity stadium, toronto, 13 September 1969

Yer blues, okay

One, two, yeah, one, two, three

Yes, I'm lonely, wanna die
Yes, I'm lonely, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Hoo, girl, you know the reason why


In the mornin', wanna die
In the evenin', wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Hoo, girl, you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth

I'm lonely, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Hoo, girl, you know the reason why

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like dylan's mister jones

Lonely, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Hoo, girl, you know the reason why

Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

I'm lonely, wanna die, yeah!
If I ain't dead already
Hoo, girl, you know the reason why
