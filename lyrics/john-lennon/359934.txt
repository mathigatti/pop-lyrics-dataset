Well, I tried so hard to settle down
But the angel of destruction keeps on houndin' me all around
But I know in my heart
The leaves are shining in the sun
That we never realy parted
Oh, no, oh, help me, Lord
Oh, help me, Lord
Please, help me, Lord, yeah, yeah
Help me to help myself
Help me to help myself


They say the lord helps those who helps themselves
So I'm asking this question in the hope that you'll be kind
'Cause I know deep inside
The leaves are shining in the sun
I was never satisfied
Oh, no, oh, help me, Lord
Please, help me, Lord, yeah, yeah
Help me to help myself
Help me to help myself
